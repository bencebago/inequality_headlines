        "text": "A demonstrator holds a \"Tax The Rich\" sign during a protest near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, on Thursday, April 10, 2025. As the United States reaches its 250th year, the widening gulf between the very rich few and the rest of us has become glaringly apparent. In 2024, the richest 10% held over 67%  of household wealth in the U.S., while the bottom half held just 2.4%. This wealth increasingly entitles one to power and privilege: there are numerous billionaires in key positions in the Trump Administration, and some (including the President) have used their public offices for financial gain. The Founders would be horrified by these developments because they believed great wealth in politics would corrupt and destroy the republic. Those beliefs were shaped by a range of influences: the widely read works by Roman historians who blamed the empire’s decline on a widening gap between rich and poor; radical Protestants who called for a Godly republic with limits on property or even its redistribution in a Great Jubilee every 50 years; James Harrington’s 1656 novel Oceana, describing an island country with a constitution that gave land to all and placed explicit limits on income and wealth; Enlightenment philosophers, particularly John Locke’s Two Treatises of Government (1689), which argued “all Men by Nature are equal” and that individuals should not hoard surplus wealth; and Cato’s Letters, a series written by British “radical Whigs” in the 1720s who, angered by the infamous South Sea Bubble, called for reforms while bitterly criticizing the corrupting ties between wealth and politics. Advertisement By the mid-18th century, Anglo-Americans generally believed in the virtues of a “rough” economic equality, that a republic needed to avoid concentrated wealth and great poverty in order to maintain the public good and prevent corruption. These ideals held particular power because they reflected the experiences of most British Americans. Widespread property ownership among white settlers meant that in every province a far higher percentage of white adult men could vote than in England. Even the wealthiest Southern planters needed the political support of their poorer—yet still property-holding—neighbors. Read More: How Insecurity Became the New Inequality The widespread embrace of these ideas can be glimpsed in the publication of Cato’s Letters in the Boston Independent Advertiser in 1748. The very first selection included the warning that when a man’s wealth “become immeasurably or surprising great,” the community “ought to make strict Enquiry, how they came by them, and oblige them” to surrender part of their riches. “But, will some say, is it a Crime to be rich? Yes, certainly. At the publick expence, or to the Danger of the Publick.”  The Advertiser was edited by Samuel Adams for artisans and laborers fired up by their successful resistance to impressment—the Navy’s effort to grab men for forced service—and concerned about rising poverty in the postwar depression. Sixteen years later, Adams would organize those artisans and laborers into the Sons of Liberty to resist British imperial measures. Advertisement These egalitarian ideas became more apparent as the conflict with London deepened and moved towards revolution. In his 1773 election sermon, Benjamin Trumbull warned Connecticut’s governor and legislators that if a few were allowed to “amass all the riches and wealth of a country” they would “by fraud or force . . . oppress and tyrannize over their fellow-men.” To avoid that evil, the community needed to keep property “as equally divided as possible.” Three years later, such a measure nearly became part of Pennsylvania’s first constitution when a delegate, probably Benjamin Franklin, proposed empowering the legislature to take “excessive” property from individuals because concentrations of wealth were “a danger to the happiness of mankind.” As the War for Independence widened and inflation became a major problem, many states and towns sought to regulate prices, in part for egalitarian reasons. For example, in May 1777, committees of safety in Plymouth County began their resolution supporting Massachusetts price limits by insisting that “the felicity, freedom, and happiness of a community” depends on “an equitable exchange of the fruits of the earth.” Two years later, as inflation returned, a huge Philadelphia gathering denounced the wealthy and elected a committee to lower prices. When a merchant committee condemned those restraints, the committee insisted that civil society required “subordination to the common good” and argued that those who had built the merchants’ ships were entitled to regulate goods carried on the vessels. Advertisement As the war ended, many white Americans believed that they lived in the most egalitarian country on earth, where most free men could vote due to, as Noah Webster wrote, the “general and tolerably equal distribution of landed property.” But they also feared a future aristocracy of wealth, and thus considered measures to forestall that evil.  Some called for limits on landholding, including the biblical Great Jubilee that would prevent “land monopoly” by cancelling debts and returning land to the original owners. Thomas Jefferson and others talked about progressive property taxes. And Thomas Paine called for a 10% estate tax to fund old-age pensions and a payment to every person at 21.  These proposals failed but there was one noticeable change: by 1800, nearly every state abolished the traditional laws of entail (permanently blocking the division or alteration of property) and primogeniture (inheritance of the entire estate by the eldest son) in order to encourage the division of large estates. At least in Virginia, those reforms, spearheaded by Jefferson, did reduce the size of inherited farms. Advertisement Read More: The Rise of America’s Broligarchy and What to Do About It Unfortunately, this focus on land overlooked the growing role of financial wealth: as trade and manufacturing flourished, power was increasingly measured in dollars rather than acres. When wage labor and economic inequality increased in the early 1800s, states extended the vote to all white men regardless of property. This severed the connection between property and polity, relieving pressure to limit wealth while making the racial barrier explicit.  But America’s egalitarian tradition did not disappear. It would be revived by Workingmen’s parties in the late 1820s, communitarian efforts in the 1840s, calls in the mid-1860s to redistribute Confederate plantations to freed Black men, and labor and farmer movements into the 20th century. More persistent has been the widespread fear that great wealth poses an existential threat to America’s democracy. Perhaps the 250th commemoration of the Revolution would be the time to again consider limits on excessive wealth and its political influence.

        "title": "7 Alarming Facts About Wealth Inequality: Bring On the Pitchforks?",
        "domain": "forbes.com",
        "text": "ByTeresa Ghilarducci, Senior Contributor. Ray Dalio, billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates, once warned that if America didn’t address its widening wealth gap, the rich might soon face mobs with pitchforks. Dalio stated, \"I believe that all good things taken to an extreme can be self-destructive, and that everything must evolve or die. This is true for capitalism.\"  Bridgewater, the world’s largest hedge fund, manages over $124 billion in assets.   Dalio is power speaking truth to power. While Dalio may not have used the 19th-Century word pitchforks, which was a referral to rebellion by peasants wielding actual pitchforks, his warning to fellow capitalists was seen as the same kind of warning.  Dalio’s pitchfork metaphor was no exaggeration. Now more than ever we are living in an era defined by a gaping and growing divide between the haves and have-nots. The photo of Elon Musk in a T-shirt standing beside President Trump in the Oval Office is a picture that punctuates the  numbers that tell the story of a deep divide between the elite and workers. 1. The Top 10% Own 93% of All Stocks: As of Q3 2023, the top 10% of Americans owned a record 93% of all U.S. stocks. A decade ago, that number was \"just\" 81%. Meanwhile, the bottom half of American households own less than 1% of stocks and mutual fund shares.  2. The Richest 1% Hold $25 Trillion in Stock Wealth: That top 1% owns more than half the total value of the public equity market—a concentration that would have been unimaginable a generation ago notes Inequalty.org.  3. The Median Retirement Savings for Half of Americans is $0: That’s right. Zero. For the bottom 50% of American families, the median retirement savings is nothing. In contrast, families in the top 10% hold a median of $610,000 explains the Economic Innovation Group (EIG).  4. Pension Wealth Has Grown 720% for the Richest 1%:  Between 1989 and 2021, pension entitlements for the top 1% grew by 720%, while the bottom 50% saw just a 470% increase, EIG adds. The richest added $14 trillion to their retirement wealth; the bottom half, only $716 billion.  5. Half of U.S. Workers Lack Retirement Plans: Roughly 50% of U.S. workers don’t have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, EIG explains. Workers in the top 25% are more than twice as likely to have access compared to those in the bottom 25%.  6. Elderly Americans Face the Highest Poverty Rate in the G7: According to the OECD, about 23% of Americans aged 66 and older live in relative income poverty—the highest rate in the G7. 7. The Racial Wealth Gap in Retirement is Stark: Median wealth for Black and Hispanic households is $24,000 and $36,000, respectively. For white households? $143,000, notes EIG. These disparities are compounded by lower access to retirement accounts and greater vulnerability to income shocks.  Retirement security in the United States varies sharply across class, race, and gender, with low-income workers, women, and people of color facing the greatest risks. Yet, despite these disparities, survey after survey confirms that retirement insecurity is a central economic concern for American families across the board.  Because Americans vote, this shared anxiety makes retirement security a top policy issue. Importantly, these concerns have been consistently voiced even before the recent financial shocks. The 2024 Retirement Insecurity report by Greenwald Research found that 79 percent of Americans believe the nation is facing a retirement crisis, a significant increase from 67 percent in 2020. Additional surveys compiled by the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis shows that between 32% and 71% of Americans express anxiety about their retirement prospects—underscoring the persistent uncertainty many feel about their financial futures.   And these levels of anxiety had been measured before the crash in the stock market in April 2025, which made anxiety even worse.  While the wealthy and economically-secure report less concern, rising wealth inequality—effectively, security inequality—could represent a political vulnerability for the Trump administration as it pursues tax cuts for the rich and deregulation of financial markets. But while the crisis is clear, so are the solutions. Expanding Social Security is the most practical, immediate, and popular step we can take. More than half of older Americans rely on Social Security for the majority of their income. For 25% of seniors, it provides 90% or more, notes the Center on Budget Priorities. Yet the median benefit—around $1,976/month as of January 2025—is not enough to cover basic expenses in most parts of the country, notes the Social Security Administration.  To shore up and expand the program, lawmakers have introduced bold plans. Representative John Larson’s \"Social Security 2100 Act\" and Senator Bernie Sanders’ \"Social Security Expansion Act\" both aim to raise revenue by: - Lifting the cap on taxable earnings (currently $168,600)- Applying payroll taxes to capital gains and other investment income- Providing a 2% across-the-board benefit increase One approach that is gaining traction is the \"donut hole\" method: income is taxed up to $168,600, then exempted until $400,000, and taxed again above that. This strikes a balance between revenue generation and political feasibility. According to the Social Security Administration’s Office of the Chief Actuary, Larson’s bill would close nearly 90% of the 75-year funding shortfall. Expanding Social Security isn’t a fringe idea. I’ve long argued that we could offer a 75% to 80% wage replacement rate for most workers (those earning between $10,000 and $80,000) with modest payroll tax increases shared between employers and employees.  But we can’t stop there. We must address the structural unfairness in how retirement is funded. Today, payroll taxes are levied only on wages. But the wealthy derive most of their income from capital—stocks, dividends, real estate. As long as these income streams go untaxed by Social Security, the system remains regressive. Applying the FICA to investment income would provide significant new revenue, reduce the burden on low- and middle-income earners, restore faith that the system is fair. And, of course, we must make the tax expenditures for retirement savings more fair and adopt a universal retirement account system for all Americans – the RSAA.  The Retirement Savings for Americans Act (RSAA) is a proposal in Congress to make the U.S. retirement system more equitable by establishing a universal retirement account system accessible to all American workers. An American workers who doesn’t have a plan at work would be automatically enrolled and will 3% of their pay into their account. (of course they can adjust the rate or opt out). Low income workers would get a a 5% federal match which helps right wrong of the top heavy current tax expenditures. The RSAA facilitates long-term wealth accumulation and financial security for a broader segment of the population. So here we are. America’s richest have never been richer. And most Americans are scared stiff they won’t be able to retire. It’s not hard to see why the pitchfork metaphor resonates. Fixing Social Security won’t solve everything. But it’s a smart and humane first step. A broad expansion of benefits, funded by fairer contributions from those who’ve benefited most, can ease widespread anxiety, restore trust in government, and begin to close the yawning wealth gap before it swallows our democracy whole. The pitchforks are real. But so are the policy tools to keep them in the barn. ",

        "domain": "theguardian.com",
        "text": "Report finds that wealth divide widened in Silicon Valley at double the rate of the whole US over the past decade Economic inequality has reached a staggering milestone in Silicon Valley: just nine households hold 15% of the region’s wealth, according to new research from San Jose State University. A mere 0.1% of residents hold 71% of the tech hub’s wealth. The findings come from the 2025 “Silicon Valley Pain Index”, a report published by SJSU’s Human Rights Institute each year since 2020. The report aims to quantify “structured inequalities” in Silicon Valley, and measures “pain” as “both personal and community distress or suffering”. This year’s index reports that the wealth divide has widened in Silicon Valley at double the rate of the whole United States over the past decade. The nine wealthiest households in the valley control $683.2bn – a $136bn increase over the past year. At the same time, 110,000 households reported nearly none or no assets. The cost of living in Silicon Valley has risen as well: renters must earn $136,532 to afford an apartment – the highest in the nation. The report ranked San Jose No 4 in “impossibly unaffordable” cities worldwide (after Hong Kong, Sydney and Vancouver). Yet, no cities in Silicon Valley have raised the minimum wage in the past three years. The report finds that 54,582 low-income households do not have access to an affordable home in San Jose and that homelessness grew 8.2% from 2023. When they created the Silicon Valley Pain Index in 2020, shortly after the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, San Jose State University researchers were inspired by the Katrina Pain Index, which aimed to quantify the injustices New Orleans residents faced after Hurricane Katrina. The index continues to show stark racial inequalities. Hispanic workers in San Jose, Sunnyvale and Santa Clara can expect to make 33 cents for every $1 their white peers take home. And although shareholders have voiced commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion, only 3% of employees working in research and development at Apple are Black (compared with 6% Hispanic/Latino, 36% white and 50% Asian). Meanwhile, police violence remains a real concern – even years after the Black Lives Matter protests. Ten people died in police custody in the Santa Clara county sheriff’s office in 2024 – the highest in two decades. And San Jose reported five office involved shootings, up three from 2023. However, the report did note certain improvements in the Silicon Valley area – including a decrease in police use of force incidents in San Jose, an expansion in services to prevent homelessness and environmental sustainability programs.

        "domain": "npr.org",
        "text": "\n\n      Greg Rosalsky\n    \n This past weekend, Planet Money traveled to San Francisco to attend the annual meeting of the American Economic Association (as well as other economic associations). It's the biggest professional event for American economists. Econ nerds met, networked, tried to get jobs, shared ideas, and presented hundreds of academic papers. By far, the hottest topic at this year's conference was artificial intelligence. The studies presented at the conference suggested that the big AI job massacre is not happening (at least not yet), that AI seems more likely to help workers become more productive rather than outright replace them (at least in most industries), and that AI's ultimate effects on inequality are still a mystery. AI wasn't just a big theme within the walls of the conference. Driving over the Bay Bridge into the city, billboard after billboard advertised AI products and services. An endless stream of Waymo driverless taxis now whiz around the city. In fact, a group of us took one this weekend, each for the first time. It was mind-boggling. Sitting in the backseat, watching the car turn and move with no one in the driver's seat — it felt like the future was already here. All the hubbub about AI made Stanford economist and friend of Planet Money Erik Brynjolfsson one of the busiest people at the conference this year. Brynjolfsson is the director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab and one of the most prolific scholars of the economics of technology. Brynjolfsson spent the weekend moderating a bunch of panels, participating in talks and lunches, answering questions, and taking pictures with fans like he was a moviestar. In fact, after he agreed to let me interview him following a panel discussion, I had to wait as a line of conference-goers formed in front of him, each wanting pictures and/or a few minutes of his time. \"The American Economic Association is, in a way, being taken over by AI just like every other industry and occupation,\" Brynjolfsson told me, after he could finally sit down for an interview. \"People are using AI in their research and they're studying it — and it's a sea change compared to what it was a few years ago.\" Fresh in my mind was Planet Money's ride in a driverless taxi. The drive went smoothly for us (unlike a recent passenger who got trapped in a circling Waymo on the way to the airport and missed his flight). Despite some problems with driverless cars, it seems pretty clear that taxi drivers and other people who drive for a living have a real reason to fear for their jobs — and maybe very soon. Meanwhile, many other workers worry that ChatGPT and other \"Generative AI\" tools will come for their jobs — although, perhaps unlike with autonomous vehicles, there are reasons to believe that fears about Generative AI killing office jobs and other jobs are overblown. Many of the predictions about AI killing jobs have — at least so far — failed to materialize. For example, AI godfather Geoffrey Hinton, who shared the Nobel Prize in physics this year for his work in this area, declared back in 2016 that \"people should stop training radiologists now\" because it was \"completely obvious\" that AI would outperform them in reading images within five years. That was over eight years ago — and not only are radiologists still around — but Brynjolfsson says that jobs for radiologists are actually growing. Hinton, Brynjolfsson says, was \"right about the systems becoming very, very good. But as it turns out, we actually have more demand for radiologists now than we did in 2016.\" The big reason, Brynjolfsson says, is that radiologists do a lot more than just analyze medical images. \"According to my research, they do about 27 distinct different tasks. One of them is reading medical images, but they also would do a lot of other things, including consulting doctors and patients. These are things that you wouldn't want a machine to be doing to people, and that's the way it is in almost every job in the economy.\" Prognosticators predicted that jobs for language translators and interpreters would also be quickly eliminated as AI proved to do the job better and faster. But as we've reported in the Planet Money newsletter, translator and interpreter jobs also appear to still be growing. Almost every job is really a bundle of many different tasks. AI may help or completely automate some of them, but, Brynjolfsson says, it can \"almost never\" do all of them. \"If it did, then you would actually have the elimination of the whole job. But in most cases, there are parts of the job that humans do better. And I think as we design the systems, we have to bear that in mind, that we want to have systems where humans and the machine work together to create better outcomes rather than assuming that the machine can do everything.\" Brynjolfsson says that his big takeaway from the papers presented at the economics conference this year was that AI is not just killing human jobs. \"A lot of people are concerned about AI and jobs,\" Brynjolfsson says. \"But I think one of the big themes has been that AI has been complementing workers as much or more than it's been substituting for workers. For the non-economists in your audience, if you substitute for something, you replace it and make it less valuable. But if you complement it, you make it more valuable. And, whether it's radiologists and other kinds of doctors or call center operators or lawyers, economists are finding that many workers are doing their jobs better with the help of AI, they're able to serve more customers, and demand [for their human labor] is actually up.\" In other words, AI — or, at least, this generation of Generative AI — is proving not to be a menace to the jobs of most or all workers. In fact, if anything, Generative AI seems to be helping humans get better at their jobs. That said, just because AI can't do whole jobs doesn't mean that partial automation of them won't have negative effects for workers. Adoption of AI may, for example, make jobs less satisfying, lower skilled or lower paid, and so on. Also, after taking a ride in a Waymo, I have to say that driverless vehicles (which are not powered by Generative AI) seem to be an imminent threat to the livelihoods of many people who currently drive for a living. One of the big questions in economics right now is which types of workers benefit from the use of AI and which ones don't. As we've covered before in the Planet Money newsletter, some early studies on Generative AI have found that less skilled, lower-performing workers have benefited more than higher skilled, higher-performing workers. For economists like MIT's David Autor, these early studies have been exciting. Top-tier economics research has found that, for decades, technology has mostly benefited workers at the top and not workers on the bottom. It's a big reason why economists believe income inequality has widened in recent decades. If AI is doing something different — complementing those on the bottom and not doing much or even hurting workers at the top — it might prove to help reduce inequality and, with the right policies in place, maybe even help rebuild the middle class. Brynjolfsson himself has published studies that find that lower-skilled workers benefit more from use of Generative AI than higher-skilled workers. \"I'd say the preponderance of the evidence right now are examples where AI does complement workers, especially less skilled workers, and that could, you know, potentially close some of the income inequality,\" Brynjolfsson says. \"In fact, overall income inequality has declined the past few years, although not necessarily just because of AI. But the technology is not the same as what we had 10 or 20 years ago.\" However, the latest incoming empirical evidence is mixed. Like personal computers and the internet before it, AI may ultimately increase inequality. At the conference, I saw one working paper presented that suggested that AI may increase inequality by making already successful entrepreneurs even more successful. The paper is called, \"The Uneven Impact of Generative AI on Entrepreneurial Performance,\" and it's by a team of five economists from UC Berkeley and Harvard Business School. The economists conducted a randomized controlled trial of entrepreneurs in Kenya. They gave entrepreneurs access to an AI mentor (powered by GPT-4), which provided business advice. The economists found that \"high performers benefited by just over 20% from AI advice, whereas low performers did roughly 10% worse with AI assistance.\" The study suggests that high-performing entrepreneurs had the judgement to ask the AI good questions and find actionable and profitable strategies to make their businesses better. Low-performing entrepreneurs, on the other hand, asked for advice \"on particularly challenging problems\" and didn't have the judgment to figure out which AI advice would actually be helpful to them. The result was that the use of AI hurt their performance. In short, AI seemed to increase inequality amongst this group of entrepreneurs. Another recent study by MIT economist Aidan Toner-Rodgers found something similar. It looked at what happened to the productivity of over a thousand scientists at an R&D lab of a large company after they got access to AI. Toner-Rodgers found that \"while the bottom third of scientists see little benefit, the output of top researchers nearly doubles.\" Again, AI benefits those who can figure out how to use it well, and, it suggests, that in many fields, top performers could become more top performing, thereby increasing inequality. \"So there's evidence in both different directions,\" Brynjolfsson says. But, Brynjolfsson stresses, how AI affects inequality or any other important economic outcome isn't a given. \"We have choices about how we design our systems.\" With the right design of AI systems (and also public policies), Brynjolfsson says, AI might be able to usher in more widely shared prosperity. \"And one of my pleas to business managers and to technologists is to think harder about using AI to augment humans and to benefit humanity more broadly rather than have all of the benefits accrued to a very small group.\" Walking around this year's economics conference, I found myself wondering what was going on during this annual conference back in the mid-to-late 1990s, when the internet was taking off. What were economists saying back then? Were their insights and predictions correct? Did they see that, while the internet would transform the economy, they were also in the middle of a dotcom bubble that would soon pop? Are we in the middle of a similar bubble, and economists aren't focusing enough on it? Sure, Brynjolfsson says, there may be some overhyped AI companies or applications that don't bear fruit. But, he says, \"I'm pretty sure AI is going to have a bigger effect on the economy than the internet. And the internet was pretty big.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

        "text": "The top 10% of wealthy Americans now control 60% of the nation’s wealth, while the poorer half of the country holds only 6%, according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office.  Left-leaning think tanks produce regular updates on growing wealth inequality in America. This analysis, though, comes from a nonpartisan federal agency, one whose findings regularly inconvenience both Democrats and Republicans.  The new report, released this month, illustrates the role of Social Security in shoring up the wealth of middle-class and working-class Americans. If you subtract Social Security from the equation, the top 10% control nearly 70% of the nation’s wealth, and the bottom half holds only 3%.  “For 90% of households, Social Security is the most important thing in their portfolio,” said Monique Morrissey, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. “And any cuts to Social Security, therefore, would have a huge impact.”  The Social Security fund is projected to run short in about 10 years. Both leading presidential candidates have pledged to protect it.   Democrats in Congress accuse Republicans of seeking to cut Social Security benefits by raising the retirement age. Republicans counter that President Joe Biden has imperiled the program with reckless overspending.   Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Democrat, said he requested the budget office analysis to highlight wealth disparities, and to show how much Social Security matters to lower-income Americans. Whitehouse chairs the Senate Budget Committee.  \"As this CBO report shows, the top 1% of families now control more than four times the wealth of the entire bottom half,\" Whitehouse said in a statement to USA TODAY. Presidential candidate Kamala Harris proposes to protect Social Security “by making millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share in taxes,” according to campaign documents.   Democrats propose to reap new revenue by raising tax rates on the wealthiest Americans and corporations, and by going after wealthy tax cheats.   The Republican platform for 2024 includes a pledge to “fight for and protect Social Security and Medicare with no cuts, including no changes to the retirement age.” Candidate Donald Trump has reasoned that economic growth and job creation would naturally boost payroll tax revenue and support Social Security.   The new report finds that the overall wealth held by American households nearly quadrupled from 1989 to 2022, from $52 trillion to $199 trillion, after adjusting for inflation. The figures come from the federal Survey of Consumer Finances.   The budget office has calculated wealth disparities before, but the new report is the first to include projected Social Security benefits.   All told, Social Security accounts for about 20% of America’s wealth, the report found. But the benefits are much more important to lower-income households.   Social Security benefits account for roughly half of the wealth of Americans in the bottom 25%, the analysis found, but for only 8% of the wealth of the top 10%.  The report found wealth inequality on the rise, even when you factor in Social Security:  The analysis “is stating the obvious, that wealth in the United States is concentrated, and getting more so,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “This has been in the makings, really, for two generations, maybe three. And the trend lines are disconcerting.”  Yet, the budget office report also shows that the poorest Americans have grown wealthier along with the wealthiest.  In fact, family wealth increased most rapidly from 1989 to 2022 among some of the least affluent households.   Family wealth rose by 232% in those years for Americans at the 25th percentile, meaning that three-quarters of households were wealthier. In the same span, family wealth grew by 148% for households at the 90th percentile.  “The question, fundamentally, is, are living standards improving over time? And the answer is yes,” said Kyle Pomerleau, a senior fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.  The wealth analysis draws from the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finance, which found that household wealth in America swelled at a record pace during the pandemic. From 2019 to 2022, the median net worth of U.S. families grew 37% to $192,900, after inflation, the largest rise in the history of the survey. Wealth rose at all income levels.  “Widespread economic growth that is shared broadly in the population is a good thing,” said Owen Zidar, a Princeton University economist.  Most Americans believe there is too much economic inequality in America, according to a 2020 report from Pew Research. More than half of Americans also believe rich people and corporations don’t pay their fair share of taxes.   But the concentration of wealth is also the story of successful entrepreneurship in America, the rise of prosperous companies and innovative products, Pomerleau said, “and that’s something that we should foster in the United States.” Whitehouse, the senator who requested the report, is using the findings to argue for higher tax rates on the wealthiest Americans, echoing the Harris platform.   In 2017, then-President Trump signed legislation that lowered taxes across all income groups, with wealthier taxpayers benefiting the most, according to the nonprofit PolitiFact. Those cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025.  \"Our corrupted tax code has helped enable a few ultra-rich individuals to capture for themselves more than a quarter of our nation’s wealth, undermining the American middle class and hollowing out local communities,\" Whitehouse said. Trump has said he will extend the cuts if voters reelect him. Harris has pledged to extend most of the cuts but to raise tax rates on the very wealthiest Americans and on wealthy corporations.   Some economists have urged both parties to consider even steeper taxes. In one recent analysis, researchers found that the government could raise $1.8 trillion over a decade by restoring the higher tax rates of 1997.  “It would raise trillions and bring the tax code back to an era of fiscal responsibility and strong economic growth,” said Zidar, who joined in the research.  Pomerleau, at the American Enterprise Institute, concurs that taxing the wealthy could raise money and shore up Social Security – to a point.  “There’s only so much money you can get from high-income households,” he said. ",

        "domain": "slate.com",
        "text": "This story was supported by the journalism nonprofit the Economic Hardship Reporting Project. The first time I met a rich person, I was 15. I’d just arrived at boarding school on scholarship after time in foster care. My new roommate—let’s call her Jane—had transferred from a top-ranked public high school that educated Silicon Valley’s heirs. I grew up with an anguish that came from low expectations, while Jane suffered from the stress of never being good enough. In our tiny, cell-like dorm room, I learned that despite our opposite upbringings, we had a lot in common. We both loved calculus and hated our nosy RA, and we were both miserable. And we both coped in ways that have now become ubiquitous among America’s youth. I cut myself, abused Adderall, and made myself throw up in our dorm’s bathroom. Jane grappled with overwhelming anxiety, distorted body image, and social media addiction. Even our emotional torment seemed to have a common origin: economic inequality. In America, the gap between haves and have-nots is enormous, and has been widening for years. What’s less well-known is the growing body of evidence, summarized this month in a Lancet report, suggesting that inequality harms us psychologically and physically, no matter our tax bracket or the size of our house. It makes status hypersalient, weakens social ties, and encourages us to choose prestige over purpose. As inequality rises in lockstep with measures of psychic distress among teens, we need to consider its role if we want to keep kids from suffering needlessly, falling short of their potential, and, increasingly, dying before they reach adulthood. This problem, which defined my teenage experience, has become particularly urgent to me as a new parent. I don’t want to raise my daughter in a culture where well-meaning parents push their progeny to the brink, where it increasingly feels like the only two options are amassing enormous wealth at all costs or suffering through a life of penury. Sociologists and demographers have long recognized a relationship between poverty and illness, but inequality itself seems to contribute to negative outcomes—for rich and poor alike. In her book The Spirit Level, epidemiologist Kate Pickett found that less egalitarian nations had three times the rate of mental illness of more egalitarian countries, and that even wealthier citizens in those unequal places were vulnerable. Inequality, Pickett told me, “affects everyone in a society. We’re all exposed to it.” By making social status increasingly important, inequality spurs people to incessantly compare themselves to others, a source of constant stress that wears us down and, in turn, makes it hard to trust, eroding the social bonds that protect against despair. Many researchers who track health trends see the 1980s as a turning point in American mental health. During the Reagan years, the rich began getting much richer while average wages flatlined. Soon, rates of emotional disturbance ticked upward rapidly, while trust in other people began to fall. U.S. life expectancy began trailing that of peer countries. Today, the situation is even more dismal: American life expectancy has fallen for five straight years, and is at its lowest rate in almost 20 years. More children and teenagers are dying, too, many by gun violence, overdose, and suicide: 1 in 25 American kindergarteners won’t live to age 40. This is unprecedented for a rich country in the modern era. The Lancet report, crafted by more than 50 people over five years, points to inequality-increasing economic policies as a key reason why people’s mental health is suffering. To me, this is personal: As a working-class teen from the Midwest coming of age during the Great Recession, hopelessness consumed me. Financial instability weakened my parents’ marriage; the ensuing divorce buried my mom in debt and left her on the hook for raising me alone. Union jobs, like my mom’s, were disappearing. She lived in fear of getting laid off, which fueled her compulsive shopping and hoarding until we lived in squalor. I grew depressed and eventually spent time in a locked residential psychiatric treatment center and foster care. When I tried to kill myself at 13, it was because I saw no future. My family wasn’t even the worst off. We never fell into dire poverty, and we were white, so we never faced racism. But I was tormented by the sense that a shimmering paradise existed somewhere, just out of reach. The internet taught me that in other, fancier places, people ate salads instead of McDonald’s, practiced Pilates instead of clearance-shopped, and pronounced bagel “bay-gull.” Those sophisticates had easier problems and brighter futures. Whether or not I could enter their idyll depended on navigating an obstacle course where one wrong move would consign me to flyover land forever. It turns out that my high school roommate Jane was as terrified of downward mobility as I was. For her, staying in the one percent required earning straight As, getting into an elite university to study math or computer science, and then landing a job at one of a handful of blue-chip companies. Yes, her parents could help, but that prospect brought shame. Money hadn’t been enough to save a close family member from psychiatric crisis— nor to protect Jane from the fallout. While only catastrophe would plunge Jane into privation, she’d have to fight to maintain the comfort of her youth and, like me, doubted she would succeed. In a country with a meager welfare system, where net worth often translates into self-worth, anything less than affluence felt like a terrifying drop into the abyss. Jane’s parents felt this fear, too, leading them to parent in ways that may have worsened their daughter’s anxiety. Even in one of America’s safest towns, 18-year-old Jane was rarely allowed outside alone when she was home from school. Of course, in a highly unequal society, hypervigilance makes economic sense as a way to prevent kids from falling behind. “Across countries, the intensity of parenting lines up very closely with economic inequality,” economist Matthias Doepke, co-author of Love, Money, and Parenting, has said. In egalitarian Denmark, kindergarteners routinely play with axes; Swedish elementary schoolers are encouraged to build fires. In stark contrast, Illinois parents can’t leave 13-year-olds home alone without risking neglect charges. As America has become more unequal, parents of all incomes helicopter more. This increased parental guidance may help youngsters academically, but the lack of autonomy takes a psychological toll: Many experts believe intensive parenting is one of the most important causes of adolescent distress. But even those on the top rung of the economic ladder suffer from inequality. Clay Cockrell, a therapist to ultra-high-net-worth individuals in Manhattan, told me, “Money at this level is toxic and dangerous. People die of this.” When you have so much more than others, it’s hard to tell whom you can trust, leading to loneliness and paranoia. Studies suggest that upper-middle-class Americans exhibit less compassion and empathy compared to those with fewer means—emotions that are crucial for creating the bonds that sustain us. Enormous wealth engenders a sense of competition between the generations, Cockrell said, intimidating children who fear they will never emulate their parents’ success. Given all the evidence that inequality harms our well-being, why have discussions about mental health ignored this scourge? One reason: The every-man-for-himself principles that fuel inequality also frame health as a purely personal issue—a problem that should be addressed with individual interventions like medication and therapy, rather than policy change. Now that I’m in my early 30s and a new parent, my circumstances are closer to Jane’s than those of my family of origin. Jane got into music school but decided to major in math; after a few years of finding herself, she became a data scientist in San Francisco. Meanwhile, aware that any old Ivy League degree wasn’t enough to ensure my stability, I studied computer science. I worked as a software engineer at Google and Meta, married a fellow Harvard-trained engineer with generational wealth, and bought an apartment in Manhattan. But I’m still terrified for myself and for my child. There’s only so much I can do to shield my daughter from capitalism’s vicious reality. My child will face pressure to excel at all costs—if not from me, then from the winner-take-all economy. She will grapple with what it means to live in comfort while many more go without. They will wonder if they’re next on the chopping block, fated to fall through a nonexistent safety net. Mental illness isn’t just an emotional problem—it’s an economic one. As the population ages, America relies on an ever-smaller pool of young workers to support the elderly. Debilitating psychiatric disorders make it hard to get an education or hold down a job, creating a dire threat to society as diagnoses rise. Individual solutions like therapy and medication alone will never solve the mental health crisis. We also need to target inequality and the policies that foster it. While few people think about tax codes as public health measures, removing loopholes to increase tax revenue and expanding child tax credits—a move supported by both presidential candidates in the 2024 election—can and do address rates of mental illness. And these changes are popular. In a 2021 poll, two-thirds of Americans said the government should pursue policies to reduce the wealth gap; even a majority of young Republicans concurred. Instead of bemoaning modern parenting trends, we need to look at the factors that push caregivers to helicopter—and that make kids status-obsessed, materialistic, and sick with worry. Therapists can play a role by talking frankly about class and money, long taboo topics in the treatment room. In our dorm room late at night, Jane and I agonized about our futures. Lying below me in our bunk, she grappled with the petrifying freedom that her family’s money gave her. I feared what would happen if I couldn’t pay for college or find a job that offered health insurance. At 17 and 18 years old, we didn’t have the answers. We were stuck in a world we had not created: Like any other inheritance, it was ours.  Slate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

        "title": "Extreme inequality was the preexisting condition': How COVID-19 widened America's wealth gap",
        "domain": "abcnews.go.com",
        "text": "As 45 million Americans lost their jobs, U.S. billionaires made $584 billion. The novel coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated income inequality, experts say, stretching the racial wealth gap in the United States and making the richest wealthier while leaving many of the poorest without jobs. As the COVID-19 pandemic overtook the U.S., it brought with it an unprecedented financial crisis and unemployment rates at their highest levels since the Great Depression, especially among Black, Hispanic and Asian workers (16.8%, 17.6% and 15% in May compared to 12.4% for whites). At least 45 million people have filed for unemployment since the pandemic began. Yet between March 18 and June 17, as the pandemic raged, the combined wealth of the 614 U.S. billionaires increased by $584 billion, according to an analysis released late last week by the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank based in Washington, D.C. The researchers calculated the billionaires' wealth gains based on real-time data from Forbes. Experts said the wealth of the richest Americans is tied more closely than the rest of America to the stock market, which crashed at the onset of the crisis but has rallied since -- largely detached from the broader economic picture. \"The pandemic crisis will widen the already worrisome levels of income, racial, and gender inequality in the U.S,\" Dimitri Papadimitriou, President of the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College, and former Greek Minister of Economy and Development, told ABC News. \"This engenders an element of a vicious circle at work: not only will the pandemic and its fallout worsen inequality; inequality will exacerbate the spread of the virus, not to mention undermine any ensuing economic recovery efforts.\" Data has shown that the virus has disproportionately affected Blacks and Latinos, who each have hospitalization rates 4.5 times that of non-Hispanic whites, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Communities of color are also overrepresented among essential workers who are generally unable to work from home and more likely to come into contact with the virus. \"Even though most people would assert that a disease or other disaster is blind to differences of race, creed or wealth, we are not ‘all in this pandemic together,'\" Papadimitrou added. \"This assumption that 'we are together' distracts us from the socio-economic dimensions of the COVID-19 crisis.\" Chuck Collins, the co-author of the analysis and the director of the program on inequality at the Institute for Policy Studies told ABC News that their findings are \"a reflection of this extremely unequal time that we are living in and it's not that simple, it's really 40 years of accumulating, accelerating inequality.\" As the U.S. entered the pandemic, \"in some ways the extreme inequality was the preexisting condition,\" Collins said. The impact of income inequality during a pandemic isn’t just linked to economic hardship -- it can also be deadly. A team of researchers from the London School of Economics U.S. Centre argued in a May analysis that \"states with greater income inequality are more likely to report more COVID-19 cases and fatalities.\" \"The effect of inequality is large -- it is tied with the Human Development Index as the second strongest predictor of Covid deaths in various states,” Harold Clarke, a professor of economics at University of Texas at Dallas and Paul Whitely, a professor at the University of Essex, wrote in their findings. The researchers measured inequality using the Gini Index, an economic barometer that ranks income inequality from 0 (total inequality) to 1 (total equality) and found that it was a strong predictor of COVID-19 deaths. New York, which had one of the highest Gini Index numbers at .52 also had the highest number of fatalities in the nation by a margin. But excluding New York and New Jersey, the researchers found that inequality was still a strong predictor. \"The U.S. so far has had the most deaths of any country,\" Dr. Mary Bassett, the director of the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at the Harvard T.H. Chan School, told ABC News. \"In the U.S., these track along racial lines, and you'll hear the phrase racial capitalism now being raised by protesters that the kind of economy that the United States developed was not only a capitalist economy but one that was kick-started by its reliance on slave labor.\" \"We see that reflected in the present day,” Bassett said. \"To be black or Latino or Native American in the United States is to have a much higher risk of being poor.\" A Brookings Institute analysis found that in 2016, the typical white family had a net worth 10 times that of a Black family ($171,000 compared to $17,150). \"People’s income determines their everyday lives, which includes their ability to access health services -- that's always true, but COVID-19 broke down into stark relief,\" Bassett said. \"I would argue that a series of choices that have been made in the United States at the societal level meant that the U.S. was much more vulnerable to this pandemic.\" Papadimitriou added that \"a reduction in income inequality is one of the most important -- if not the single-most important -- structural changes that needs to be implemented so that the U.S. economy can return to a sustainable growth path in the medium run.\" A public policy brief written by several of Papadimitriou's colleagues at the Levy Economics Institute, concludes that \"had these issues been addressed already, the pandemic’s impacts on the United States would have been less severe.\" Michael Graetz, a professor at Columbia University and the author of the book \"The Wolf at the Door: The Menace of Economic Insecurity and How to Fight It,\" said some of the richest have seen their wealth grow during the pandemic in part because of how divorced the stock market can be from the real economy. \"Some stocks, the tech stocks in particular, have done extremely well during the pandemic and of course lots of shares of Facebook and Amazon and others are owned by billionaires so of course their wealth has gone up because their stock has gone up in value,\" he said. \"The bottom half of the American public doesn’t own stocks so they haven’t shared in those gains.\" The bottom 40% of earners, he added, have been hurt most by unemployment during the pandemic. \"So you have a situation where they’ve lost their wages and Congress has temporarily provided some extra unemployment benefits to some of those folks and then sent $1,200 dollar checks but for those people, the people at the bottom half of the income distribution, have been living a precarious life before the pandemic, Graetz said. Congress boosted unemployment benefits during the pandemic and opened relief up to freelancers and others generally not covered by unemployment insurance. But people had to wait weeks in some cases for benefits. Stimulus checks were also not issued on a sliding scale based on need (although married couples making over $198,000 were ineligible). Even before the pandemic, Graetz cited a 2018 Federal Reserve survey that found nearly 40% of American families said they couldn't cover an unexpected $400 expense. \"The pandemic has created emergencies that are much larger than $400,\" he said. Wealth inequality in the U.S. is intrinsically linked to the racial wealth gap, Valerie Wilson, the director of the program on race, ethnicity, and the economy at the Economic Policy Institute, told ABC News. \"If we’re seeing growth wealth inequality in general then it almost goes without question to say that the racial wealth gap is widening as well because a lot of the underlying racial disparities throughout the economy in wages, employment, income,” Wilson said. \"Part of getting to recovery has to do with addressing these holes that have been opened even more by the pandemic.\" Understanding the rampant inequalities that are being exacerbated during the crisis are crucial when policymakers look towards economic recovery efforts. \"The first thing is just how to make sure the current recovery programs and stimulus programs reduce the racial wealth divide, not make it worse,\" Collins told ABC News. One solution is the Democrat-backed HEROES Act, Collins said, which provides hazard pay to front-line workers among other relief as well as oversight of current funding. \"We’re spending trillions of dollars, let's not make the same mistakes that we did after the great recession of 2009 where we put in place policies that worsened the racial wealth gap,\" he added. \"It requires a certain intentional commitment to racial equity as part of the recovery.\" Bassett noted that \"$2 trillion [in the CARES Act] was mobilized to save Wall Street and large corporations\" which proves \"the U.S. can mobilize that kind of level of resource to protect people.\" \"But that would take a great deal of political courage and votes that currently don't exist,\" she added. Collins said data collection amid the pandemic is crucial, as are audits of how stimulus and government relief funds are being used. Finally, Collins noted the ultra-rich need to be paying their fair share of taxes. \"One of the reasons why our economy is so ill prepared, our public health system and our ability to respond to the pandemic, is because the very rich have seen their share of taxes continue to go down over the last three four decades, so we have to restore some progressivity to the tax code,\" he said. Papadimitrou said that policies combatting the epidemic and financial crisis must \"be sensitive to inequalities and to avoid exacerbating biases that increase social, gender, and racial gaps.\" \"If we ignore the regressive impact or refrain from taking action to mitigate these unequal harms will not only be an affront to principles of fairness, it will prolong the pandemic and worsen its severity,” he added. While people can feel powerless, Wilson noted there are many ways you can make your voice heard. \"Why I feel people still have a voice is because of the protests, those are connected to police brutality and violence against Black people,\" she said, but noted that many companies and even government agencies have responded to them. \"We’re tired of this, we want this to change, I think the same kind of attitude can be applied to so many kinds of injustices in this country.\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

However, it was significantly lower than the millionaire-making mean ‚Äî coming in at $192,900.\n     \n            The median is resistant to outliers, making it a more reliable measure than the mean, which can be skewed by extreme values.\n     \n            And while the median net worth has increased significantly, it‚Äôs still under $200,000 ‚Äî far short of the estimated amount Americans should have in retirement savings.\n     \n            The numbers become more drastic when broken into income brackets: The top 10% of wage earners (who have an average net worth of about $6.6 million) saw their incomes increase by about 22% between 2019 and 2022. Middle-income wage earners saw a 5% increase over the same period.\n     \n            There was ‚Äúsome increase in income inequality over this period,‚Äù said the Fed. Indeed it was one of the largest three-year increases in income inequality over the history of the modern survey, according to the Fed.\n     \n            That widening gulf between the haves and the have-nots could help explain why Americans are losing confidence about the economic outlook.\n     \n            For the third month in a row, the Conference Board‚Äôs Consumer Confidence Index fell ‚Äî dropping to 102.6 in October from an upwardly revised 104.3 in September. The index is at its second-lowest level this year, landing a hair above May‚Äôs 102.5 reading, according to Conference Board data released Tuesday.\n     \n            And high prices are making people feel worse. ‚ÄúConsumers continued to be preoccupied with rising prices in general, and for grocery and gasoline prices in particular,‚Äù Dana Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n     \n            Consumers with a household income between $25,000 to $35,000 saw the biggest decline in confidence about the economy over the past month. In contrast, consumers with a household income between $100,000 to $125,000 saw the biggest jump in confidence over the past month.\n     \nBridging the investment gap: That being said, the rise in retail investing has increased significantly since 2019, according to Fed data.\n     \n            The percentage of American families that own individual stocks and not just retirement funds is near record highs. Share ownership among Americans under 35, who traditionally don‚Äôt invest as much as their older counterparts, has hit a record high. As has investment from Black and Hispanic Americans.\n     \n            That means the economics of Wall Street, not just Main Street, have an increasing impact on the wallets of everyday Americans.\n     \n            In October, the Dow fell 1.4% and the S&P 500 slid 2.2%. Both indexes notched their first three-month streak of declines since March 2020. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.8%.\n     \n            Bud Light continues to drag on Anheuser-Busch InBev‚Äôs bottom line in the United States, reports my colleague Jordan Valinsky.\n     \n            AB InBev said that sales to US retailers declined nearly 17% ‚Äúprimarily due to the volume decline of Bud Light.‚Äù In response, the company cut deals with wholesalers,¬†including writing checks¬†to distributors, and¬†increasing marketing spend¬†on the brand. But that took a toll on the company‚Äôs bottom line, and contributed to a 29% decline in adjusted US earnings.\n     \n            Tuesday‚Äôs report painted a bleak picture for Bud Light, sales and shipments of which have¬†weakened dramatically¬†since its brief and limited partnership with trans influencer¬†Dylan Mulvaney¬†in the spring.\n     \n            In the summer, Bud Light lost its long-held¬†top-selling American beer title to rival Modelo.¬†The Constellation-owned brand has been making inroads in the US market for several years as customers switch their tastes to Mexican lagers.\n     \n            Sales of Bud Light are still sinking, with volumes down 30% year-over-year for the four weeks ending on October 7, according to NIQ data given to Beer Business Daily newsletter.\n     \n            In an effort to jumpstart sales, Bud Light has been rolling out marketing campaigns and partnerships it thinks will placate fans. The company has, for example, run ads featuring NFL players which include taglines like ‚Äúeasy to drink‚Äù and ‚Äúeasy to enjoy.‚Äù\n     \n            And last week, the UFC switched their beer sponsorship from Modelo to Bud Light in a¬†reportedly record-breaking deal¬†as part of AB‚Äôs revitalization efforts of the brand.\n     \n            While you were busy handing out candy to trick-or-treaters, Federal Reserve officials were doing something a lot less fun, most people would say.\n     \n            They were discussing the state of the economy and preparing for today‚Äôs big decision on interest rates.\n     \n            This time around, however, it doesn‚Äôt feel like such a big decision. That‚Äôs because the central bank is widely expected to hold interest rates steady for the second meeting in a row, reports my colleague Elisabeth Buchwald.\n     \n            It may seem a little strange given all the recent data that‚Äôs suggesting the economy has been fairly strong, but that‚Äôs because what may appear like good news for the economy isn‚Äôt necessarily that good.\n     \n            For instance, last week‚Äôs¬†gross domestic product report, which showed the economy grew at a remarkably strong pace in the third quarter, on the surface sounds like something worthy of celebrating. The Biden administration certainly did.\n     \n            But many economists‚Äô worried that the third-quarter GDP report shows the economy isn‚Äôt growing at a sustainable pace.\n     \n            In other words, the good times may not last very long before the party‚Äôs over and the economy wakes up with a big hangover.\n     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the Federal Reserve has gotten plenty of kudos for moves that have helped stabilize the economy, kept house prices from tanking and supported the stock market. But those successes have obscured another effect: the inadvertent impact the Fed’s ultra-low interest rates and bond-buying sprees are having on economic inequality. Longstanding inequality in the U.S. has been exacerbated by the Fed’s role in touching off a multitrillion-dollar boom in stock markets — and stock ownership is heavily skewed toward the wealthiest Americans. In contrast, soaring stock prices don’t help people like Wina Tan. Tan, 59, is one of the millions of Americans nearing retirement age whose greatest source of wealth isn’t stocks or equity in a home. Rather, it’s the Social Security checks she expects to start getting once she retires. Tan, precariously perched on the lowest rung of America’s working class, earns about $25,000 a year as a job coach for adults with special needs near Irvine, California. She’s a single mom and grandmother and can afford food, rent and healthcare only with the help of federal safety net programs. Her savings account totals around $11,000, most of it from recent tax refunds and stimulus payments. She’s reluctant to risk that money in stocks, so the bull market will probably continue to charge past her. Meanwhile, thanks to the Fed’s near-zero interest rates, the best rate her credit union could offer was 0.5% for a long-term certificate of deposit. That would mean earning less than $60 a year on her savings while tying the money up for five years. Tan’s situation is far from unique. Social Security is the top source of wealth for most lower-income households with workers nearing retirement, according to Teresa Ghilarducci, an economist at The New School in New York City who specializes in retirement. If the guaranteed income stream of Social Security is treated as an asset, she estimates it amounts to 58% of the net worth for near-retirees in the bottom half of the U.S. wealth distribution. Other retirement savings represent only about 11% of their net worth, and stocks are just 1%. (Home equity accounts for most of the remainder.) Large swaths of Americans like Tan have essentially missed out on any direct wealth increase from the market’s near doubling since its bottom 13 months ago. Rather, the major beneficiaries have been the wealthiest 10% of Americans, who owned 89% of stocks and mutual fund shares held by U.S. households as of year-end, according to Fed statistics. More than half of that — 53% — is owned by the top 1%. The Fed’s policies have helped generate jobs and reduce unemployment, which was their goal. In the process, however, the Fed has accelerated the decades-long increase in economic inequality by helping increase the wealth of people at the top far more than it has increased the wealth of working-class Americans. “High-wealth households do much better in a low-rate environment than lower-wealth households do,” Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said. “The low-interest environment increases inequality by increasing the wealth of people who are well off.” Zandi noted, however, that less well-off people don’t lose money because of the low rates; they simply don’t do as well as wealthier people. Home prices have also benefited from the Fed’s easy money policies, and home ownership is much more evenly distributed than stock ownership is. The wealthiest 10% own only 45% of the real estate held by American households, according to the Fed. The remainder is owned largely by middle-class households, for whom home equity is often their biggest source of wealth. But stock holdings are where the truly massive gains have come. It’s also where there was a big scare last year before the Fed and the CARES Act came to the rescue. COVID-19 sent unemployment soaring and stocks plummeting, as the market fell 35% from Feb. 19 to March 23, 2020. The market’s rise since then makes the increase in homeowners’ equity look negligible. From last year’s market bottom through mid-April of this year, stocks gained about $22.4 trillion in value, as measured by the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index. The value of U.S. stocks was growing faster than home equity before last year, but the gap exploded after actions by the Federal Reserve stabilized the markets. In contrast, the nation’s total home equity — the value of houses less the debt on them — rose only about $1.3 trillion from the end of last year’s first quarter (eight days after the market low) through Dec. 31, according to the Fed. Even if you tweak the housing numbers to reflect this year’s gains, or measure the stock market’s gain from before the February drop, the disparity between stocks and home equity is huge. “Inequality is a cumulative process,” said Karen Petrou, author of “The Engine of Inequality: The Fed and the Future of Wealth in America” and managing partner of the Washington-based consulting firm Federal Financial Analytics. “The richer you are, the richer you get, and the poorer you are, the poorer you get, unless something puts that engine in reverse,” she said. “That engine is driven not by fate or by untouchable phenomena such as demographics but most importantly by policy decisions.” Under President Joe Biden, the federal government is trying to both create jobs and funnel lots of money to people like Tan with the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan stimulus package. Indeed, Tan is grateful for the $4,200 in stimulus funds she recently received. “This country has really, really blessed me a lot,” said Tan, a naturalized citizen who emigrated from Indonesia in 1984. The Biden administration is also pushing for a $2.3 trillion infrastructure bill. But even without a penny yet having been spent on that, the federal government is running up record budget deficits, with more to come. A considerable part of current and future deficits will be indirectly financed by the Fed, which has been increasing its holdings of Treasury IOUs and mortgage-backed securities by at least $120 billion a month, and has directed its trading desk to increase purchases “as needed” to maintain smooth functioning in the financial markets. During Donald Trump’s four years as president, the Fed added $2.25 trillion to its holdings of Treasury IOUs, which helped cover the $7.8 trillion of debt the Treasury issued to finance budget deficits during the Trump years. It’s likely the central bank will be the biggest source of finance for Biden’s deficits, just as it was for Trump’s. Why does that matter? Because when the Fed buys securities, it does so with money that it creates out of thin air. Pumping more money into the financial system increases the money supply, and some of that cash inevitably ends up making its way into the stock market, boosting prices. Biden is making tax increases a big part of his infrastructure pitch, which in theory would make that legislation less reliant on the Fed. But it doesn’t mean taxes will go up anywhere near as much as he’s proposing. Or that taxes and spending will rise in lockstep. After all, spending is a lot more popular than raising taxes. Now, let’s step back a bit and see how we got to this point. During the 2008-09 financial crisis, the Fed initiated “quantitative easing,” a policy under which the central bank buys massive amounts of Treasury IOUs and other securities to inject money into the markets and stimulate the economy. Then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke championed that approach, which complemented aggressive moves by the Treasury and helped keep giant banks and the world financial system from cratering. (Lots of people still lost their homes to foreclosure, another example of how helping the financial system might not help average people. But that story has already been told.) Quantitative easing helps stimulate the economy by driving down interest rates, which hurts savers. A telling indicator involves money market mutual funds, where savers have traditionally tucked away spare cash in hopes of earning more interest than bank deposits pay. Money market funds used to produce much more income than stock market index funds. But that ratio began to slip in 2008 and has kept on slipping. At the end of 2007, Vanguard’s federal money market fund was yielding 4.46% and dividends on the Admiral shares of its Total Stock Market index fund yielded 1.78%. (A dividend yield is a fund’s annual dividend divided by its share price.) At the end of 2008, the yield was 1.74% for the money market fund and 2.82% for the stock index fund. The current numbers: 0.01% and 1.28%. Such low rates have forced average savers to either get by with less interest income or put more money into stocks than they would have otherwise done. That added demand has been one of the factors that has helped push stock prices upward. Economists are beginning to view the interplay of the Fed’s actions and inequality in a new light. Central bankers used to think that “we didn’t have to worry about inequality when we did monetary policy,” Olivier Blanchard, former director of research for the International Monetary Fund, said during a December virtual forum sponsored by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Blanchard said he has since come to believe that monetary policy does impact economic inequality because a change in interest rates has “major, major distribution effects between borrowers and lenders, between asset holders and not.” Spokespeople for the Fed, the Treasury and the White House declined to discuss the impact of soaring stock prices spurred by ultra-low interest rates on economic inequality. So we looked at what some key people involved in the 2008-09 and 2020 Fed bailouts have said publicly. Fed chair Jerome Powell hasn’t directly addressed the central bank’s role in exacerbating inequality, though he has expressed sympathy for people left behind during the economic comeback. (“There’s a lot of suffering out there still,” he told “60 Minutes” in an interview that aired on April 11. “And I think it’s important that, just as a country, we stay and help those people.”) In a congressional hearing in February, Powell testified, “We can’t affect wealth inequality. … We can affect indirectly income inequality by doing what we can to support job creation at the lower end of the market.” When pressed to discuss problems of wealth inequality by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), he told her that “those are really fiscal policy issues.” Bernanke, currently a fellow at the Brookings Institution, acknowledged in a 2017 Brookings paper that “all else equal, higher stock prices mean greater inequality of wealth.” But he maintained that “whatever effects monetary policy has on inequality are likely to be transient, in contrast to the secular forces of technology and globalization that have contributed to the multi-decade rise in inequality in the United States and some other advanced economies.” Like Powell, Bernanke argued that inequality is the purview of fiscal policymakers (Congress and the White House) rather than the Fed. Janet Yellen, who was the Fed’s vice chair under Bernanke and is now Treasury secretary, asked in a 2014 speech whether income inequality is “compatible with values rooted in our nation’s history.” But she largely defended ultra-low rates during a Q&A at a 2013 conference of business journalists. Older savers were “suffering from low returns on their CDs,” she said, but “they have children and they have grandchildren” who will benefit from the stronger economy. However, the economic effects of quantitative easing eventually fade, according to researchers at the Bank for International Settlements, a Switzerland-based institution that acts as a central bank for central banks. The BIS concluded in a 2017 study that quantitative easing had more success boosting stock prices than boosting economic growth. Over time, the economic impact trended toward zero while stocks saw a “significant and persistent positive impact,” the researchers found. Jason Furman, a former chair of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers and currently an economics professor at Harvard, summed up the inequality tradeoff this way in an interview: “I don’t want to have a lower stock market and higher unemployment.” In other words, increasing wealth for the wealthy is an inevitable side effect of keeping interest rates low to support the economy and create jobs. The latest round of stimulus checks will help close that gap a little by putting money in the pockets of low-income earners like Tan. But near-zero interest rates will make it harder for them to save the money for the future, as Tan hopes to do. She would like to set aside $1,000 to $2,000 in savings accounts for her 16-year-old son and three-year-old grandson in addition to saving for her retirement and a rainy-day fund. And as the Fed pumps more money into the financial system by buying Treasury securities and indirectly supporting federal stimulus programs, the run-up in stock markets is likely to continue — and leave people like Tan even further behind than they already were. \n\tAllan Sloan is a former editor at large at ProPublica and a columnist at The Washington Post. \n\tCezary Podkul was a reporter for ProPublica who wrote about finance.

        "text": "November 1, 2019 13 min read Is Inequality Inevitable? Wealth naturally trickles up in free-market economies, model suggests By Bruce M. Boghosian  Hanna Barczyk Wealth inequality is escalating at an alarming rate not only within the U.S. but also in countries as diverse as Russia, India and Brazil. According to investment bank Credit Suisse, the fraction of global household wealth held by the richest 1 percent of the world's population increased from 42.5 to 47.2 percent between the financial crisis of 2008 and 2018. To put it another way, as of 2010, 388 individuals possessed as much household wealth as the lower half of the world's population combined—about 3.5 billion people; today Oxfam estimates that number as 26. Statistics from almost all nations that measure wealth in their household surveys indicate that it is becoming increasingly concentrated. Although the origins of inequality are hotly debated, an approach developed by physicists and mathematicians, including my group at Tufts University, suggests they have long been hiding in plain sight—in a well-known quirk of arithmetic. This method uses models of wealth distribution collectively known as agent-based, which begin with an individual transaction between two “agents” or actors, each trying to optimize his or her own financial outcome. In the modern world, nothing could seem more fair or natural than two people deciding to exchange goods, agreeing on a price and shaking hands. Indeed, the seeming stability of an economic system arising from this balance of supply and demand among individual actors is regarded as a pinnacle of Enlightenment thinking—to the extent that many people have come to conflate the free market with the notion of freedom itself. Our deceptively simple mathematical models, which are based on voluntary transactions, suggest, however, that it is time for a serious reexamination of this idea. In particular, the affine wealth model (called thus because of its mathematical properties) can describe wealth distribution among households in diverse developed countries with exquisite precision while revealing a subtle asymmetry that tends to concentrate wealth. We believe that this purely analytical approach, which resembles an x-ray in that it is used not so much to represent the messiness of the real world as to strip it away and reveal the underlying skeleton, provides deep insight into the forces acting to increase poverty and inequality today.

In 1986 social scientist John Angle first described the movement and distribution of wealth as arising from pairwise transactions among a collection of “economic agents,” which could be individuals, households, companies, funds or other entities. By the turn of the century physicists Slava Ispolatov, Pavel L. Krapivsky and Sidney Redner, then all working together at Boston University, as well as Adrian Drăgulescu, now at Constellation Energy Group, and Victor Yakovenko of the University of Maryland, had demonstrated that these agent-based models could be analyzed with the tools of statistical physics, leading to rapid advances in our understanding of their behavior. As it turns out, many such models find wealth moving inexorably from one agent to another—even if they are based on fair exchanges between equal actors. In 2002 Anirban Chakraborti, then at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kolkata, India, introduced what came to be known as the yard sale model, called thus because it has certain features of real one-on-one economic transactions. He also used numerical simulations to demonstrate that it inexorably concentrated wealth, resulting in oligarchy. Credit: Brown Bird Design To understand how this happens, suppose you are in a casino and are invited to play a game. You must place some ante—say, $100—on a table, and a fair coin will be flipped. If the coin comes up heads, the house will pay you 20 percent of what you have on the table, resulting in $120 on the table. If the coin comes up tails, the house will take 17 percent of what you have on the table, resulting in $83 left on the table. You can keep your money on the table for as many flips of the coin as you would like (without ever adding to or subtracting from it). Each time you play, you will win 20 percent of what is on the table if the coin comes up heads, and you will lose 17 percent of it if the coin comes up tails. Should you agree to play this game? You might construct two arguments, both rather persuasive, to help you decide what to do. You may think, “I have a probability of ½ of gaining $20 and a probability of ½ of losing $17. My expected gain is therefore: ½ x ($20) + ½ x (-$17) = $1.50 which is positive. In other words, my odds of winning and losing are even, but my gain if I win will be greater than my loss if I lose.” From this perspective it seems advantageous to play this game. Or, like a chess player, you might think further: “What if I stay for 10 flips of the coin? A likely outcome is that five of them will come up heads and that the other five will come up tails. Each time heads comes up, my ante is multiplied by 1.2. Each time tails comes up, my ante is multiplied by 0.83. After five wins and five losses in any order, the amount of money remaining on the table will be: 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.83 x 0.83 x 0.83 x 0.83 x 0.83 x $100 = $98.02 so I will have lost about $2 of my original $100 ante.” With a bit more work you can confirm that it would take about 93 wins to compensate for 91 losses. From this perspective it seems disadvantageous to play this game. The contradiction between the two arguments presented here may seem surprising at first, but it is well known in probability and finance. Its connection with wealth inequality is less familiar, however. To extend the casino metaphor to the movement of wealth in an (exceedingly simplified) economy, let us imagine a system of 1,000 individuals who engage in pairwise exchanges with one another. Let each begin with some initial wealth, which could be exactly equal. Choose two agents at random and have them transact, then do the same with another two, and so on. In other words, this model assumes sequential transactions between randomly chosen pairs of agents. Our plan is to conduct millions or billions of such transactions in our population of 1,000 and see how the wealth ultimately gets distributed. Credit: Hanna Barczyk What should a single transaction between a pair of agents look like? People have a natural aversion to going broke, so we assume that the amount at stake, which we call Δω (Δω is pronounced “delta w”), is a mere fraction of the wealth of the poorer person, Shauna. That way, even if Shauna loses in a transaction with Eric, the richer person, the amount she loses is always less than her own total wealth. This is not an unreasonable assumption and in fact captures a self-imposed limitation that most people instinctively observe in their economic life. To begin with—just because these numbers are familiar to us—let us suppose Δω is 20 percent of Shauna's wealth, ω, if she wins and –17 percent of ω if she loses. (Our actual model assumes that the win and loss percentages are equal, but the general outcome still holds. Moreover, increasing or decreasing Δω will just extend the time scale so that more transactions will be required before we can see the ultimate result, which will remain unaltered.) If our goal is to model a fair and stable market economy, we ought to begin by assuming that nobody has an advantage of any kind, so let us decide the direction in which w is moved by the flip of a fair coin. If the coin comes up heads, Shauna gets 20 percent of her wealth from Eric; if the coin comes up tails, she must give 17 percent of it to Eric. Now randomly choose another pair of agents from the total of 1,000 and do it again. In fact, go ahead and do this a million times or a billion times. What happens? If you simulate this economy, a variant of the yard sale model, you will get a remarkable result: after a large number of transactions, one agent ends up as an “oligarch” holding practically all the wealth of the economy, and the other 999 end up with virtually nothing. It does not matter how much wealth people started with. It does not matter that all the coin flips were absolutely fair. It does not matter that the poorer agent's expected outcome was positive in each transaction, whereas that of the richer agent was negative. Any single agent in this economy could have become the oligarch—in fact, all had equal odds if they began with equal wealth. In that sense, there was equality of opportunity. But only one of them did become the oligarch, and all the others saw their average wealth decrease toward zero as they conducted more and more transactions. To add insult to injury, the lower someone's wealth ranking, the faster the decrease. This outcome is especially surprising because it holds even if all the agents started off with identical wealth and were treated symmetrically. Physicists describe phenomena of this kind as “symmetry breaking” [see The Physics of Inequality below]. The very first coin flip transfers money from one agent to another, setting up an imbalance between the two. And once we have some variance in wealth, however minute, succeeding transactions will systematically move a “trickle” of wealth upward from poorer agents to richer ones, amplifying inequality until the system reaches a state of oligarchy. If the economy is unequal to begin with, the poorest agent's wealth will probably decrease the fastest. Where does it go? It must go to wealthier agents because there are no poorer agents. Things are not much better for the second-poorest agent. In the long run, all participants in this economy except for the very richest one will see their wealth decay exponentially. In separate papers in 2015 my colleagues and I at Tufts University and Christophe Chorro of Université Panthéon-Sorbonne provided mathematical proofs of the outcome that Chakraborti's simulations had uncovered—that the yard sale model moves wealth inexorably from one side to the other. Does this mean that poorer agents never win or that richer agents never lose? Certainly not. Once again, the setup resembles a casino—you win some and you lose some, but the longer you stay in the casino, the more likely you are to lose. The free market is essentially a casino that you can never leave. When the trickle of wealth described earlier, flowing from poor to rich in each transaction, is multiplied by 7.7 billion people in the world conducting countless transactions every year, the trickle becomes a torrent. Inequality inevitably grows more pronounced because of the collective effects of enormous numbers of seemingly innocuous but subtly biased transactions. You might, of course, wonder how this model, even if mathematically accurate, has anything to do with reality. After all, it describes an entirely unstable economy that inevitably degenerates to complete oligarchy, and there are no complete oligarchies in the world. It is true that, by itself, the yard sale model is unable to explain empirical wealth distributions. To address this deficiency, my group has refined it in three ways to make it more realistic. In 2017 Adrian Devitt-Lee, Merek Johnson, Jie Li, Jeremy Marcq, Hongyan Wang and I, all at Tufts, incorporated the redistribution of wealth. In keeping with the simplicity desirable in applied mathematics models, we did this by having each agent take a step toward the mean wealth in the society after each transaction. The size of the step was some fraction χ (or “chi”) of his or her distance from the mean. This is equivalent to a flat wealth tax for the wealthy (with tax rate χ per unit time) and a complementary subsidy for the poor. In effect, it transfers wealth from those above the mean to those below it. We found that this simple modification stabilized the wealth distribution so that oligarchy no longer resulted. And astonishingly, it enabled our model to match empirical data on U.S. and European wealth distribution between 1989 and 2016 to better than 2 percent. The single parameter χ seems to subsume a host of real-world taxes and subsidies that would be too messy to include separately in a skeletal model such as this one. Credit: Jen Christiansen In addition, it is well documented that the wealthy enjoy systemic economic advantages such as lower interest rates on loans and better financial advice, whereas the poor suffer systemic economic disadvantages such as payday lenders and a lack of time to shop for the best prices. As James Baldwin once observed, “Anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor.” Accordingly, in the same paper mentioned above, we factored in what we call wealth-attained advantage. We biased the coin flip in favor of the wealthier individual by an amount proportional to a new parameter, ζ (or “zeta”), times the wealth difference divided by the mean wealth. This rather simple refinement, which serves as a proxy for a multitude of biases favoring the wealthy, improved agreement between the model and the upper tail of actual wealth distributions. The inclusion of wealth-related bias also yields—and gives a precise mathematical definition to—the phenomenon of partial oligarchy. Whenever the influence of wealth-attained advantage exceeds that of redistribution (more precisely, whenever ζ exceeds χ), a vanishingly small fraction of people will possess a finite fraction, 1 − χ/ζ, of societal wealth. The onset of partial oligarchy is in fact a phase transition for another model of economic transactions, as first described in 2000 by physicists Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, now at École Polytechnique, and Marc Mézard of the École Normale Supérieure. In our model, when ζ is less than χ, the system has only one stable state with no oligarchy; when ζ exceeds χ, a new, oligarchical state appears and becomes the stable state [see graphic above]. The two-parameter (χ and ζ) extended yard sale model thus obtained can match empirical data on U.S. and European wealth distribution between 1989 and 2016 to within 1 to 2 percent. Such a phase transition may have played a crucial role in the condensation of wealth following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The imposition of what was called shock therapy economics on the former states of the U.S.S.R. resulted in a dramatic decrease of wealth redistribution (that is, decreasing χ) by their governments and a concomitant jump in wealth-attained advantage (increasing ζ) from the combined effects of sudden privatization and deregulation. The resulting decrease of the “temperature” χ/ζ threw the countries into a wealth-condensed state, so that formerly communist countries became partial oligarchies almost overnight. To the present day at least 10 of the 15 former Soviet republics can be accurately described as oligarchies. As a third refinement, in 2019 we included negative wealth—one of the more disturbing aspects of modern economies—in our model. In 2016, for example, approximately 10.5 percent of the U.S. population was in net debt because of mortgages, student loans and other factors. So we introduced a third parameter, κ (or “kappa”), which shifts the wealth distribution downward, thereby accounting for negative wealth. We supposed that the least wealth the poorest agent could have at any time was –S, where S equals κ times the mean wealth. Prior to each transaction, we loaned wealth S to both agents so that each had positive wealth. They then transacted according to the extended yard sale model, described earlier, after which they both repaid their debt of S. The three-parameter (χ, ζ, κ) model thus obtained, called the affine wealth model, can match empirical data on U.S. wealth distribution to less than a sixth of a percent over a span of three decades. (In mathematics, the word “affine” describes something that scales multiplicatively and translates additively. In this case, some features of the model, such as the value of Δω, scale multiplicatively with the wealth of the agent, whereas other features, such as the addition or subtraction of S, are additive translations or displacements in “wealth space.”) Agreement with European wealth-distribution data for 2010 is typically better than a third to a half of a percent [see box below]. To obtain these comparisons with actual data, we had to solve the “inverse problem.” That is, given the empirical wealth distribution, we had to find the values of (χ, ζ, κ) at which the results of our model most closely matched it. As just one example, the 2016 U.S. household wealth distribution is best described as having χ = 0.036, ζ = 0.050 and κ = 0.058. The affine wealth model has been applied to empirical data from many countries and epochs. To the best of our knowledge, it describes wealth-distribution data more accurately than any other existing model. Credit: Jen Christiansen; Source: Bruce M. Boghosian; European Central Bank (country data) We find it noteworthy that the best-fitting model for empirical wealth distribution discovered so far is one that would be completely unstable without redistribution rather than one based on a supposed equilibrium of market forces. In fact, these mathematical models demonstrate that far from wealth trickling down to the poor, the natural inclination of wealth is to flow upward, so that the “natural” wealth distribution in a free-market economy is one of complete oligarchy. It is only redistribution that sets limits on inequality. The mathematical models also call attention to the enormous extent to which wealth distribution is caused by symmetry breaking, chance and early advantage (from, for example, inheritance). And the presence of symmetry breaking puts paid to arguments for the justness of wealth inequality that appeal to “voluntariness”—the notion that individuals bear all responsibility for their economic outcomes simply because they enter into transactions voluntarily—or to the idea that wealth accumulation must be the result of cleverness and industriousness. It is true that an individual's location on the wealth spectrum correlates to some extent with such attributes, but the overall shape of that spectrum can be explained to better than 0.33 percent by a statistical model that completely ignores them. Luck plays a much more important role than it is usually accorded, so that the virtue commonly attributed to wealth in modern society—and, likewise, the stigma attributed to poverty—is completely unjustified. Moreover, only a carefully designed mechanism for redistribution can compensate for the natural tendency of wealth to flow from the poor to the rich in a market economy. Redistribution is often confused with taxes, but the two concepts ought to be kept quite separate. Taxes flow from people to their governments to finance those governments' activities. Redistribution, in contrast, may be implemented by governments, but it is best thought of as a flow of wealth from people to people to compensate for the unfairness inherent in market economics. In a flat redistribution scheme, all those possessing wealth below the mean would receive net funds, whereas those above the mean would pay. And precisely because current levels of inequality are so extreme, far more people would receive than would pay. Given how complicated real economies are, we find it gratifying that a simple analytical approach developed by physicists and mathematicians describes the actual wealth distributions of multiple nations with unprecedented precision and accuracy. Also rather curious is that these distributions display subtle but key features of complex physical systems. Most important, however, the fact that a sketch of the free market as simple and plausible as the affine wealth model gives rise to economies that are anything but free and fair should be both a cause for alarm and a call for action.

        "text": "The world is awash in personal wealth: $153.2 trillion in total, according to Allianz’s new Global Wealth Report 2015. That’s enough to pay three times the world’s sovereign debt, the debts of each nation. The report, which measured 2014 wealth, found 2014 was the third consecutive year in which global wealth grew more than 7%. The jump was largely the result of households pumping up their personal savings efforts. The U.S.—with $63.5 trillion in total private wealth—holds the largest amount of any country in the world. But that wealth is unevenly distributed, and nowhere is that more evident than in the U.S., which also has the largest wealth inequality gap of 55 countries studied, according to the report. While America’s growing income inequality has been the source of much debate, this report examined the wealth—which includes not just salary, but also property and investments held by a family. The report found that America’s wealth inequality is even more gaping its income inequality. In fact, the report dubbed the U.S. the “Unequal States of America” due to the size of the gap. The richest countries Not surprisingly, the U.S., Canada and European countries dominate the top 10 list of wealthiest countries. But this year, for the first time, China moved past Japan in the number #2 spot, largely because of the appreciation last year of equity markets there. The U.S. remains in the top spot, with 41.6% of the world’s wealth, according to the report by Allianz, a financial services giant. Here are the top 10 countries, with their percentages of total global personal wealth. Wealth inequality in the US And yet, with the overall growth of wealth, inequality remains a persistent issue, especially in the United States. For the first time in this report series, Allianz calculated each country’s wealth Gini coefficient—a measure of inequality in which 0 is perfect equality and 100 would mean perfect inequality, or one person owning all the wealth. It found that the U.S. had the most wealth inequality, with a score of 80.56, showing the most concentration of overall wealth in the hands of the proportionately fewest people. In comparison, when the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) examined income inequality, it found that the U.S.  has the fourth highest income Gini coefficient—0.40—after Turkey, Mexico, and Chile. Ironically, the second highest Gini score overall in the Allianz report was found in Sweden, a nation long thought of as egalitarian.  © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

        "text": "According to New York Times columnist David Brooks, socioeconomic segregation is ruining America. “Housing and construction rules that keep the poor and less educated away from places with good schools and good job opportunities…have a devastating effect on economic growth nationwide,” Brooks wrote in a much-derided July 11 column. (Derided not for the sentiment outlined above so much as the evidence, which involved Italian cold cuts as a restrictive cultural signifier for the American upper middle class.) Salami aside, Brooks has a point. There’s an widening gulf in the United States between the haves and the have-nots. The columnist points to education and metropolitan zoning restrictions as reinforcement for this unequal system, with statistics to support the argument. But how true is it? We asked urbanist, author, and University of Toronto professor Richard Florida to weigh in. (Florida is best-known for his concept of the “creative class.”) Here’s what he said, edited and condensed for clarity. When did this wealth gap problem start?\nBasically, this wealth gap that we see today is something that has really skyrocketed since about the 1980s and certainly in the past decade, decade and a half. How bad is the wealth inequality we’re seeing in the United States?\nThe income inequality in the United States, according to the Gini coefficient (a measure of inequality where 0 is perfectly equal and 1 is perfectly unequal) is about 0.45, which is awful—worse than Iran. How about in cities specifically?\nIn cities that inequality is even greater. There’s a table in my book (The New Urban Crisis, Basic Books, $28) showing this. Inequality in New York City is like Swaziland. Miami’s is like Zimbabwe. Los Angeles is equivalent to Sri Lanka. I actually look at the difference between the 95th percentile of income earners in big cities and the lower 20%. In the New York metro area, the 95th percentile makes $282,000 and the 20th percentile makes $23,000. These gaps between the rich and the poor in income and wealth are vast across the country and even worse in our cities. What is this idea of a “knowledge-based economy”?\nFirst introduced in the 1950s and 1960s by Fritz Malchup and Peter Drucker, the idea is that the economy is powered by knowledge, ideas and talent as opposed to resources and industry. Shouldn’t having access to the same schools and being in close proximity to different socioeconomic classes make it easier to move out of your financial situation?\nThe research of other economists do show that in terms of upward mobility, living in cities like New York or San Francisco or Boston tends to be better for upward mobility than living in sprawling, more suburban areas. That said, what makes it harder —and this is the core theme of The New Urban Crisis—is that middle class neighborhoods are disappearing. In the past, most Americans lived in middle class neighborhoods, whether that was in the city or the suburbs. In the 1970s about 70% Americans lived in middle class neighborhoods. Now less than 40% of us do. And guess where middle class neighborhoods declined the most? In our largest, the most densest, knowledge-based metropolitan areas. Why have these middle class neighborhoods disappeared?\nNot only has income inequality and wealth inequality grown, the segregation of people not necessarily by race or by ethnicity—that’s a separate question—but by socioeconomic class has grown. The wealthy have moved to much more concentrated areas of wealth. And those areas are surrounded by areas with much more concentrated disadvantage. The wealthy and the well educated and the more affluent have walled themselves off in separate neighborhoods. The growth in economic segregation really occurred in the last decade. In our biggest cities we see the biggest loss of the middle class. We see the biggest gaps not only between wealth in general, but where rich people and more educated knowledge workers live and where less advantaged people live. Is the economic segregation perpetuated by zoning laws or individuals?\nI think it’s both. In the past, exclusionary zoning in the suburbs really functioned to keep poor people, less affluent people out. Today, I think the key factor is simply that wealthy, affluent people wanted to move back to cities. That’s what happens not only when wealthy people but creative people, affluent people, interesting people live in cities—they become more productive and more innovative. Cities become more attractive to high tech firms, innovative companies and creative organizations. So you have more competition for limited space. When you have more competition for limited space, the land value goes up. Then increasingly, you’ve got to be rich to afford space in a city. I think the zoning laws have contributed to it, but one thing I found interesting was that the biggest inequality, segregation and housing unaffordability occurred in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco—but Houston, a place that mostly doesn’t have zoning laws and building restrictions, is high on the list as well. David Brooks wrote a column for The New York Times a few weeks ago touching on the culture of urbanites and how that relates to the wealth gap and segregated neighborhoods. Are Brooks’ assertions about how the elites have created cultural barriers to socioeconomic mobility valid?\nI think it is a mistake to blame people who work hard, put work into selecting their partners and making sure their marriages work, and invest in their kids. Isn’t that what the American Dream is supposed to be about? I think the barriers are much more formal and institutional than informal. Is the geographic divide of the American people based on socioeconomic status a result of the wealth gap or is it an underlying cause perpetuating the widening wealth gap?\nThey reinforce one another. Doesn’t the clustering of innovation in a select few cities and states put places that depend less on knowledge-based economies at a disadvantage?\nWell those states are going to get left behind and they’re going to grow angrier and angrier. This is what I like to call the political contradiction of American capitalism, where the things we need to grow in our economy, increasingly larger portions of the country don’t want to invest in. How has the wealth gap affected the American people?\nThis gap between the rich and poor, the haves and the have-nots, is what produced the backlash that brought Donald Trump to power. Our country isn’t just divided by politics or class, it’s divided by where you live. The advantaged urban parts of the country by the coast—New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles—they’re the blue areas, but the rest of America is increasingly red. The wealth gap that’s occurring in places is behind the political backlash we’re seeing in our country. Can we reverse this divide that’s happening between large cities and rural areas?\nI think this, what I call spatial geographic inequality, is a deep fundamental characteristic of knowledge-based economies because what drives economic growth is a clustering of diverse, talented people in small areas. That’s where the basic force of economic growth comes from, so the more we cluster in New York or San Francisco or wherever, the more we drive economic growth. The more innovation we create, the more we compete for space and those housing values. The finance industry, the media industry, the music industry all cluster in certain places. I think it’s going to be very hard to counter this geographic inequality. How do we fix this?\nWe’re going to have to recognize that as Americans, we live in different places. Some want to live in dense, knowledge-based areas. Others will want to live in more suburban or rural parts of the country and pay less in taxes and spend less on schools. Across the country, people are going to want different things. We’re going to have to move from a highly centralized federal system to a system where our cities, suburbs and metropolitan areas can use their tax dollars to build the kinds of communities they want. By localizing governments, you can allow places to make the most of what they have. That way, we can begin to heal the divide in our country. Any last words?\nI think this inequality, not just between classes and wealth, but between locations is going to be the big issue of our time. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

        "text": "Advertisement A dislike of economic inequality supposedly runs deep in our psychology, but the evidence suggests that we actually prefer it that way By Mark Sheskin \n                                    27 March 2018\n                                    \n  YOU are probably aware that there are high levels of inequality in the world and that inequality is getting worse. But it is unlikely that you appreciate just how unequal things are. So here is a way of visualising it. Take the wealth of the eight richest people on the planet and combine it. Now do the same for the poorest 3.5 billion. The two sums are the same, £350 billion. Correct: just eight people own as much wealth as half of the world’s population. That is just one of many eye-watering measures of inequality. Consider that in the US, almost 85 per cent of the wealth is owned by just 20 per cent of the population, and the bottom 40 per cent own just 0.3 per cent of it. In 1960, a chief executive in the US typically earned 20 times as much as an average worker. Today it is more like 354 times. Most people find these numbers shocking, even obscene, and inequality has become one of the world’s most serious issues. Early in his second term, President Obama called it “the defining challenge of our time”; Pope Francis has described it as “the root of social evil”. The general public also rank it highly. When the Pew Research Center asked people in 44 countries whether they thought the gap between rich and poor was a “big problem”, a majority in all 44 said it was. A majority in 28 said it was a “very big” problem. Advertisement The idea that inequality needs to be reduced now almost goes without saying. I agree – but my training as a cognitive scientist warns me we should be careful how we go about it. Some fights for equality, such as against racial prejudice, are morally straightforward. But the battle against economic inequality isn’t so simple. As surprising as it might seem at first, some economic inequality is actually morally good. I recently explored this issue in the journal Nature Human Behaviour with two of my colleagues at Yale, Christina Starmans and Paul Bloom. We concluded that a crucial step in fighting inequality is realising that it is not all bad. If we want to beat inequality, we must first distinguish between the bad sort and the good sort. The dislike of economic inequality supposedly runs deep in human psychology. The trait we call “inequality aversion” emerges early in development and is found across many cultures, from city dwellers in the US to villagers in Peru and Uganda. Laboratory studies confirm that inequality aversion is a strong motivator of behaviour. For example, when people are asked to divide money among themselves and fellow subjects in experiments, they have a clear preference for equal distribution. This desire for equality is so powerful that people often choose to receive smaller but more equal rewards over larger but more unequal ones, and in other cases prefer surplus resources to be thrown away rather than distributed unequally. There is, however, a paradox. A separate body of research finds something quite different. When people are asked about the ideal distribution of wealth in their country rather than among a small group of individuals in the lab, they are actually quite relaxed about inequality.  In one influential study, for instance, researchers asked a representative sample of 5500 Americans about their ideal distribution of wealth in the US. On average, people said that the richest 20 per cent should hold 30 per cent of the wealth, and the bottom 20 per cent just 10 per cent. When forced to choose between high levels of inequality and complete equality, most chose the former. The authors concluded that most Americans desire greater equality, but not to the extent of living in a completely equal society. Similar results have been found in many other countries, and in people from all points on the political spectrum. This body of research casts serious doubt on inequality aversion. In fact, my colleagues and I argue there is no evidence that people are actually bothered by economic inequality. How can these apparently contradictory findings be reconciled? Is one wrong and the other right? No. We think they are both correct. They can be explained by a dislike not of inequality, but of something that is often confounded with it: economic unfairness. Equality and fairness seem like the same thing, but are subtly different. For example, when grading student papers, teachers give better marks to better papers. Likewise, if you and I co-run a bakery at which you work four days a week and I work the other three, you would expect to receive four-sevenths of the profits. A school that gave all students the same mark regardless of merit, or a bakery at which you work more than me but are paid the same, would be equal, but not fair. This is what we call “unfair equality”. The opposite of this, fair inequality, strikes most people as the better option. When fairness and equality clash, people prefer fair inequality over unfair equality. This preference can explain the apparent paradox of why people opt for equal distribution in the lab, but unequal distribution in the real world. Most of the lab experiments don’t distinguish between fairness and equality. If you are simply asked to allocate some money to yourself and somebody else with no consideration of merit – say, who worked hardest – then an equal outcome is also the fairest outcome. Giving yourself most of the money and your peer less feels wrong not because it is unequal, but because it is unfair. Some lab studies do take this into account, and find that our aversion to unfairness is stronger than our aversion to inequality. For example, when asked to divvy up five erasers to two boys as a reward for cleaning their rooms, most people – even young children – want to give them two erasers each and discard the surplus. But when told that one boy worked harder, they happily give him the extra eraser.

For instance, even though current economic conditions in wealthy nations lead to a preference for reducing inequality, in various other societies across the world and across history – the USSR, for example – concerns about fairness have led to anger about too much equality. People are also generally happy with gross inequalities created by national lotteries. If everyone knows that the outcome is random, one person receiving millions and everyone else nothing seems entirely fair and reasonable. There are many reasons why we might prefer a society with some wealth inequality. One is a hope that we will become one of the wealthier people ourselves. Another is that it promotes industriousness and social mobility. But a more important motivator is the intuitive judgement that it is inherently right for valuable contributors to be more highly compensated. As an example, I think that a scientist who develops a medicine that saves many lives, or a writer who creates a story enjoyed by millions, should have more wealth than me. They have earned it. This intuition for fairness is deeply ingrained, and recent evolutionary analyses have elucidated where it comes from. First, take a moment to appreciate just how different human achievements are from those of other species, from arranging our social interactions into democracies to developing technologies to send people and robots into space. You might also think of less noble “achievements” such as wars or factory farming. What features of the human brain allow us to achieve these large-scale outcomes? Some common-sense answers include our capacity for language or advanced reasoning, but these are of little use without a commitment to fairness. To see why fairness is so important, imagine someone marooned on an island, such as Tom Hanks’s character in the movie Cast Away. However articulate and clever this unfortunate person is, they will struggle to survive. It is only when we look at humans in a group, cooperating, that we stand out from other species. As historian Yuval Noah Harari put it in his bestseller Sapiens: “One on one, even 10 on 10, we are embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. Significant differences begin to appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when we reach 1,000-2,000 individuals, the differences are astounding.” Fairness is what allows humans to work together in large groups. Wouldn’t you prefer to team up with someone who puts in at least a fair share of the effort and takes at most a fair share of the reward, rather than somebody who is lazy or greedy? Likewise, others will prefer to interact with you if you have a reputation for fairness. Over our evolutionary history, individuals who cooperated fairly outcompeted those who didn’t, and so evolution produced our modern, moral brains, with their focus on fairness. Western society is more unequal than it has been for decadesChris Steele-Perkins/Magnum Photos Western society is more unequal than it has been for decades Chris Steele-Perkins/Magnum Photos This trait benefits everyone. Indeed, those who benefit most are sometimes those who receive the least from it. As a concrete example, imagine that we are hunter-gatherers living 20,000 years ago, and that fishing trips are best done by two people. You are a skilled fisher. Each day, you need to decide whether to go fishing with another skilled fisher with whom you are likely to jointly catch 16 fish, or me, an unskilled fisher with whom you are likely to catch only 10. If everyone demands equal divisions, then you will always choose the other skilled fisher instead of me. But rather than being left to starve, I might argue for the virtues of fairness, and suggest that I will only take two fish. So you can go out with either me or the third person and still end up with eight fish. Despite our strong evolution-based motivation for fairness, people often act quite unfairly. This shouldn’t come as a surprise: we have many competing motivations that trade off with one another. One of them is greed. Thus, if we want to achieve greater fairness, it is important to know how and why the motivation for it increases or decreases. Many studies have shown that it depends on context. Most notably, the motivation is quite high when people know they are being evaluated by others who can choose whether to interact with them in the future. Likewise, being in an environment in which it is common to interact with strangers – and in which any given one of them is a potential partner – leads to higher levels of fair behaviour. Even small environmental cues can have large effects: in one study, participants played an economic decision-making game called either “the community game” or “the Wall Street game”. Although the actual content was identical for everyone, individuals in groups told they were playing the community game made more cooperative decisions and expected the other players to do the same. Such research on how people think about fairness has obvious ramifications for contentious social issues such as executive pay, taxation and welfare. Fair inequality appears to be a desirable, even natural, state of affairs. What level of it should we seek? “If inequality is a desirable state of affairs, what level of it should we seek?” As a cognitive scientist, my role is not to make such judgements, only to point out facts that might be useful for people who do. But I am also a person who wants to see the world become a better place. In advancing the fight against unfair inequality, I find the ancient military treatise The Art of War useful. In it, Sun Tzu advises that: “If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be put at risk even in a hundred battles.” I think this advice is essential: knowing how we all think about fairness and equality, and where these judgements come from, is vital for properly combating unfair inequality, and for recruiting others into the fight. Consider, for example, the fact that people in economically developed nations are often appalled by the wages and working conditions in developing countries, leading to calls for boycotts on certain products. It may be that this is a misapplication of our sense of fairness: considering what is a fair wage in an area requires knowing things such as local costs and the alternative jobs available. It would be unfortunate if misjudgement meant people in developed nations acted to eliminate valued jobs in developing nations. Such considerations will become even more important over time, as economic progress moves us further from our evolutionary past. The best hunter or gatherer in a group couldn’t possibly be a million times more productive than average, but it is entirely possible that people like Elon Musk or Oprah Winfrey contribute more than a million times as much to society as I do. Should we reward them proportionately? Or should there be a maximum that any one person can have? In other words, what are the limits of fair inequality and unfair equality? Similarly, if in the future our economy can produce abundant wealth with machines rather than people doing most of the work, what will be the fair way to distribute the wealth they create? The fight against inequality is most certainly a fight worth having. The distribution of wealth in countries such as the US is heavily skewed away from what people consider to be fair, let alone equal. Working out what constitutes fair distribution will require us to answer many difficult moral and practical questions, but this will become easier the more we understand the psychology of how people judge equality and fairness. There are staggering levels of inequality in the world, and wide agreement that these should be reduced. But we should aspire to fair inequality, not unfair equality.

        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "Taking a modern-century spin on “Let them eat cake,” shareholders are having the whole cake, and eating it too. It’s no shock the boardroom is able to stay above the fray as wealthy members are more equipped to weather economic downturns. But it turns out CEOs and shareholders are walking away with an even greater slice of profits than one might think. So finds a recent report from Oxfam, a British nonprofit focused on eradicating poverty, which analyzed more than 200 U.S. corporations to assess their “inequality footprint.” Most money ends up funneling into the mouths of those at the top, as 90% (or $1.1 trillion) of the combined $1.25 trillion in net profits for those companies analyzed went to paying wealthy shareholders. \n\n\n\n Executives are doing quite all right as well. CEO pay has ballooned since the pandemic hit, increasing by 31% from 2018 to 2022. “Shareholders and CEO pay have risen to record levels in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis,” according to the report.\n\n\n\n “The rules are being rigged and the companies are helping to rig them,” Irit Tamir, senior director of Oxfam America’s private sector department, tells Fortune, speaking of company taxation that has gone down due to a strong corporate-lobbying presence. \n\n\n\n This past year has been marked by layoffs in the finance, tech, and media sectors as many CEOs claim to need to downsize in light of economic strain. But it seems as if corporations are doing better than ever. Revenue and profits at Fortune 500 companies grew significantly between 2014 and 2022, hiking even more in the years after the pandemic hit. In the same breath that Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg announced layoffs for more than 10,000 workers in the name of a “year of efficiency,” the company announced a fresh $40 billion stock-buyback option. Less than a year later, Meta announced plans to buy back another $50 billion.  \n While money was seemingly tight for some, it was an equivalent of Christmas for those at the top: Stock buybacks in 2022 hit a record of $681 billion, per Oxfam.\n\n\n\n The consolidation of power at the top has been a decades-long process. The concept of shareholder primacy started to take hold in the 1970s, per Tamir, who added that while companies started to prioritize this group, safeguards for workers were fading as union membership ebbed. In the 1980s, stock buybacks, once banned as a form of stock manipulation, became legal. Tamir says this change, specifically, allowed companies to inflate their stock prices. At the same time, corporate tax rates fell dramatically thanks to a series of tax cuts, first in the Reagan era and again during the Trump administration, while corporations gained more and more ability to directly influence politics, capped off with the 2010 Citizens United decision, in which the Supreme Court gave companies and wealthy individuals carte blanche to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.\n\n\n\n “All of those things together have created sort of this perfect storm by which companies have gotten bigger, corporate power is on the rise, and the benefits that they’ve accrued in profit they are funneling to a smaller number of people,” Tamir says, adding that the other stakeholders—the workers—“are losing out.” \n\n\n\n There are some signs of change. Unionization is growing in popularity after a year of strikes and some high-profile wins on behalf of workers—like the UAW and, recently, the Starbucks union. \n\n\n\n “There are some promising signs, but if we don’t continue down that path, we are already essentially in a new Gilded Age,” says Tamir, echoing President Joe Biden’s rhetoric on checking corporations more.  \n While wages remain fairly stagnant, or barely high enough to compete with the pace of inflation, CEOs have given themselves a hefty raise. CEOs were paid a combined $4.1 billion in 2022, per Oxfam’s analysis of the 186 companies that had hard data. Only 5% of the companies examined publicly said they support a living wage. The wage gap continues to widen among larger companies: McDonald’s, for instance, has a CEO-to-worker pay gap of 1,745 to one. Another prototypical American brand, the Coca-Cola Company, has a pay gap of 1,594 to one. \n\n\n\n The divide is most apparent in the retail sector. Retail workers are often people of color and women, though the top leaders at these companies are often white men, according to Oxfam. While many companies said they were looking to make DEI targets, many came up empty-handed when it came to hard data. \n\n\n\n “They are talking a good game, but when it comes to actually doing something about it, most are not doing anything that is at least transparent to the public,” Tamir says. “All of these things are technically legal and unfortunately to the detriment of the rest of us.” \n\n\n\n Tamir says in the long term, even the most wealthy will suffer. Dollar Tree might be the least equitable of the companies from a gender and racial perspective, according to Tamir, and earlier this year the company shut down 1,000 of its stores. \n\n\n\n “At the end of the day, this is bad for business,” Tamir explains. “Having wealth in the hands of fewer and fewer people is not good for an economy.” \n Read more of Fortune’s coverage on wealth, income, and inequality:\n A version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on March 18, 2024.   © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

A strong performance in financial markets, particularly an outsize gain for the stock market in 2021, helped entrench existing trends of wealth inequality during the pandemic. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)     \n NEW YORK (AP) — A strong performance in financial markets, particularly an outsize gain for the stock market in 2021, helped entrench existing trends of wealth inequality during the pandemic, new data released this week show. According to a report from the New York Federal Reserve Bank, the real net worth of white individuals outgrew that of Black and Hispanic individuals by 30 percentage points and 9 percentage points respectively, from the first quarter of 2019 through the second quarter of 2023. The period featured a remarkable level of government financial support and, after the initial shock of the pandemic, a surprisingly strong job market. The unemployment rate for Black Americans in particular is now at 5.3%, near a record low, compared to an overall unemployment rate of 3.7%. Earnings for the typical Black full-time worker are up 7.1% since before the pandemic.  Closing the wealth gap is more difficult because a significantly larger number of white households traditionally have money in stocks and mutual funds. A separate Fed survey shows that as of 2022, about 65.6% of white households had investments in stocks, compared with 28.3% for Hispanic households and 39.2% for Black households.  “The study really shows the difference between making gains when it comes to income, and closing that gap, versus when it comes to wealth,” said Janelle Jones, Vice President of Policy and Advocacy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \n While government support such as increased unemployment benefits and stimulus checks helped stave off a COVID-induced recession, financial asset prices rose so significantly with the reopening of the economy through 2021 that racial wealth disparities increased. And while those market-linked assets did fall in 2022 when the Federal Reserve rapidly increased interest rates, “those declines did not fully offset the earlier rises,” according to the New York Fed. “Much of the divergence in net worth by race and ethnicity since 2019 can be attributed to divergence in the real values of financial asset holdings,” wrote the report’s authors — including the fact that Black households have more wealth concentrated in pensions than in stocks, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. More than 50% of Black financial wealth is invested in pensions, the New York Fed found. Less than 20% of Black wealth is stored in private businesses, corporate equities, and mutual funds. In contrast, less than 30% of white financial wealth is invested in pensions, with about 50% invested in businesses, equities, and mutual funds. “Black workers are still more likely to be unionized, which may play a part in the pension story,” said Jones. “But how folks are exposed to the ability to invest in the stock market — whether or not it’s something they grow up doing — we know that’s different for white families than for people of color.” Black family members are less likely to get an inheritance, she said. During the pandemic, the real value of Black-held financial assets dropped in 2022 to below its 2019 level and continued to decline steadily, while the real value of Hispanic-held financial assets dipped below its 2019 level in 2022 and stagnated. Neither group’s real financial assets have recovered to their 2019 values. Owning a business is another component of financial wealth, and separate data show Black-owned businesses had a tougher time during the pandemic. While less than 10% of all U.S. business owners are Black, Black-owned businesses were also more concentrated in industries hardest hit when COVID first spread, according to Economic Policy Institute analysis of government data. In April of 2020, more than 40% of Black business owners reported they were not working, compared with only 17% of white business owners. The industries with the largest total job losses early in the pandemic were also sectors where more Black-owned businesses are concentrated — accommodation, food services, retail, health care, and social assistance. About 28% of Black-owned businesses are found in these industries, compared with just under 20% of white-owned businesses, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Still, Treasury Deputy Secretary Walley Adeyemo said Wednesday that economic conditions are improving for Black households, citing rising employment and wages for Black Americans since before the pandemic, and an increase in Black business ownership and participation in the stock market. Adeyemo suggested that some “policy prescriptions” might be needed to even out the distribution of financial wealth in the U.S. “The gap between Black and white wealth in America is still too great,” he said.  ___ “The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "domain": "theatlantic.com",
        "text": "Has the rise of the one percent really been debunked? Listen to more stories on the  Noa app. Everyone knows that inequality has gotten out of hand in the United States. Thanks largely to the work of three now-famous economists—Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel Zucman—it’s probably one of the most widely accepted facts in modern American life. Since the early aughts, they have meticulously documented the rate at which the richest have pulled away from the rest. Their research transformed domestic politics, leading President Barack Obama to declare inequality the “defining issue of our time,” and turning the one percent into a shorthand for excessive wealth and power. But what if this “fact” was never true? That’s exactly the claim that Gerald Auten and David Splinter, economists at the Treasury Department and Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation, respectively, make in a paper published last September. The massive rise in income inequality since the 1960s, they argue, is mostly a statistical illusion based on a series of methodological errors. Piketty, Saez, and Zucman found that the top one percent’s share of after-tax income rose from 9 percent in 1960 to 15 percent in 2019. But, according to Auten and Splinter, the one percent’s share of income has actually remained basically unchanged. The paper caused an immediate stir among economists and pundits. “Can a single self-published paper really refute decades of work by three famous economists?” wrote the influential economist Tyler Cowen in Bloomberg. “The answer—with qualifications—is yes.” In the Financial Times, the columnist Chris Giles asked, “How would you feel if you found out that U.S. income inequality had not risen over the past 60 years?” And The Economist, reviewing the debate, concluded that “the idea that inequality is rising is very far from a self-evident truth.” When I first heard about the new paper, I assumed it would convince me, at the very least, that inequality had risen less than I thought—that the reality was somewhere between the two groups’ estimates. But the deeper I dug into the debate, the more I felt that both teams were underestimating the extent of inequality in America. Both are limited by assumptions and definitions that are standard in the economics profession but contrary to how regular people think about inequality—or, for that matter, money itself. The biggest point of contention between the two camps revolves around “unreported income,” more commonly known as tax evasion. Tax returns are the best data source available for studying income distributions, but they’re incomplete—most obviously because people don’t report all of the income that they’re supposed to. This information gap requires inequality researchers to make some educated guesses about how unreported income is distributed, which is to say, about who is evading the most taxes. Piketty, Saez, and Zucman assume that it’s the people who already report a lot of income: Think of the well-paid corporate executive who also stashes millions of dollars in an offshore account. Auten and Splinter, by contrast, assume that those who evade the most taxes are people who report little or no income: Think plumbers or housekeepers who get paid in cash. They believe, in other words, that members of the 99 percent are a lot richer than they look. Both teams base their estimates on the results of random IRS audits. The problem is that those audits are woefully limited, so the researchers must turn to studies by tax-evasion specialists who use fancy statistical techniques to account for the gaps in the audits. Only a few such studies even exist, which may explain why both teams end up heavily relying on the same 2010 paper from the National Tax Journal by the economists Joel Slemrod and Andrew Johns. Somehow, each side claims that the paper—which is based on data going back to 2001—supports their conclusion and is being misread by the other group. In other words, whether inequality has soared or stagnated comes down in large part to the interpretation of a single study using data from more than 20 years ago. From the June 2018 issue: The 9.9 percent is the new American aristocracy When I called Slemrod to find out which side was citing his work correctly, even he wasn’t sure. The two camps, he told me, refer to different sections of the paper that seem to point in different directions. Anyway, Slemrod said, it didn’t really matter, because his paper was out of date. Newer research gives what he considers a more accurate picture. He directed me to a 2021 study that found that the IRS audit data systematically undercounted tax evasion by the rich. The authors of that study—one of whom is Gabriel Zucman—calculate that the top one percent’s unreported income is actually about 50 percent higher than even the Piketty estimates, once you account for the bias in the data. Auten and Splinter have critiqued this study, and its authors have, inevitably, critiqued the critique. Ultimately, which side you believe will depend on whether you accept Auten and Splinter’s suggestion that, even as IRS enforcement has gotten weaker and exotic tax-avoidance strategies have proliferated, the richest people in America have for some reason gotten better about paying their taxes. “To believe their results, you have to believe the top one percent has gotten much more compliant relative to the bottom 99 percent,” Zucman told me. “It doesn’t pass a basic smell test.” (Because Auten and Splinter are federal employees, they were not authorized to speak with me for this article.) These sorts of technical disagreements over wonky minutiae are the sine qua non of any good academic dispute. But they don’t, on their own, explain the full divergence between the two research teams. Much of the remaining disagreement ultimately comes down to the more philosophical question of how to define “income” in the first place. To take the true measure of inequality, economists need a way to account for all the income and expenses that don’t show up on people’s tax returns. The method that Piketty, Saez, and Zucman pioneered, and that Auten and Splinter follow, was to take the gross domestic product—a measure of all of the spending in the national economy every year—and figure out who exactly is receiving how much of it. (Technically, they use something called gross national income, which is a close cousin of GDP.) The benefit of this approach is that nothing gets left out. The drawback is that, well, nothing gets left out. GDP measures the total production of an entire economy, so it includes all sorts of expenditures that don’t seem like income at all. Much of the difference between the authors’ estimates of inequality hinges on how they treat government spending on things that benefit the public at large, such as education, infrastructure, and national defense. Because this spending is part of gross national income, it must be allocated to someone in order for the math to work out. Piketty, Saez, and Zucman take the view that this stuff really shouldn’t be considered income, so they allocate it in a way that doesn’t change the overall distribution. Auten and Splinter, however, argue that at least some of this money should count as income. Citing research indicating that education spending tends to disproportionately benefit lower- and middle-income kids, they decide to allocate the money in a way that increases the bottom 99 percent’s share of income—by a lot. Austin Clemens, a senior fellow at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, calculates that in Auten and Splinter’s data set, a full 20 percent of income for those in the bottom half of the distribution “comes in the form of tanks, roads, and chalkboards.” The teams likewise disagree over how to treat government deficits, which, for methodological reasons, likewise need to be allocated to someone. Piketty, Saez, and Zucman, perhaps sensing the absurdity of the whole exercise, again take a distributionally neutral approach. Auten and Splinter, meanwhile, argue that deficits have historically been more likely to be paid off by taxing the rich, so they allocate the money such that it reduces the top one percent’s share of income by nearly half a percentage point. Neither of these individual choices, in isolation, is enough to drastically alter either team’s conclusion. But the dueling data sets are littered with dozens of such judgment calls. When taken all together, they add up to two very different pictures of inequality in America. More revealing than any of these points of disagreement, however, are the ways in which the papers agree on how to define income. Take health-care benefits. Economists generally count both employer-sponsored health insurance and government programs such as Medicaid as income. In reality, people value these benefits far less than they would value the cash equivalent. But even putting that aside, the way this supposed income is defined—by dividing the total cost of the program by the number of recipients—can make it appear as if people are getting richer when they clearly are not. Rogé Karma: Why America abandoned the greatest economy in history Consider the following thought experiment, proposed to me by the Nobel Prize–winning economist Angus Deaton: A private-equity fund buys up a bunch of hospitals and immediately raises prices across the board, increasing the cost of health care without changing its quality. According to your typical economist, everyone receiving that health care now has a higher income than they did before. Or, Deaton said, imagine the reverse: The United States, which has the highest per-person health-care costs in the developed world, embarks on a heroic effort to lower its costs to the same level as Switzerland, the second-highest spender, without compromising quality. If that happened, it would appear in the income data as if Americans, on average, had each lost nearly $9,000 a year. This turns out to be not too far from how both inequality papers treat health-care spending. Over the same time period that poor Americans’ life expectancy stagnated and then declined, a massive boost in spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and employer-provided insurance has made it look as if those people have gotten significantly richer. If anything, both teams may be putting a thumb on the scale in favor of finding less inequality. The deeper you get into how GDP is actually calculated and allocated, the more you feel as though you’ve fallen through a wormhole into an alternate dimension. Let’s say you own a house. Government statisticians imagine that you are renting out that house to yourself, calculate how much money you would reasonably be charging, and then count that as a form of income that you are, in essence, paying yourself. This “imputed rent” accounts for about 9 percent of all GDP, or more than $2 trillion. Or suppose you have a checking account at a major bank. Statisticians will calculate the difference between what the bank pays you in interest on that account (usually close to nothing) and what you could have earned by investing that same money in safe government bonds. That difference is then considered the “full value” of the benefits you are receiving from the bank—above and beyond what it actually charges you for its services—and is therefore considered additional income for you, the depositor. All of these choices have some theoretical justification, but they have very little to do with how normal people think about their financial situation. There’s an old joke among economists that goes something like this: A policeman spots a drunk man searching for his keys under a lamppost and offers to help. After a few fruitless minutes, the officer asks the man where, exactly, he dropped his keys. “The tunnel over there,” the man says. “Then why look under the lamppost?” the officer asks. “Because the light is better here,” replies the man. It’s hard to read through these inequality papers—and the responses to them, and the responses to the responses—without feeling a little like the policeman. You find yourself caught in the middle of highly technical debates over the accuracy of audit studies, or who benefits most from education spending, or how often people roll over their retirement accounts (don’t even get me started on that one), all of which are supposed to tell you what has actually happened to income inequality over the past half century. But it turns out that the data being argued over are missing a lot of what you’re trying to measure, and the definition of income being used is one that most ordinary people wouldn’t even recognize. Both teams are claiming to have found something under the lamppost, but it might not be a set of keys. Oren Cass: The labor-shortage myth Luckily, we don’t have to rely on one data source or statistical technique to know that inequality has risen. The Congressional Budget Office finds that from 1979 to 2014, the top one percent’s share of after-tax income went up 6 percent. The Fed’s Survey of Consumer Finances and a 2023 study using tax data find similarly large increases when it comes to wealth. Then there’s plain old common sense. In 1982, the year Forbes released its first-ever annual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, the shipowner and real-estate tycoon Daniel Ludwig topped the list with a net worth of about $6 billion in today’s dollars. In 2023, the top three wealthiest individuals, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Larry Ellison, were worth $251 billion, $161 billion, and $158 billion, respectively. Inequality also manifests in ways that aren’t obviously economic: From 2001 to 2014, for example, the life expectancy of the wealthiest Americans rose by about three years—the equivalent of curing cancer—while the poorest experienced no gains. Perhaps only an economist could figure out a way to deny that the richest people are even richer than they used to be. Even if the case that inequality has remained flat isn’t convincing, exactly how much it has risen remains up for debate. (In fact, a growing body of research suggests that low-wage workers have made up a ton of ground since the pandemic, thanks to a tight labor market.) In the meantime, it’s worth remembering that economics is often far closer to the squishy humanities than to the hard sciences. Economic analysis can be a helpful corrective against human bias, but when its assumptions are divorced from the way people experience the world, it can just as easily lead us astray. Keep that in mind the next time a new paper comes out claiming to overturn the conventional wisdom. Support for this project was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

And you're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, a show about what's going on in culture and why it doesn't happen by accident.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LEAH GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: When President Trump sent the National Guard into the streets of Washington, D.C., earlier this month, he said his goal was to crack down on crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor. But citizens and homeless advocates alike have pointed out that his efforts affect some of the most vulnerable people among us.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: In a post on Truth Social over the weekend, he wrote in part, quote, \"the homeless have to move out immediately. We will give you places to stay, but far from the capital.\"LUSE: When these efforts were first announced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services. And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

And you're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, a show about what's going on in culture and why it doesn't happen by accident.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LEAH GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: When President Trump sent the National Guard into the streets of Washington, D.C., earlier this month, he said his goal was to crack down on crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor. But citizens and homeless advocates alike have pointed out that his efforts affect some of the most vulnerable people among us.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: In a post on Truth Social over the weekend, he wrote in part, quote, \"the homeless have to move out immediately. We will give you places to stay, but far from the capital.\"LUSE: When these efforts were first announced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services. And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8.

Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah.

But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

And you're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, a show about what's going on in culture and why it doesn't happen by accident.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LEAH GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: When President Trump sent the National Guard into the streets of Washington, D.C., earlier this month, he said his goal was to crack down on crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor. But citizens and homeless advocates alike have pointed out that his efforts affect some of the most vulnerable people among us.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: In a post on Truth Social over the weekend, he wrote in part, quote, \"the homeless have to move out immediately. We will give you places to stay, but far from the capital.\"LUSE: When these efforts were first announced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services. And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery.

But citizens and homeless advocates alike have pointed out that his efforts affect some of the most vulnerable people among us.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: In a post on Truth Social over the weekend, he wrote in part, quote, \"the homeless have to move out immediately. We will give you places to stay, but far from the capital.\"LUSE: When these efforts were first announced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services. And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

And you're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, a show about what's going on in culture and why it doesn't happen by accident.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LEAH GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: When President Trump sent the National Guard into the streets of Washington, D.C., earlier this month, he said his goal was to crack down on crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor. But citizens and homeless advocates alike have pointed out that his efforts affect some of the most vulnerable people among us.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: In a post on Truth Social over the weekend, he wrote in part, quote, \"the homeless have to move out immediately. We will give you places to stay, but far from the capital.\"LUSE: When these efforts were first announced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services. And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to.

I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

But citizens and homeless advocates alike have pointed out that his efforts affect some of the most vulnerable people among us.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: In a post on Truth Social over the weekend, he wrote in part, quote, \"the homeless have to move out immediately. We will give you places to stay, but far from the capital.\"LUSE: When these efforts were first announced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services. And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God.

And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on.

But citizens and homeless advocates alike have pointed out that his efforts affect some of the most vulnerable people among us.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: In a post on Truth Social over the weekend, he wrote in part, quote, \"the homeless have to move out immediately. We will give you places to stay, but far from the capital.\"LUSE: When these efforts were first announced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services. And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story?

And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

But citizens and homeless advocates alike have pointed out that his efforts affect some of the most vulnerable people among us.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: In a post on Truth Social over the weekend, he wrote in part, quote, \"the homeless have to move out immediately. We will give you places to stay, but far from the capital.\"LUSE: When these efforts were first announced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services. And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless.

It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

But citizens and homeless advocates alike have pointed out that his efforts affect some of the most vulnerable people among us.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: In a post on Truth Social over the weekend, he wrote in part, quote, \"the homeless have to move out immediately. We will give you places to stay, but far from the capital.\"LUSE: When these efforts were first announced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services. And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed.

In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience.

We will give you places to stay, but far from the capital.\"LUSE: When these efforts were first announced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services. And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation.

To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

We will give you places to stay, but far from the capital.\"LUSE: When these efforts were first announced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services. And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law.

Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on.

And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God.

It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah.

I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record.\n    \n KAROLINE LEAVITT: Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services. And if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away.

You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record.\n    \n LUSE: An encampment as defined by D.C.'s Department of Health and Human Services is an abode, such as a tent or unmovable structure, of one or more persons on public property or an accumulation of unmovable personal belongings that are present even when the individual is not. And while government officials suggest that clearing encampments supports public health and safety, they don't often get to the root of the issue.GOODRIDGE: You know, we have these sweeps. These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home?

Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

These are when law enforcement comes and tells unhoused people that they have to leave an area and go elsewhere.LUSE: That is New York City attorney and housing policy expert Leah Goodridge. She's also a tenant advocate and member of the New York city planning commission.GOODRIDGE: Either they can enter a homeless shelter if there's room. It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed. But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money.

And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

It doesn't mean that they're magically going to fly into a home. It just means that they're going to go to another location, probably in the same city, in the same neighborhood, just not there.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: The White House has said that more than 40 homeless encampments have been removed.

And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

But according to NPR's reporting, the encampment clearings have been rushed. And it's not clear where the homeless people have gone. And even though the city has opened more shelter beds, shelters aren't always the safest option.GOODRIDGE: What it all boils down to is they are uncomfortable seeing homeless people.LUSE: And the idea that people without housing shouldn't be seen or heard from, that didn't appear out of nowhere.GOODRIDGE: The U.S. has a history of dehumanizing homeless people. In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt.

The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

In fact, it was once unlawful for them to even be in public. In 1867, San Francisco enacted the unsightly beggar ordinance. And it made it unlawful for any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery.

It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record.\n    \n LUSE: Last year, she wrote an article in DAME Magazine titled \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment\" because she noticed that while homelessness is frowned upon publicly, it garners millions of clicks online.GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act.

And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record.\n    \n GOODRIDGE: I started seeing a lot of pranks involving either homeless people or people pretending to be homeless. For example, in 2023, there was a YouTuber, and he filmed himself buying a burger and handing it to a homeless man and then snatching it back to eat it in front of the homeless man, essentially as a taunt. Even in Spain - this isn't just limited to the U.S. - a YouTuber was sentenced to jail in 2019 for giving a homeless man an Oreo cookie that was filled with toothpaste instead of cream and that caused the homeless man to vomit.LUSE: These videos run the gamut from pranks to making homeless people dance for money. But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right?

They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

But according to Leah, this is just another version of poverty porn.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: A term from the 1980s that emerged from critiques of fundraising campaigns featuring malnourished children. Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story?

Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens.

And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income.

Leah thinks a lot of the content about homeless people online is just as exploitative.GOODRIDGE: The whole point of poverty porn is that the audience - you know, it's really about provoking or evoking a sort of emotion in the audience. And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

And sometimes it's to get them to give money. Sometimes it's to get them to be enraged. Sometimes it's to get them to feel empathy or sympathy. But it is evoking some sort of emotion, so it is a form of entertainment.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Today on the show, Leah Goodridge joins me to get into how our legal and societal narratives around homelessness create a culture that punishes and mocks people in need.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives.

They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God.

We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on.

I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah.

It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record.\n    \n LUSE: In your piece, you discussed poverty porn imagery. I wonder, how do you think poverty porn has evolved?GOODRIDGE: You know, one of the things I think about is the circus. The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right?

But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

The main people in the circus that they had there, who often have very little agency, were disabled people. And some of them were homeless as well. And the whole point of going to the circus for this entertainment was, like, look at this person who looks different from me. Look at this person who has a physical disability so that I can, like, pay money and be entertained by looking and mocking them. So that was also a form of poverty porn as well.I think what people get out of it is sort of looking and pointing and going, I'm not in their shoes. I'm not that. And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right?

And I think that when we are seeing the evolution of poverty porn, that's a big part of this. You know, people aren't watching this and going, hey, I'm going to donate money or, hey, I'm going to go and volunteer. That's not what's happening.LUSE: It sounds like you're saying that this kind of imagery is not - at least as it's kind of disseminated on social media, it's not getting people to act. It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

It's getting people to maybe feel nothing too much and kind of go on with their lives.GOODRIDGE: I would say it's more than neutral. I would say it's getting people to dehumanize homeless people. It's playing into the sort of normalization that they shouldn't exist - right? - because people are fine watching these videos online. When I say, OK, well, you know, what about getting them a home? What about a homeless shelter? Oh, I don't want a homeless shelter in my neighborhood. It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God.

It's going to lead to people hanging out.LUSE: With the concern for many people being that a homeless shelter nearby would bring an increase in crime and public...GOODRIDGE: Right.LUSE: ...Safety issues to their neighborhood.GOODRIDGE: Lots of people are the first ones lined up to protest and oppose it.LUSE: I wonder - it seems like so much of what makes this content click with people, so much of what is undergirding the kind of political dissonance that you just described, that you've seen in your work is this idea that homelessness is something that is very far away from their reality and something that's happening to someone else and something that is not supposed to be a part of their everyday lives. I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to.

So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God.

And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

I wonder, this kind of content and that kind of attitude about homelessness and homeless people that you've seen, how does that affect all of us?GOODRIDGE: Most people are not aware that they truly are one misfortune away from being homeless. A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane.

A lot of the folks that I've spoken with that are into the content demonizing homeless people are literally often one misfortune away. I mean, I've heard, probably at this point, literally thousands of stories of New Yorkers, and I would say some common threads that I heard - I was working a job, everything was fine, life was great, and then I got in an accident on the job. Or, I got in an accident, I became disabled and then I couldn't work. Or actually, the other big one was they let me go. They saw - fired me, and then it was hard to get another job. It was hard to work. I got another job, and then they said, you know, you have to stand up, or your (ph) back or whatever. And then I was let go again. I couldn't get back on my feet. My rent is going up.Remember, median Manhattan rent had hit at one point $5,000, right? And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

And so, you know, it's not like landlords are - when you have these life incidents that landlords are like, oh, OK, fine. I'll just lower the rent for you. No, that's not happening, right? And so things are moving, and then before you know it, your income is not keeping up, your disability checks are not keeping up. The family support is not there. And what family support looks like is literally paying your rent or having a place for you to stay if you don't have anywhere to go. The question we would have to ask people is, if you get evicted, do you have anywhere that you can go? And 100% of the time, you know, these people had a friend that they could stay with for a week.LUSE: Yeah. That's not a long-term solution.GOODRIDGE: It's not a long-term solution. At most two weeks, right? Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

Then I can tell you right now that changed drastically starting from the pandemic, and then it just became, I don't even have that. And then the support systems wane. And then that's it. Before you know it, you're evicted, you don't have anywhere else to go, you literally don't have anywhere to stay. I just want people to understand how easy it is. It's not like you go and you find a cheaper apartment in New York City. That's very hard to do.LUSE: A very hard - I'm always on the hunt for that. Trust me, it's very hard to do.GOODRIDGE: Very. You know? And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier.

And trust me, I've had clients where, you know, I'm like, OK, I don't know if this case is going to work out. So if you get evicted, do you have anywhere else to go? No. OK, let's try to find a cheaper apartment. They go out. They're like, I found a rent-stabilized apartment, but the broker is charging 15- to 18% of the annual rent. And then it's like, OK, so now you have these sort of, like, barriers before you can, like, access this apartment.LUSE: You have to have, like, sometimes tens of thousands of dollars on hand in order to be able...GOODRIDGE: Tens of thousands of dollars.LUSE: Yeah, to move in. Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people?

And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

Yeah.GOODRIDGE: Or I told them, I have Section 8, and as soon as I said that, their tone changed. They didn't say anything. They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is.

It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

They didn't say, oh, we don't take Section 8. They just never got back to me.LUSE: And you, of course, don't know exactly what was going through their minds when they responded in this way, but it was enough to give you pause.GOODRIDGE: Can I tell you a funny story? Try to find an apartment and then, you know, the question is, well, what do you do? Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law.

How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation.

Like, oh, I'm a lawyer, and they're like, are you one of those, like, civil rights, like, social adjustments...LUSE: Oh, really?GOODRIDGE: And then I'm like, oh, wait; it gets even funnier. And I'm like, no, I do, like, general law. And then I - this always happens. They Google me, and they're like, tenants' rights lawyer?LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, no.LUSE: They're like, it's the feds.GOODRIDGE: (Laughter).LUSE: She's got to go.(LAUGHTER)GOODRIDGE: So it's not great for us out here (laughter).LUSE: Yeah. I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people?

Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is.

But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

I mean, I've showed up on time with my now husband, called the person who is going to be showing the apartment who said that, you know, suddenly he couldn't be there, he wasn't going to be able to show up, only for him to then realize I was standing outside of his car window and could see him.GOODRIDGE: Oh.LUSE: (Laughter).GOODRIDGE: Oh, my God. Wow.LUSE: But he was waiting in his car in front of the building ostensibly to see what my husband and I looked like.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: He saw that we were two Black...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...People, and he thought...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...He wanted to stay there. So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation.

And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation.

But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law.

And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation.

But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law.

But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah.

So I did make him get out of the car and show me...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...The apartment (laughter).GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: At that point, I didn't want to see it. But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on.

To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on.

I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate.

But I did...GOODRIDGE: Yeah.LUSE: ...Want to ruin his day.GOODRIDGE: There was a lot of housing discrimination.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: But I imagine that trying to obtain housing after, you know, a period of homelessness - I can only imagine.GOODRIDGE: Yeah.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Coming up...GOODRIDGE: Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation.

However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article.

But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

But the question is, should the solution be punitive?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Taking that in while also considering, you know, the popularity of this kind of really dark and harmful content that you're describing online - I don't know - it makes me wonder, how have you seen the way that we talk about or represent homelessness online trickle down into your work?GOODRIDGE: I think one of the ways that I have seen this, you know, is when it's time to build housing, right? I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation.

I mean - and a disclaimer here - I sit on the Planning Commission, but I'm not here in that capacity. But one of the things I talk about frequently on the Planning Commission is that the housing that comes through when it's affordable, no one who is homeless or formally homeless or trying to leave being homeless can afford this. When I say, well, we need more housing for very low-income people, they do this whole, like, well, you know, if we're going to spend government money, there's already public housing. Why don't we have for middle income?And so I say, OK, well, we'll have for middle income, but also for very low income. And then they're like, well (laughter) - then we get to the meat of it, which is, like, a lot of people are fine with leaving out the lowest income. I'm a tenant advocate. I do a lot of community work, and I've had times where I've led workshops in so-called, like, low-income housing. They're like, OK, can you talk to them about not offering these empty units to formally homeless people?LUSE: That reminds me of something you mentioned in your article. To quote you, \"classism did not just stem from the wealthy to poor.\"GOODRIDGE: Right. I worked as a tenants' rights attorney for many years, and I represented low-income tenants. And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation.

And when I would talk about my work with everyone and anyone, I would hear the comments. And the biggest thing I would hear is, I understand that these people need help. However, I just went to my local grocery store, and I saw someone pull out their EBT card to buy lobster. And I was like, OK, and what does that have to do with housing? But they're like, well, what are people doing to leave this housing?LUSE: Basically suggesting that they're already getting government assistance and aren't doing enough to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, essentially.GOODRIDGE: And these are Black, lower- to semi-moderate-income people that I'm talking to. So I think that was my realization that the dehumanization of poor people, especially poor Black people, was really widespread. Sort of like, actually, no, people who receive government assistance shouldn't be able to buy soda or, like, whatever it is. And I know because I spent 12 years hearing these points...LUSE: Wow.GOODRIDGE: ...In all neighborhoods I can think of in New York City.LUSE: I keep thinking about the idea of homelessness being criminalized and homelessness and criminalization being so closely linked as a matter of circumstance and also, as you have discussed in this conversation several times, as a matter of literal law. It makes me think about something else that we're seeing happening in our country right now. You wrote an article last year titled, \"Unhoused People Are Not Entertainment.\" That was last year. And now, this year...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it.LUSE: How are you thinking about the impact of this type of rage bait online content about homeless people now?GOODRIDGE: Yeah. Of course, we need to have a solution, right? But the question is, should the solution be punitive? Should the solution be criminalization? Should the solution be simply sweeping people up off the street or threatening to arrest them? Or should it be, how are we going to house these people? How are we going to have permanent housing for these people? How are we going to address the root causes of homelessness?(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LUSE: Well, Leah, I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you so, so, so, so much. This is really important and so timely.GOODRIDGE: Thank you so much for having me on. I really appreciated it.LUSE: That was New York City attorney, tenant advocate and member of the New York City Planning Commission Leah Goodridge.And I'm going to put on my influencer hat for a second and ask you to please subscribe to this show on Spotify, Apple or wherever you're listening.

        "text": "Published Aug 25, 2025 at 06:00 AM EDT CEO of the FCB Radio Network  Donald Trump claims Washington, D.C., needs the National Guard to get crime under control. Every time he says it, the same argument flares up: who's to blame for crime in America's cities? Progressive commentator Ed Krassenstein argued online that crime is really a red state problem, pointing to higher murder rates in Republican states. Conservative commentator Carmine Sabia, a friend of mine, shot back that Democratic mayors are responsible since they run most of the big cities. They're both wrong. And this is exactly the problem with the way we talk about crime in America. Everyone wants to use it as a political football. The truth is much simpler, and much harder: crime doesn't follow party lines. It follows poverty. The federal government's own numbers prove it. In 2023, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that people in households making under $25,000 a year were almost three times more likely to be victims of violent crime than those in households making more than $200,000. That's not red states versus blue states. That's poor versus rich. The same pattern shows up when you look at neighborhoods. The National Neighborhood Crime Study found that violent crime rises as poverty rises, regardless of whether the neighborhood is white, Black, Latino, or mixed. Once poverty is factored in, the racial gap in crime shrinks dramatically. In plain English, a poor white neighborhood and a poor Black neighborhood have more in common with each other than either does with a wealthy neighborhood. Columbus, Ohio, proved this point. Researchers found that when neighborhood poverty climbed above 40 percent, violent crime spiked. It didn't matter whether the residents were Black or white. Poverty was the trigger. Cleveland shows how those conditions were created and sustained. A 2018 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland found that neighborhoods redlined in the 1930s are still the poorest, most crime-affected parts of the city today. Eight decades later, the legacy of disinvestment is still visible. And this isn't just about cities. Rural America tells the same story. Stilwell, Oklahoma, a small Republican-majority town, has a violent crime rate about double the national average. Nearly half its children live below the poverty line. The problem isn't who the mayor is. The problem is entrenched poverty. That's why the partisan finger-pointing rings hollow. Yes, some red states have higher statewide murder rates. Yes, Democratic-run cities record more murders in raw numbers. Both statements are true. Neither one explains the real issue. Now, crime policy isn't irrelevant. It matters. Progressive Democrats can be too lax when it comes to fighting crime, and that has to be addressed. You can't ignore the symptoms. But if you're only focused on policing tactics and never address poverty, you're treating the fever without curing the disease. We have to deal with both the symptom and the cause. And it's worth remembering that not every big-city Democrat even fits the caricature partisans like to paint. Many mayors and city council members are moderates who spend as much time fighting progressives as they do fighting Republicans. Yet in the national debate, they get lumped in with those progressives as if they all share the same ideology. They don't. What would actually move the needle is cooperation. Red state governors and blue city mayors should be working together to address poverty instead of using crime as a talking point. That kind of partnership—not endless partisan bickering—actually helps people. If we want safer streets, the only way forward is tackling poverty head-on: schools that work, jobs that pay, communities that are invested in instead of ignored. Because until we do that, crime will remain highest where poverty is deepest. And politicians will keep using it as a football instead of fixing it.

While the bill would be a boon to wealthy Americans, it would scale back resources for the nation's poorest households, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warned in a recent letter to lawmakers. In an effort to pay for an extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, Republicans in both the House and Senate want to change or reduce key social safety net programs that provide health care, food benefits and financial assistance for millions of children. Here's what to know. More than 37 million children are enrolled in either Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a federal program that provides affordable health insurance to pregnant mothers and children who live just above Medicaid's poverty threshold. Combined, Medicaid and CHIP protect nearly half of all children in the United States, beginning with important prenatal care, covering over 40% of U.S. births as well as nearly half of all rural births, and continuing to insure millions of vulnerable children into young adulthood. Congressional Republicans want to continue to allow states to impose waiting periods before families can enroll in CHIP and to lock them out of the program if they fail to keep up with premiums. They also propose changing Medicaid to include a first-ever national work requirement. As the House bill is written, it would exempt parents, \"but what we've seen from past experience with work requirements is that exemptions are not always effective,\" says Allison Orris, director of Medicaid policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Senate Republicans propose going even further, with a part-time work requirement including parents of children over 14. \"If [parents'] earnings go up because they're complying, that actually could be good for the kids,\" says Kevin Corinth, who studies poverty and safety net programs at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute (AEI). \"Because there is good research showing that, when parents work and we get more earnings coming into the household, that can improve current and future outcomes [for children].\" In addition to work requirements, Republicans are proposing other changes that would create new administrative hurdles for families, according to Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families. \"When there's more red tape, we know that it's harder for families,\" says Joan Alker, head of the center and a Georgetown research professor. \"To see these kinds of cuts is very, very scary.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson's office defended the changes in a press release, writing that \"Republicans are protecting and strengthening Medicaid for American citizens who need and deserve it by rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.\" He also claimed on NBC's Meet the Press, \"there are no Medicaid cuts in the Big, Beautiful Bill. We're not cutting Medicaid.\" Yet CBO estimates the House bill would cut federal spending on Medicaid by roughly $800 billion over the next decade, and the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation focused on improving health care access, estimates 1 in 5 children could be at risk of losing their Medicaid coverage if the House proposal goes into place. Alker says the House changes would force states to make difficult decisions about whether to cut services or raise taxes. \"Governors are gonna have to do the dirty work,\" she says. And the Senate's proposal, she warns, would be even harder on states. According to research by CBO, consistent Medicaid coverage in childhood increases earnings in adulthood, which increases tax revenue and can gradually repay the federal government for its early investment. In fact, CBO found, \"increasing children's enrollment in Medicaid would reduce the future federal deficit by between roughly $800 and $3,400 per child per year of enrollment.\" House Republicans have also proposed big changes to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, which, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, helps pay for groceries for more than 15 million children in the U.S. This bill would bring \"the deepest cut to food assistance in history,\" says Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for food assistance at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The House bill would expand SNAP's existing work requirements, though Bergh says \"research has repeatedly shown that this doesn't increase people's employment. It doesn't increase their earnings. It just cuts people off of SNAP and leaves them hungry.\" The House bill would also cut more than $290 billion from SNAP over 10 years – a cut Bergh estimates would \"eliminate or substantially reduce\" food assistance for more than 2 million children. And the House proposal could, for the first time in the history of SNAP, put states on the hook for between 5% and 25% of the cost of food benefits. Whether this shift in funding, from the federal government onto states, is a good idea is \"debatable,\" says AEI's Corinth, though he points to one potential upside: It could force states to have \"more skin in the game.\" One potential downside, according to CBO, is that some states \"would modify benefits or eligibility or possibly leave [SNAP] altogether because of the increased costs.\" And for children, losing access to SNAP benefits could hurt them in more ways than one, as they would also lose their automatic enrollment in free meals at school. In its analysis of the overall impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill, CBO estimates resources for the poorest households \"would decrease by about $1,600 per year,\" a loss \"mainly attributable\" to cuts in the social safety net, including Medicaid and SNAP. By contrast, CBO predicts the wealthiest households would see an average annual gain of $12,000. House Republicans hotly dispute CBO's math, with Speaker Mike Johnson claiming \"the biggest beneficiaries of this [bill] will be low- and middle-income Americans.\" Senate Republicans' proposal mirrors the House proposal in many ways, including a work requirement and significant cost-shifting onto states. Senate Republicans are proposing updates that could improve and expand access to a handful of tax benefits that help families pay for child care, including the Child and Dependent Care tax credit. \"Expanding child care tax credits in the Senate bill is a step in the right direction toward making care more affordable and accessible for families nationwide,\" Sarah Rittling, executive director of First Five Years Fund, said in a statement. Her organization advocates for affordable access to quality child care and early learning. Researchers and child policy experts are less supportive of proposed changes to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC). The EITC is essentially an anti-poverty program in the form of a refundable tax credit that AEI's Kevin Corinth points out provides low-income, working families with extra help. Congressional Republicans are proposing additional administrative hurdles that families would have to overcome to qualify. Namely, requiring that they go through an onerous precertification process for their children before being able to claim the credit. This additional step would be a burden not only on families but on the IRS, which has been the subject of severe staff cuts by the Trump administration. Then there's the current Child Tax Credit, which can lower a family's tax bill by up to $2,000 per child. House Republicans want to increase that to $2,500. But households have to earn a certain amount of income to be eligible for the full credit. Republicans are also \"making what is, in theory, a new higher credit much harder for families with children to actually receive,\" says Megan Curran, policy director with the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University. Current law requires children to be either U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents to be eligible for the CTC. The House bill could disqualify more than 4.5 million children, Curran estimates, because it would require both parents to have a Social Security number. The Senate bill would require that only one parent have a Social Security number for their child to be eligible. It's unclear how many children that change would still disqualify.  The bill would also continue current policy, blocking the lowest-income families from qualifying for the full tax credit. \"Under current policy, a two-adult, two-child family needs at least $36,000 [in income] in order to get the full [credit],\" Curran says. \"That's 1 in 4 kids nationwide who are left out of the full credit.\" On the other hand, wealthy households earning up to $200,000 for individuals, or $400,000 for couples, can claim the full credit.  This disparity would get even more pronounced if the credit grows, Curran says, with that two-adult, two-child family now needing to earn $48,000 to claim the full credit. \"As a result, under the House Reconciliation Bill, 1 out of every 3 children would be left out of the full credit nationwide,\" Curran says. Senate Republicans are pitching a smaller increase to the CTC, to $2,200, but the underlying machinery would similarly limit the benefit for the lowest-income households. Many countries employ some kind of child benefit for families, but Curran says the U.S. is unusual in that \"we exclude the families with lower and moderate incomes. And those are children who arguably could really benefit from this type of investment the most.\" In 2021, Congress briefly increased and expanded the child tax credit to include the nation's lowest-income families. The expansion was short-lived — just six months — but research shows it helped cut the share of children living in poverty by nearly half. Research shows investing in vulnerable children isn't just a benefit to them and their families, it also provides lifetime returns to the nation. \"Every dollar that you spend on the child tax credit in an expanded form that reaches all kids would return at least $10 a year,\" Curran says. That's because children would be healthier, she says, and do better in school. Later, they would get better jobs and pay more back into the system, in the form of taxes.

        "text": "The state, which has long ranked worst in the US for child wellbeing, became the first and only in the country to offer free childcare to a majority of families There was a moment, just before the pandemic, when Lisset Sanchez thought she might have to drop out of college because the cost of keeping her three children in daycare was just too much. Even with support from the state, she and her husband were paying $800 a month – about half of what Sanchez and her husband paid for their mortgage in Las Cruces, New Mexico. But during the pandemic, that cost went down to $0. And Sanchez was not only able to finish college, but enroll in nursing school. With a scholarship that covered her tuition and free childcare, Sanchez could afford to commute to school, buy groceries for her growing family – even after she had two more children – and pay down the family’s mortgage and car loan. “We are a one-income household,” said Sanchez, whose husband works while she is in school. Having free childcare “did help tremendously”. Around the same time, Ofelia Gonzalez and her sister began receiving assistance from the state to develop their at-home childcare center in south-western Albuquerque, called Mis Conejitos. The state started reimbursing their work at higher rates, which allowed them to buy toys and swings for the backyard, and raised wages for childcare workers across the state, which allowed Gonzalez to begin saving “so that I can have good credit and in time I can have my own home”, she said in Spanish. The changes in Sanchez and Gonzalez’s lives are intertwined. Three years ago, New Mexico became the first state in the nation to offer free childcare to a majority of families. The United States has no federal, universal childcare – and ranks 40th on a Unicef ranking of 41 high-income countries’ childcare policies, while maintaining some of the highest childcare costs in the world. Expanding on pandemic-era assistance, New Mexico made childcare free for families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level, or about $124,000 for a family of four. That meant about half of New Mexican children now qualified. In one of the poorest states in the nation, where the median household income is half that and childcare costs for two children could take up 80% of a family’s income, the impact was powerful. The state, which had long ranked worst in the nation for child wellbeing, saw its poverty rate begin to fall. As the state simultaneously raised wages for childcare workers, and became the first to base its subsidy reimbursement rates on the actual cost of providing such care, early childhood educators were also raised out of poverty. In 2020, 27.4% of childcare providers – often women of color – were living in poverty. By 2024, that number had fallen to 16%. During the state’s recent legislative session, lawmakers approved a “historic” increase in funding for education, including early childhood education, that might improve those numbers even further. “This is a big investment that we know is going to pay off,” said Elizabeth Groginsky, cabinet secretary of New Mexico’s nascent early childhood education and care department. She points to research from the Nobel-winning economist James Heckman that “every dollar spent on high-quality, birth-to-five programs for disadvantaged children can deliver a 13% per annum return on investment from better education and health outcomes for children, employment gains for parents, greater economic productivity and reduced spending on healthcare and crime. “The governor has seen that this investment in our human capital is as important as all the investments we’re making in our infrastructure,” said Groginsky. Despite the fact that widespread poverty has kept the state’s child wellbeing rates low, “New Mexico had, almost from statehood, a real culture around caring for children,” said Hailey Heinz, a senior research scientist and deputy director of the University of New Mexico’s Cradle to Career Policy Institute. Both Republican and Democratic administrations have never been “particularly stingy with the social safety net”, she said, citing the Democratic lieutenant governor, Diane Denish, who led efforts to offer free pre-kindergarten to all the state’s four-year-olds in 2005, and the Republican governor, Susana Martinez, who expanded Medicaid in 2013. After Medicaid was expanded in the state, a coalition of community groups came together to advocate for the next policy they thought could advance child wellbeing: universal childcare. When now-governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced her candidacy in late 2016, she emphasized her desire to address the state’s low child wellbeing rating. And when she took office in January 2018, she described her aim to have a “moonshot for education”: major investments in education across the state, from early childhood through college. That led to her opening the state’s early childhood education and care department in 2019 – and tapping Groginksy, who had overseen efforts to improve early childhood policies in Washington DC, to run it. Then, in 2020, Lujan Grisham threw her support behind a bill in the state legislature that would establish an Early Childhood Trust Fund: by investing $300m – plus budget surpluses each year, largely from oil and gas revenue – the state hoped to distribute a percentage to fund early childhood education each year. But then, just weeks after the trust fund was established, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. “Covid created a really enormous moment for childcare,” said Heinz. “We had somewhat of a national reckoning about the fact that we don’t have a workforce if we don’t have childcare.” As federal funding flooded into New Mexico, the state directed millions of dollars toward childcare, including by boosting pay for entry-level childcare providers to $15 an hour, expanding eligibility for free childcare to families making 400% of the poverty level, and becoming the first state in the nation to set childcare subsidy rates at the true cost of delivering care. “The governor saw this as an opportunity to accelerate and advance her agenda for children and families because we had the relief money,” said Groginsky. As pandemic-era relief funding dried up in 2022, the governor and Democratic lawmakers proposed another way to generate funds for childcare – directing a portion of the state’s Land Grant Permanent Fund to early childhood education and care. Like the Early Childhood Trust Fund, the permanent fund – which was established when New Mexico became a state – was funded by taxes on fossil fuel revenues. That November, 70% of New Mexican voters approved a constitutional amendment directing 1.25% of the fund to early childhood programs. By then, the Early Childhood Trust Fund had grown exponentially – due to the boom in oil and gas prices. Beginning with $300m in 2020, the fund had swollen to over $9bn by the end of 2024. The second greatest oil- and gas-producing state in the US, much of New Mexico’s state budget comes from fossil fuels. “It’s the blessing and curse of living in New Mexico,” said Gabrielle Uballez, executive director of NM Voices for Children. But while oil and gas is booming, she says advocates hope to “take advantage of that so that kids and families are benefiting – not the oil and gas industry by itself, and not corporations by itself”. New Mexico has long had one of the highest “official poverty rates” in the nation. But using a metric that accounts for social safety net programs – like universal childcare – that’s slowly shifting. According to “supplemental poverty” data, 17.1% of New Mexicans fell below the federal “supplemental” poverty line from 2013 to 2015 (a metric that takes into account cost of living and social supports) – making it the fifth poorest state in the nation by that measure. But today, that number has fallen to 10.9%, one of the biggest changes in the country, amounting to 120,000 fewer New Mexicans living in poverty. New Mexico’s child wellbeing ranking – which is based heavily on “official poverty” rankings – probably won’t budge, says Heinz because “the amount of money coming into households, that they have to run their budget, remains very low. “However, the thing New Mexico has done that’s fairly tremendous, I think, is around families not having to have as much money going out,” she said. During the recent legislative session, lawmakers deepened their investments in early childhood education even further, approving a 21.6% increase of $170m for education programs – including early childhood education. However, other legislation that advocates had hoped might pass stalled in the legislature, including a bill to require businesses to offer paid family medical leave. In her budget recommendations, Lujan Grisham asked the state to up its commitment to early childhood policies, by raising the wage floor for childcare workers to $18 an hour and establishing a career lattice for them. Because of that, Gonzalez has been able to start working on her associate’s in childhood education at Central New Mexico Community College where her tuition is waived. The governor also backed a house bill that will increase the amount of money distributed annually from the Early Childhood Trust Fund – since its dramatic growth due to oil and gas revenues. Although funding childcare through the Land Grant Permanent Fund is unique to New Mexico – and a handful of other states with permanent funds, like Alaska, Texas and North Dakota – Heinz says the Early Childhood Trust fund “holds interesting lessons for other states” about investing a percentage of revenues into early childhood programs. In New Mexico, those revenues come largely from oil and gas, but New Mexico Voices for Children has put forth recommendations about how the state can continue funding childcare while transitioning away from fossil fuels, largely by raising taxes on the state’s wealthiest earners. Although other states have not yet followed in New Mexico’s footsteps, a growing number are making strides to offer free pre-K to a majority of their residents. Heinz cautions that change won’t occur overnight. “What New Mexico is trying to do here is play a very long game. And so I am not without worry that people might give it five years, and it’s been almost five years now, and then say, where are the results? Why is everything not better?” she said. “This is generational change” that New Mexico is only just beginning to witness as the first children who were recipients of universal childcare start school. Sanchez urges other New Mexican families to take advantage of the opportunity to access free childcare. “Being able to work for free or go to school for free, that can make a big difference in your life and your children’s – everybody’s – life.”",

        "text": "In mathematics, you often have to deal with the problem of division by zero—an undefined gesture toward infinity. Charting the wealth gap between white and Black Americans over time poses a similar problem. It’s not that African Americans arrived with almost no property; it’s that they arrived as property themselves. The whole calculation is a category error. For two centuries—first under British rule, then under an American flag that proclaimed liberty and justice for all—Black people in the United States were enslaved. The Revolution’s soaring promises of inalienable rights and universal equality were never meant to include them. It took a civil war before African Americans were finally recognized as citizens. Only after the abolition of slavery does it become possible to begin a meaningful statistical series—and what it reveals is a yawning chasm. Legal equality was written into the Constitution in 1868, in what historians sometimes call the nation’s Second Founding, but the reality was more elusive. Reconstruction stumbled after Abraham Lincoln’s assassination and soon collapsed altogether. “The slave went free; stood a brief moment in the sun; then moved back toward slavery,” W. E. B. Du Bois wrote. This new form of subjugation was less overt, but no less deliberate. Poll taxes and literacy tests stripped away suffrage. Sharecropping turned freedom into a kind of feudalism. Jim Crow laws imposed rigid segregation, and lynching enforced it with terror. Even those who headed north as part of the Great Migration, in search of opportunity and relief, found themselves corralled into ghettos. And yet, during this long and harrowing period of state-sanctioned exclusion, the chasm began to narrow. Ellora Derenoncourt, an economist at Princeton, has documented this slow convergence. In 1860, on the eve of the Civil War, white Americans held fifty-six times the per-capita wealth of Black Americans. Within a decade, that ratio had been reduced to twenty-three to one. By 1920, it was ten to one. By mid-century, it was seven to one. The crowning legislative victories of the civil-rights era—the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act—came in the mid-nineteen-sixties, a full century after Emancipation. By then, the gap stood at roughly six to one. Discover notable new fiction, nonfiction, and poetry. At the apex of the civil-rights movement—after the assassination of John F. Kennedy but before that of Martin Luther King, Jr.—it was clear that legal equality, though hard-won, would not be enough. Cities remained rigidly segregated; the ghettos, now synonymous with concentrated poverty, simmered with unrest. In a 1965 article for Commentary, Bayard Rustin, the chief architect of the 1963 March on Washington, observed that the civil-rights struggle was evolving “into a full-fledged social movement . . . concerned not merely with removing the barriers to full opportunity but with achieving the fact of equality.” The trials that lay ahead, he warned, would be “of far greater magnitude than the legal barriers” that had just been torn down. The problems to surmount were structural: deindustrialization, entrenched segregation, economic marginalization—conditions shaped by Jim Crow, but not undone by its eclipse. To meet that challenge, Rustin, King, and A. Philip Randolph—the longtime leader of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters—drafted a bold proposal called “A ‘Freedom Budget’ for All Americans.” It was not a demand for reparations, nor was it framed explicitly in racial terms. Instead, it outlined a universalist expansion of the welfare state, grounded in the idea that economic justice could reinforce democratic citizenship. The budget’s principles called for increased investment in health care and education, the elimination of slums and ghettos, and, most ambitiously, a federal jobs guarantee. There would be, the men emphasized, “no doles,” no interference with private enterprise—the aim was only to give “the poor a chance to become dignified wage earners.” The Freedom Budget never became reality. What took shape instead were President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty and the broader suite of Great Society programs—a sweeping expansion of the American welfare state, though one that stopped short of the jobs guarantee that Rustin, King, and Randolph had deemed essential. Still, for a moment, there was the potential for a national effort at economic redistribution—an effort that, unlike the New Deal, extended its benefits across racial lines. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s legacy had left Black Americans behind. Social Security was designed to exclude domestic and agricultural workers—the majority of the Black labor force at the time. The newly formed Federal Housing Administration underwrote home loans that went overwhelmingly to white families. The G.I. Bill, heralded as a ladder to the middle class, was locally administered, allowing Southern officials to deny Black veterans the benefits that their white counterparts received. Johnson’s programs, by contrast, were meant to desegregate not just schools and lunch counters but government assistance itself. In 1965, speaking at Howard University, the President laid out what he called “the next and the more profound stage of the battle for civil rights”—a fight for “not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a fact and equality as a result.” The metaphor that he used has since become canonical: “You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, ‘you are free to compete with all the others,’ and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.” He didn’t use the term “affirmative action,” but the policy began there, in élite universities and in companies with federal contracts, and would persist, in one form or another, for decades. Sixty years on—after the expansion of the welfare state, after affirmative action, after the decline of legal segregation and the slow erosion of overt discrimination—you might expect the convergence to have continued. You might expect real economic parity to have come within reach. But the numbers tell a stranger story. The racial wealth gap today remains where it was in the nineteen-sixties: around six to one. The ratio hasn’t budged. What went wrong? Theories abound. One of the most persistent—and, to many, persuasive—is that racism never truly receded; it simply changed form. This is the core argument of “The Plunder of Black America: How the Racial Wealth Gap Was Made” (Yale), by the historian Calvin Schermerhorn. The book traces the fortunes of seven Black families across generations, excavating genealogies and tabulating, with forensic care, the labor extracted and the property lost. The result is a long historical arc of dispossession that culminates in a bracing indictment: “A nation founded, in large part, on ransacking African Americans’ work product . . . never gave up stealing. The last hundred years have been a nimble shift in that theft and wealth stripping. Intentional racism became an institutional reflex.” In this account, every apparent step forward is matched by a quiet reversion—each gain followed by a new, more elusive form of loss. Redlining gives way to “predatory inclusion” through subprime loans. School desegregation in the cities sparks white flight to the suburbs. The election of Barack Obama is answered by the rise of Donald Trump. Again and again, advancement is met by backlash, recognition by retrenchment. The diagnosis echoes the dark realism of early critical race theorists. “Black people will never gain full equality in this country,” the legal scholar Derrick Bell wrote in his classic “Faces at the Bottom of the Well,” from 1992. “Even those herculean efforts we hail as successful will produce no more than temporary ‘peaks of progress,’ short-lived victories that slide into irrelevance as racial patterns adapt in ways that maintain white dominance.” The permanent-racism hypothesis offers a compelling account for all the progress we haven’t seen. What it can’t readily explain is the progress we have seen. Since 1970, the share of Black children living in poverty has fallen from fifty-six per cent to sixteen per cent, according to researchers at Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy—an improvement attributable largely to the welfare architecture begun during the Johnson era. Residential segregation, too, has declined. The sociologists John Logan and Brian J. Stults, analyzing every decennial census from 1980 to 2020, found significant drops in Black-white segregation across American cities. (Notably, the five most segregated metro areas today—Newark, Milwaukee, Detroit, New York, and Chicago—are all north of the Mason-Dixon Line.) Not all the data are encouraging. The economists Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren, mining income-tax records to track twenty million children into adulthood, have shown that Black children face much higher rates of downward mobility than white children born at the same income level. Yet even here the pattern is not monolithic: the gap is almost entirely driven by Black boys. Black girls and white girls raised in similar economic circumstances show no meaningful difference in mobility. These complexities pose problems for the permanent-racism thesis. If the racial wealth gap is a straightforward product of systemic racism, how did it narrow during the height of Jim Crow, when racism was overt and institutionalized, and stall out after those structures were formally dismantled? Why is the mobility story for Black women so different from that for Black men? And why have other marginalized groups—Asian Americans and Hispanics among them—managed to accumulate wealth at a faster rate, despite their own histories of exclusion and discrimination? History paints a vivid picture, but without economic rigor it risks missing the frame. One might have hoped for a more searching explanation in “Black Power Scorecard: Measuring the Racial Gap and What We Can Do to Close It” (Metropolitan), a recent book by the Brookings scholar Andre M. Perry. There is at least some nod here to underlying causes of the racial wealth gap—differences in family formation and educational attainment—but the analysis is often hasty and uneven. Perry repeatedly asserts that “the thinking that education predicts wealth is misguided” because “wealth predicts education.” There is, no doubt, a strong correlation between family wealth and educational attainment. But one of the most consistently replicated findings in economics is that, even accounting for wealth, higher education itself leads to higher earnings. College graduates now earn, on average, at least eighty per cent more than those without degrees. To claim, as Perry does, that “education is not the great equalizer,” at a time when a significant racial gap in college completion persists, risks doing real harm. His reluctance to treat family structure as a causal factor is similarly puzzling. He notes that married Black households have an average wealth of two hundred and thirty thousand dollars—more than three times that of their unmarried peers—but resists drawing the obvious conclusion. The gap is not merely about differences in saving habits. Perry acknowledges that fifty-seven per cent of Black children do not live with their fathers, but hurries past the long-term consequences of that fact. A growing body of research in child psychology and economics links adverse childhood experiences—violence, instability, parental absence—to poorer performance in school, reduced emotional well-being, and lower lifetime earnings. In a paper titled “The Trouble with Boys,” the economists Marianne Bertrand and Jessica Pan find that boys in particular suffer most acutely: they are more likely to act out, fall behind, and fail to recover. Perry concedes that “there are economic benefits to marriage,” but cautions that focussing on it “diverts attention from eliminating the discrimination that extracts wealth and makes marriage less likely.” As with education, he treats wealth not as an outcome but as a precondition. Having decided that wealth disparity is the foundational cause of all others, Perry presents a remedy that’s scaled accordingly: a reparations program that could cost as much as fourteen trillion dollars. The proposal comes with a handful of other guarantees to Black Americans. “What is owed,” he writes, includes lower energy bills (facilitated in part by “the installation of programmable thermostats”) and “a single-payer system that provides universal care without significant cost sharing.” Link copied There are, to be sure, books on the subject that offer more rigor and depth. “The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap” (2017), by Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, is a sharp, historically grounded critique of the idea that segregated institutions—Black banks, in particular—ever meaningfully closed the racial wealth gap. “Black economic power and autonomy had a natural appeal in the face of segregation and racism,” she writes, but the strategy has been “an anemic response to racial inequality” and has yielded “virtually nothing” in terms of long-term convergence. Economic power, she argues, cannot thrive in isolation. Bank of America, she notes, began as the Bank of Italy, serving working-class Italian immigrants in San Francisco—its eventual success made possible by integration into the broader financial system. “Full racial integration will eventually remove pockets of blight, crime, and deprivation across the country,” Baradaran writes. “We must shed the destructive myths that separate can be equal, that a segregated economy will reach prosperity on its own.” Baradaran, like many others, ultimately endorses reparations, including in the form of direct cash payments. A similar line of reasoning appears in the legal scholar Bernadette Atuahene’s new book, “Plundered: How Racist Policies Undermine Black Homeownership in America” (Little, Brown). Drawing on legal analysis and deep ethnographic work, Atuahene investigates a quietly devastating episode in Detroit: the city’s illegal overassessment of property taxes in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. Thousands of poor Black homeowners—many living in the only properties that they had ever owned or stood to pass down—were driven into foreclosure. The result was a deepening of the already stark wealth divide between Black residents of the city and white residents of the surrounding suburbs. Atuahene adopts a definition of racism in the mold of Ibram X. Kendi’s: any policy or practice that sustains racial inequality. Though her study focusses on a single city, she insists that “predatory governance is an American problem”—one that operates quietly, bureaucratically, and often legally, across jurisdictions. Unless these policies are exposed and eradicated, she warns, the wealth gap will continue to fester, unnoticed but widening all the same. If you take these diagnoses seriously, reading them from the vantage of our current political moment is enough to invite despondency. Reparations, long proposed as the only measure proportionate to the scale of racial plunder, look increasingly like a political, economic, and legal non-starter. Donald Trump, now returned to the Presidency, would never sign such a bill. Republicans in Congress would never pass one. Even California, a wealthy blue state with a Democratic supermajority in the legislature, is balking at the anticipated cost of state-level reparations. The conservative majority on the Supreme Court, for its part, regards the Constitution as color-blind—an understanding that leaves little room for policies explicitly tied to race. Even a groundswell of political will seems unlikely to sweep these obstacles aside. In 2020, America underwent what many called a racial reckoning, sparked by the mass protests organized under the Black Lives Matter banner. But the effects, in retrospect, feel ephemeral. Many police departments that saw their budgets slashed have had those funds hastily restored amid a rise in violent crime. Corporate pledges to meet diversity targets and back D.E.I. initiatives have, in many cases, been quietly shelved—or publicly reversed—in deference to shifting political winds. Joe Biden, elected in 2020 on a platform that stressed racial equity, made little progress on that front. Trump was not merely reëlected in 2024; he won the popular vote outright, and doubled his support among Black voters, winning sixteen per cent. One begins to understand why pessimism has always been the shadow companion of critical race theory. Other perspectives from the social sciences offer more room for hope. William Julius Wilson, an eminent sociologist at Harvard, has long argued that the persistence of Black economic disadvantage is not solely a function of present-day racism but also the result of large-scale economic transformations that, while not racially motivated, have had racially disparate effects. The decline of American manufacturing, the rise of globalization, and the shift toward a service-based economy that disproportionately rewards college graduates have all contributed to the stratification we now see. To ignore these structural forces, Wilson suggests, is to misdiagnose the problem—and to risk prescribing the wrong solutions. Ellora Derenoncourt, the economist whose work traces the racial wealth gap back to 1860, has also studied why progress stalled in the past sixty years. Along with colleagues, she identifies three key reasons. First, income convergence between Black and white Americans largely halted. Second, Black wealth is held disproportionately in housing rather than in financial assets or businesses, meaning that stock-market booms—which have become a hallmark of the post-Reagan economy—widen, rather than shrink, the gap. Third, a persistent savings gap between Black and white households compounds over time. According to their models, unless these underlying conditions are addressed, even reparations on a vast scale would offer only temporary relief. “Within the next 30 years,” they write, “this gap would increase by 30%, and divergence would continue over time.” A separate study, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, reaches a similar conclusion. Analyzing returns on capital, intergenerational transfers, and wage trajectories, the study’s authors find that “equalizing earnings is by far the most important mechanism for permanently closing the racial wealth gap.” They also test the effects of a direct redistribution—basically, a helicopter-drop of wealth. The result? “Equalizing wealth without changing the earnings gap has no long-term effect on the wealth gap.” These findings complicate the dominant narrative that has taken shape in the past decade: that the Black-white wealth gap, built on a foundation of historical injustice, serves as a kind of permanent sentence. This view—widely circulated in works like Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “The Case for Reparations,” published in The Atlantic, in 2014; Richard Rothstein’s best-selling book “The Color of Law,” from 2017; and the Times Magazine’s 1619 Project, launched in 2019—holds that past policies of exclusion and dispossession, especially in housing, created a self-perpetuating cycle of inequality which can be broken only through proportionate intervention. The taproot of this story is often identified with the infamous redlining maps created by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, or HOLC, a New Deal agency established in 1933. According to this account, HOLC maps codified residential segregation, denying African Americans access to home loans and, in turn, the chance to accumulate generational wealth through property ownership. The solution, in this framework, is remedial state action commensurate with the original harm. But the historical record isn’t so clear-cut. The HOLC maps were not widely disseminated at the time, and the agency itself was relatively equitable in its lending. It was the Federal Housing Administration—established a year later—that proved more systematically discriminatory, encouraging lenders to use racial covenants and steering loans toward white-only suburbs. Still, during the thirty-three years between the founding of HOLC and the passage of the Fair Housing Act, in 1968, the Black-white wealth gap continued to diminish. Moreover, redlining was not uniquely applied to Black neighborhoods. Many of the areas assigned the worst rating—D, for “hazardous”—were filled with recent immigrants of Italian, Slavic, or Jewish origin. In a review of HOLC maps across seven cities, the urbanologist Alan Mallach found that, at the time they were drawn, the vast majority of residents of redlined areas were white ethnics. These communities faced discrimination and hardship, yet many of their children outpaced their parents economically. Recent work by the economists Leah Boustan and Ran Abramitzky shows that this pattern of upward mobility continues among the children of immigrants today, including those from poor countries like Guatemala and El Salvador. The contrast is telling. In 2007, Black and Hispanic families had roughly the same levels of median wealth. Fifteen years later, Hispanic wealth had doubled; Black wealth had risen by only half. A rejoinder to the project of decomposing the racial wealth gap into its constituent parts—the marriage gap, the business-ownership gap, the education gap, the income gap—is that each of these, too, is a reflection of racism, both past and present. To search for color-blind remedies is, therefore, a fool’s errand. As a theory of history, this is powerful; as a guide to policy, however, it’s frustratingly limited. Take education, one of the most powerful predictors of income. There is no question that separate and unequal schooling created vast disparities in educational attainment. But when today’s racial achievement gaps are attributed to more nebulous forms of discrimination—like implicit bias in standardized testing—the explanatory force begins to wane. The solutions that many voices for racial justice have espoused tend to be moral or psychological in nature: decolonizing curricula, reëducating teachers, raising public awareness of structural inequity. These measures are often abstract, and resistant to scale, let alone rigorous evaluation. Consider, instead, the possibility that many of the racial achievement gaps we observe today reflect not only race but class—the reality that American society is increasingly divided into islands of affluence and disadvantage. The evidence for this is growing. Childhood exposure to concentrated poverty has lasting effects, across time and across racial categories. It hinders cognitive development, educational attainment, and long-term earnings. These forces shape the lives of children on the South Side of Chicago and in Appalachian hollows, in Native reservations and in borderland colonias alike. And if concentrated poverty damages all children, then deconcentrating and reducing it should benefit all children. The means for doing so are already known. Expanding direct cash supports, such as child tax credits, has demonstrable effects (and even figures like Vice-President J. D. Vance have endorsed this). So does integrating neighborhoods, something that’s within the grasp of the politicians who run big American cities. But doing so would require loosening the zoning restrictions that choke new housing construction, and untangling the web of air rights, environmental reviews, noise ordinances, and traffic studies which keeps poor families penned in place. It would require something far less poetic than a moral awakening—just a shift in what kinds of barriers we choose to take down. It might seem almost too obvious to say that the wealth gap is, at bottom, an income gap. But that simple reframing clarifies a great deal. Wealth is a terminal indicator. It reflects not only the inheritance one starts with but the sum of a lifetime’s earnings, net of taxes and consumption. Yearly income differences, when compounded over decades, become chasms of accumulated capital. The well-off don’t just save more; they save differently. They move beyond housing into equities, retirement accounts, and business ownership—forms of wealth that, on average, grow faster than a home can appreciate. For families with lower incomes, that leap is rarely possible. It is also more plausible, practically and politically, to break the chain of intergenerational poverty—an absence of income which necessarily leads to an absence of wealth—than it is to forcibly level wealth itself. And we know more than ever about how to do this. Chetty, the economist, along with his collaborators, has identified features of neighborhoods that give poor children the best shot at upward mobility. Five stand out: low levels of residential segregation, low levels of income inequality, good schools, strong social capital, and high levels of family stability. Of course, there is little reason to expect the current Administration to turn its attention toward the elimination of child poverty or the narrowing of racial income gaps. But it does at least profess concern for the fortunes of working-class Americans. There is a faint rhyme between the newly created “Trump accounts,” which will provide newborns in the U.S. with a thousand dollars, and the progressive idea of baby bonds—investment accounts designed to grow over time into modest stores of capital. The reality, though, is that explicitly race-conscious strategies for economic convergence are off the table. Affirmative action has been thrown out in college admissions and hiring. Civil-rights law, for the foreseeable future, will be interpreted through the lens of constitutional color blindness. The equity-oriented initiatives of the Biden Administration are already being reversed. Even on the left, the appetite for social-justice rhetoric has cooled. There was political wisdom in the design of the Freedom Budget that A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, and Martin Luther King, Jr., proposed a half century ago: its benefits were meant to reach all Americans. Today, that wisdom is no longer optional. It is the only path left. ♦ In the weeks before John Wayne Gacy’s scheduled execution, he was far from reconciled to his fate.

        "domain": "abcnews.go.com",
        "text": "Social, economic and political conditions mirror those seen in the late 1800s. As economic inequality and wealth concentration rise, the U.S. is entering a new era of support for workers' rights, reminiscent of the Gilded Age. This historical period -- which ran from the 1870s and to the early 20th century -- saw rapid industrialization and significant wealth disparity, with a small elite growing rich while the working class faced poverty. Modern labor movements are at the forefront, increasingly challenging income inequality and drawing parallels to earlier struggles, keeping the fight for workers' rights alive. Just this week Boeing workers voted down a contract proposal from the company, choosing to strike until a better deal is made. From the elegant HBO series \"The Gilded Age\" to the glamorous 2022 Met Gala, the influence of this opulent era and its excessive fashion continues to shine. \"It's an age of unprecedented wealth, creation of amazing technological innovation, like the advent of electricity, electric lights,\" historian Edward O'Donnell told ABC News. \"We don't think of railroads as high-tech, but they were high-tech in those days.\" While the Gilded Age was marked by extravagance, O'Donnell noted that it was also characterized by feelings of uncertainty driven by the working class. \"The Gilded Age is very much a time of, sort of a tale of two kinds of America. One where things are going great,\" he said. \"And at the same time, there's a lot that people are saying we seem to be heading in a really dark direction.\" Similar to the Gilded Age, we're seeing unions battle big corporations, increasing concerns about wealth inequality and anxiety over immigration. With the upcoming election highlighting economic anxiety and an increasing number of billionaires in the U.S., some historians believe we may be experiencing a second Gilded Age. \"We did many things policy and law wise in the 1980s and '90s that changed the game, that changed our tax structure, changed – almost eradicated – deregulation of Wall Street and so forth, and so that the rules have changed in the favor of the super wealthy,\" O'Donnell said. Wealth distribution in the U.S. shows that the top 10% of households hold 62% of the country's wealth, compared to the 5.7% held by the bottom 50%. The combined net worth of the top five richest Americans on the Forbes list has reached an astonishing $840 billion. Extreme luxury is returning, which is evident in the increasing number of mega-mansions. Superyachts are also sailing worldwide, with some selling for hundreds of millions of dollars. Among them is the world's largest sailboat, owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Janelle Jones is the vice president for policy and advocacy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth and first Black woman to become the U.S. Department of Labor's chief economist. She said the current level of inequality is \"unsustainable.\" \"Over the past 45 years, CEOs have made over a thousand times more than a typical worker,\" Jones said. \"For the typical worker, the pay has only increased 24%. Last year, CEOs made more than 300 times the typical worker.\" Jones previously served as the chief economist and policy director at the Service Employees International Union, comprising 2 million health care and public sector members. She views the current strikes as a reflection of growing frustration. Although many question the effectiveness of unions, Jones believes they represent a sure path to better economic mobility. \"In occupations and industries where unions are strong. We see that wage workers are earning more money,\" Jones said. \"They have more access to benefits. We also see that inequality is less in these occupations and industries. It's less between men and women and it's less between races.\" Despite their efforts, unions often face significant criticism as some negotiations do not result in substantial pay increases or meaningful changes in the workplace. Additionally, newly formed unions frequently struggle to bring corporations to the bargaining table. Jones believes achieving greater wealth equality will require federal policy. \"After the COVID pandemic and the recession, we started to see the way that policy can make sure there's a floor for everyone,\" she said. \"We started to see the way that it can raise living standards for everyone.\" Jones' proposal resembles the changes that ended the Gilded Age. In the early 20th century, we began to see the first forms of labor laws, which introduced shorter working hours, eventually leading to the eight-hour workday and establishing workers' compensation. \"The economy is not some, you know, force that rises above us,\" Jones said. \"It's not something that dictates what we can do. The economy is for us. We make the rules, we set the parameters, and we know that we can change those rules if we need to.\" ABC's News Phil Lipof help contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

        "title": "A $1 million wealth gap now divides white families from Black and Hispanic ones, research shows",
        "domain": "nbcnews.com",
        "text": "  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The average wealth gap between white families and Black and Hispanic ones reached a new high in 2022, topping $1 million in household wealth, according to a new report.  New research by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic and social policy research, found that the average wealth of white families in 2022 reached a record high of over $1.3 million, compared to about $227,000 for Hispanic families and $211,000 for Black families. This report marks the first time the institute has recorded a seven-figure disparity in average wealth for both Black and Hispanic households. The median wealth for white families was $284,000, compared to $62,000 for Hispanic families and $44,000 for Black families.  “Inequities measured at the median will give you a better sense of the comparisons across typical families, but inequities measured at the mean will give you a better sense of the macro-level disparities in wealth accumulation in this country — generally, and by race,” said Madeline Brown, a senior policy associate at the Urban Institute. She added that both numbers are important to consider because they are the result of structural racism. “One million dollars in a gap indicates that we still have severe racial wealth inequity in this country,” Brown said. That lifetime difference in accruing wealth severely affects families’ ability to “buy a home, invest in their children’s college, invest in their children’s businesses, support their families,” she added. The report shows how racial and gender gaps in earnings, retirement savings and emergency savings can contribute to a lifetime lag for individuals and families. But homeownership is the primary driver of wealth-building in the U.S., the report said, and continues to lag for Black families in particular because of “the stubborn legacy of racist housing policies.” The average white homeownership rate has increased from about 64.9% in 1960 to 73.1% in 2022, according to the report, while Black homeownership has gone from 38.2% to 44.3% in the same period. Hispanic and Asian families both saw their highest recorded average homeownership rates in 2022, at 51.1% and 63.2%, respectively, but still lagged behind the rates of white families. The research also found that significant disparities continue in individual lifetime earnings between white, Black and Hispanic people. Data shows the average white man born between 1960 and 1964 earned $2.9 million over the course of his career, compared to less than $1.8 million for the average Black man and about $1.7 million for Hispanic men. The average white woman in the same age bracket earned $1.7 million over the course of her career, compared to less than $1.3 million for Black women and $883,000 for Hispanic women. “In a nation that professes that those who work hard and play by the rules should be rewarded with social and economic upward mobility, these persistent disparities are a stark reminder that, as a society, we have not achieved this goal,” the report said. The Urban Institute’s data comes largely from the Survey of Consumer Finances conducted every three years by the Federal Reserve. The 2022 survey was the first time data was disaggregated for Asian Americans, who had the highest average family wealth of any group that year at $1.8 million. Other data shows that household income varies greatly among Asian American groups. When it comes to solutions, the report proposes a series of policy changes to help close the racial wealth gap, including limits to the mortgage interest tax deduction and reparations for Black Americans. “Looking at that $1 million gap, reparations are, depending on how they’re delivered, a promising policy in bringing that gap down,” Brown said. “Because the history is such that these policies have compounded on themselves and created a situation where, overall, our wealth distribution in this country is incredibly inequitable.” Isabela Espadas Barros Leal was a former platforms editor and associate editor for NBC News Digital. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

By contrast, Black adults are more likely to give money to elders. Angela Chevaux and her husband have made a good living in York, Pa. She's an insurance claims supervisor and he's in construction. But still, a recent inheritance from her father-in-law has been life-changing. He left them a retirement account, a life insurance policy, an annuity — and her husband and his brother inherited an old farmhouse in a secluded spot with a pond. \"We were able to buy the property — the other half — out from his brother at a decent price,\" Chevaux says. She figures they paid about half what the appraised value would have been.  \n                A recent inheritance has allowed the Chevaux family of York, Pa., to pay down a mortgage and student loan debt.

That kind of generational wealth transfer is far more common for white families than for others. They're renovating the farmhouse to live in and are selling their own home, saying goodbye to 11 more years of payments. \"We'll be mortgage-free at [ages] 50 and 59!\" she says with a laugh. Her father-in-law also left Chevaux's 24-year-old son a money market account. \"He had given our son some money towards college before he passed,\" she says. \"So then this allowed him to pay off the rest of his college debt.\" Her son is a financial adviser and has invested the rest of his inheritance, with plans to use it to help buy a house. The family's financial fortunes show one way that America's stark racial wealth gap has persisted — and even widened — over generations. White adults are more than twice as likely as Black and Latino households to get sizable financial help from parents or other elders. That's according to a new poll by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Loading... Dorothy Brown, a tax law professor at Georgetown University, wishes more white families would talk about these intergenerational benefits. \"Because you have Black Americans who are doing everything they were told is right and not getting ahead,\" she says. \"And they're scratching their heads wondering, 'How come I'm not doing better than I am? How come I'm not doing better than the guy in the cubicle next to me?' \" The new poll finds 38% of white adults say they've gotten at least $10,000 in gifts or loans from a parent or older relative. Only 14% of Black adults receive similar gifts or loans. The share is 16% for Latinos and 19% for Native Americans. Brown says this divide reflects generations of segregation and racism, especially in housing policies. Racially restrictive covenants barred white people from selling or renting their homes to African Americans or other minority groups. And Federal Housing Administration policies supported such restrictions.   \"So if your grandparent got a home that was FHA insured, it was a result of their being white,\" she says. \"You don't think about that, but it was.\" The racial wealth gap is also evident in lots of other questions in the poll. \"When people talk about the American dream, it's here,\" says Robert Blendon, a Harvard professor emeritus of health policy who worked on the poll. A large number of Black, Latino and Native American adults say they want to move to better housing and expect their children to go to college, but they don't have the money to pay for those things. \"These minority communities are ... going to have to borrow everything in a very risky environment for that,\" Blendon says, \"and they don't have anything to at least help defray some of the costs.\" What's at stake, he says, is the ability to make the choices that can help families, and future generations, move ahead. For African Americans, especially, tax expert Brown says the generational wealth transfer is actually more likely to go the other way — children helping parents who suffered under Jim Crow. \n                Theodore Bailey and his wife, Audrey, live in Marana, Ariz.

He's among many college-educated Black Americans who provide extensive financial support to family, something research finds contributes to the persistent racial wealth gap because it diminishes funding for inheritances. That's the story of Theodore Bailey, who's 76 and remembers a tough childhood in segregated Nashville. \"My father died when I was 3 years old,\" he says. \"My mother was a single mother with four sons.\" His dad died while he was a military cook in World War II, which led to a major break for Bailey. As a war orphan he was able to go to college on the GI Bill, and that launched a successful career as an engineer and missile designer. From early on, Bailey sent money to help his mother get by. \"I knew she was struggling, you know. And at the time, I didn't have a whole lot to spare, but I'd send her whatever I could,\" he says. Now retired in Arizona, Bailey says he's always helped family. That includes supporting a brother who lost a job, sending grandchildren to college, and being there for others along the way. \"Oh,\" he says with a chuckle, \"there's always cousins and nephews and things that want to borrow money, and a lot of times they don't pay back.\" Research shows family help like this seriously depletes the wealth of college-educated Black Americans. Bailey says he's now having to cash out more of his IRA than he'd like to in this bad market, to meet his own expenses. He's not sure how much there will be left to pass on to his children and grandchildren. \"I invested in them, putting them through college and so forth,\" he says. \"I'm hoping they can take care of themselves.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

        "title": "Racial Wealth Inequality Stays High In A Strong Economy",
        "domain": "forbes.com",
        "text": "ByChristian Weller, Senior Contributor. Wealth is the difference between what people own and what they owe. It serves as a financial buffer in an emergency and as a means toward upward economic mobility. People can use their wealth to buy a new house, move if better job opportunities open up elsewhere and support their families’ education, among other things.  Yet wealth is distributed in highly unequal ways, especially by race and ethnicity, and those gaps show no sign of abating. This leaves Black and Latino/Hispanic households in financially more vulnerable situations and with fewer opportunities for upward economic mobility.   The Federal Reserve’s Distributional Financial Accounts show, among other things, total wealth by race and ethnicity – for Black, Latino and white households. This dataset also includes quarterly estimates of the number of households in each racialized population category. The data then allow for the calculation of the average per-household wealth for Black, Latino/Hispanic and white households on a quarterly basis from 1989 to 2023.  The wealth differences between Black and Latino/Hispanic households, on the one side, and white households, on the other side, stayed large through 2023. Black households typically have less than one-fourth of the average wealth of white households. By September 2023, the latest quarter for which data are available, Black households owned 23.5% of the wealth of white households. The average wealth of Latino households was less than one-fifth — 19.2% — of that of white households (see figure below). Black and Latino households thus face greater risks and less economic mobility than is the case for white households.  Average wealth heavily skews toward wealthier households. Median wealth — which evenly divides groups by wealth — better reflects the typical household’s wealth in each group. Data from the Federal Reserve’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances shows that Black and Latino households also have much lower median wealth than was the case for white households in 2022, the last year for which these data are available.  For instance, the median wealth of African Americans amounted to $44,900 or 15.8% of the median wealth of white households ($285,000) in 2022. In comparison, the median Latino/Hispanic household owned $61,600 in 2022, or 21.6% of the median wealth of white households. By either measure — average or median wealth — Black and Latino/Hispanic households face greater economic risks or fewer economic opportunities than is the case for white households.  Importantly, the gaps in household wealth by race and ethnicity show few signs of diminishing. Average wealth grew substantially for all groups during and after the pandemic. But the wealth gaps by race and ethnicity stayed fairly constant. The average wealth of Black households amounted to 23.7% of the average wealth of white households in December 2019, before the pandemic and its financial market disruptions started (see figures below and above). The average wealth of Latino households equaled 18.6% of the average white household’s wealth then. At least the racial and ethnic wealth gaps did not worsen, as they did during and after the Great Recession (see figures below and above), and as they have been since 1989.  Less wealth means fewer financial protections during an emergency such as a family member getting sick, someone getting laid off or a car needing repairs, among other events. Black and Latino households had on average much fewer liquid dollars on average than was the case for white households. In September 2023, the average Black household owned $24,288 in checking accounts, money market mutual funds and other liquid savings. This was 14.5% of the average amount of liquid savings of $167,234 for white households at the same time. The total liquid savings of Latino households stood at $25,299 or 15.1% of what white households owned (see figure below).  Median liquid savings were much lower one year earlier in 2022, as data from the Survey of Consumer Finances shows. The median amount was $2,010 for Black households, $2,000 for Latino households and $12,000 for white households. Black and Latino households regularly have to face an economic emergency with smaller financial protections than is the case for white households.  Households, especially Black and Latino families, needed to dip into their savings repeatedly when inflation increased in late 2021 and early 2022. Many households had built up savings thanks to stimulus checks — officially known as Economic Impact Payments — and other benefits such as expanded child tax credits (see figure below). But, by September 2023, those extra savings were largely gone, in part to cover higher costs and in part to buy a house amid rising prices. Black households on average had $6,556 dollars less in liquid savings in September 2023 than in December 2019. In comparison, Latino households had roughly the same amount then as they did before the pandemic started, while white households had 13.4% more – or $19,768 (see figure below). Black and Latino households are regularly in a much worse position to weather a financial emergency than is the case for white households.  Part of the decline in liquid savings likely came from some households using those funds as down payments for a house amid rising real estate prices. The homeownership rates of all racial and ethnic groups grew during the pandemic, census data show. By the third quarter of 2023, 45.5% of Black households and 49.4% of Latino/Hispanic households owned their own house, while this was the case for 74.5% of white households. These numbers show more widespread homeownership than in 2019, when 44% of Black households, 48.1% of Latino/Hispanic households and 73.7% of white households owned their own home. But, considering the trend in liquid savings, especially Black and Latino/Hispanic homeowners increasingly face more risks than white households do.  Household wealth has increased for all population groups during the pandemic. Pre-existing wealth gaps by race and ethnicity largely stayed in place during that time.  While some households gained access to homeownership, that upward mobility may have come with greater short-term financial risks. In other words, Black and Latino/Hispanic households had to choose between a short-term financial safety blanket and longer-term economic mobility and stability more often than white households did.

        "text": "  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time In the wintertime, the road outside of Rawnak Jahan’s home in Queens, New York, is often covered in ice and snow. For the 63-year-old Bangladeshi immigrant, leaving the house and trekking to the grocery store might seem daunting in itself. But with a recent back operation leaving her unable to walk, food access is even more complicated.  “I am not able to cook because I cannot stand for a long time,” she told NBC Asian America. “After 10, 15 minutes, I have to sit down.”  Jahan, who came to the U.S. with her two children in 2015, relies on the community organization India Home to bring meals to her door. It’s not just sandwiches and canned goods, but food that reminds her of what she might make at home.  Experts say the holidays can pose challenges for many in Jahan’s position, who have the need but don’t know where to turn for support. And a general lack of understanding about the wealth disparity that exists under the “Asian American” umbrella might keep resources out of their reach.  Asians in the U.S. have the greatest wealth gap of any ethnic group, according to a 2018 report by the Pew Research Center. Those in the top 10 percent of income distribution earn almost 11 times as much as those at the bottom, a disparity that rapidly took shape from 1970 to 2016.  The average household income for Asians in 2019 was around $85,000. But without picking it apart, that figure paints an incomplete picture. Indian families in the U.S., the highest earners under the umbrella, make $119,000 a year on average. Burmese families represent the other end of the spectrum, with just $44,000 a year coming in. Bangladeshis like Jahan, concentrated in New York, have a median household income of $59,500. But the $85,000 statistic is what gets the most traction, experts say, and that makes it so that government programs and charitable organizations are less likely to identify Asian communities to serve. In Los Angeles, a group of Asian Americans in business and law set up a holiday toy drive for this reason. “Those larger toy drives did not seem to be providing toys to AAPI communities,” said Diane Tan, one of the founders of the APA Holiday Toy Drive. “That’s when we thought, we should try to at least provide some toys to children of low-income families in our own communities.” The first one was held in 2000, with toys distributed to families through community organizations in their neighborhoods. Demand has only grown since then. “Last year, the need was the largest we ever had,” she said. With 2020 decimating Asian-owned businesses with a combination of racism and Covid, Tan says the number of families signing up for toy donations has spiked. Company and individual donations have helped meet that need, but it’s a hard ask for a local organization.  “A lot of families, their income level went down and they’re not necessarily able to afford buying toys,” she said.  The winter months in particular deepen food insecurity issues for lower-income Asians, according to community activists. There are several obvious barriers to entry, harsh weather conditions being one of them.  “They try to stay home and ration their food,” said Shubhra Datta, a case manager at India Home, which serves South Asian seniors in New York.  Of the 1,500 people who are members at India Home, 20 percent continuously experience food insecurity. Language barriers and lack of technology are two year-round hurdles that keep seniors from applying for programs like SNAP or food stamps.  “And then there’s people who have all those answers, but they can’t go outside, they can’t find the right type of food,” he said. “Most of them are from South Asia, they want food that’s South Asian, but it’s hard for them to find that.” For elders with mobility issues, leaving the house to go to food banks might be impossible, and when they get there, they might be met with goods they don’t recognize. India Home tries to fill that gap by providing multiple free meals per week, consisting of rice or chapatis, halal meats, dal and a vegetarian dish provided by local restaurants.  “That is where you really help them feel seen, help them feel like they’re being treated with respect, with empathy,” said Deepti Sharma, who has worked in community food access for years.  Considering culture when providing meals is just the human thing to do, she said.  “The most important thing I wanted to accomplish was making sure people don’t feel like they’re getting a handout,” Sharma said. “But when you give them a bag of produce, it’s like they’re taking home something they can provide for their family. Now they can go home and cook a meal.” India Home also takes into account health issues that are common to seniors, using brown rice instead of white rice so the meals are more nutrient-dense. Beyond keeping them fed, the good food also helps their mental health. “If you’re well fed, you tend to forget a lot of other things,” Datta said.  Jahan misses Bangladesh; her husband still lives there and visits the U.S. only a few times a year. But she says she’s found her community here now. Before the pandemic shut down most in-person activities, she would write poems and recite them to other seniors at India Home. Even confined to her house, she still talks to those friends on the phone regularly.  “They made me welcome,” Jahan said.  Sakshi Venkatraman is a reporter for NBC Asian America. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

        "title": "The Growing Wealth Gap Can Be Overcome With Some Help From Pensions",
        "domain": "forbes.com",
        "text": "ByDan Doonan, Contributor. One of the defining challenges of our time is the growing problem of economic inequality in the United States. In 2021, the top ten percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent in 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent dropped correspondingly over that period, while the bottom 50 percent (some 63 million families) owned only about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021. Not only does this economic inequality create hardships for families, experts agree that it is fueling discontent and political polarization in America.   As income and wealth inequality have spiked dramatically during the past forty years, advocates, researchers, and policymakers spanning the ideological spectrum have offered explanations on causes and potential solutions. But one counterweight to increasing inequality that hasn’t received as much attention is defined benefit pension plans. A new report provides a first-of-a-kind analysis on just how important pensions are in reducing wealth inequality.  Closing The GapGPS, jointly issued by the National Institute on Retirement Security and the UC Berkeley Labor Center, examines the role of pensions in providing adequate income to retirees analyzed by race, gender, and educational attainment. It also focuses on the role of pension plans in creating retirement wealth for workers.  Pensions Dramatically Boost Wealth, Especially for Blacks and Latinos The wealth-building effect of pensions is important, but often overlooked. When thinking about households accumulating wealth, it’s typically thought of as owning stocks or a home, but not the value of a retirement plan like a pension. In fact, a retirement plan often is one of the largest financial assets of many households. Thus, it’s important to consider the impact of pensions in closing the wealth gap. The new report finds that including the value of pension income in household wealth boosts the typical (median) net worth of older families substantially– a whopping 36 percent. The power of pensions is even more substantial for older Black families. Pensions increase their median net worth by a staggering 86 percent, with public pensions providing more than half of this impact. And for older Latino families that historically have been underrepresented in the public sector, pension benefits increase their median wealth by 32.4 percent.  While other research has noted that pension plans tend to lessen the degree of inequality in the U.S., this report is the first to assign specific numbers to the large wealth impact of pensions. But the findings come as pensions are on the decline in the private sector, leaving Social Security and public pension plans as the two remaining protectors of retirement security for middle-class families. This is especially true for Black workers, who have found public sector employment to be a pathway to the middle class due to the history of occupational segregation in the U.S. While defined benefit pensions remain common in the public sector, legislative changes in recent years have led to plans with tiers with less generous benefits, the establishment of hybrid plans that include both pension plan and defined contribution (DC) plan components, or a choice between a pension or a DC plan. As the impacts of these changes are more fully felt in future years when more workers begin retiring under these new plans or tiers, the inequality-dampening effects of public pension plans may decline somewhat. In the meantime, the economic impact for today’s retirees is more significant than most people realize, as public and private sector pension benefit payments in 2020 exceeded $600 billion nationwide. Pensions Also Boost Wealth for Women and Those Without a College Degree  Closing the Gap also shows the importance of pension plans for women and those without a four-year college degree. The report finds that public pension income is distributed more equally by gender than private pension and 401(k) income, which reflects different employment patterns by women. In addition, retirees fare better economically with a pension regardless of educational attainment, with the largest improvement among those without bachelor’s degrees.  Closing the Gap uses 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) as a helpful benchmark to assess the poverty-alleviating impact of pensions. And this impact is profound. Across all retirees, a significantly larger share of U.S. retirees with pension income were above 200 percent FPL in 2018-2020 (91%) compared to retirees without pension income (60%). Retired Black women, Latino men, and Black men were twice as likely to have incomes above 200 percent FPL if they had a pension. Those with no college education, but who have a pension, were 73 percent more likely to be above 200 percent of the FPL than those with no college education and no pension. And those pension benefits translate into meaningful retirement income. Those with a high school degree or less, but who had a pension, had $169,000 in pension wealth - significantly more retirement resources than typically seen among this group of workers.  Social Security and pensions, supplemented by 401(k)s and personal savings, supported the retirement security of the American middle class for decades. While these programs continue to provide substantial retirement income for retirees today, they face stiff headwinds. Social Security faces funding challenges, pensions are no longer widely available to private-sector workers, and 401(k) plans are underfunded except for the highest income workers. For most families, 401(k) savings and Social Security just won't provide sufficient retirement income, and the problem is even worse for women, Blacks, Latinos, and those lacking a college degree.  Thanks to this important new analysis, we now have data that for the first time shows the power of pensions for addressing a major economic and political problem facing the U.S. - economic inequality. Clearly, pensions play an outsized role in closing the growing wealth and retirement gap. Perhaps policymakers should place a higher priority on making pensions more widely available to working Americans. Not only would pensions improve working Americans’ financial outlook, but the reduced stress also could play a significant role in addressing the social discontent that is ailing the nation.",

Leandro Lozada/AFP via Getty Images CLIMATEWIRE | Climate change is expected to exacerbate social inequality in the United States and put millions of people at risk of severe financial distress, according to a new report from the Treasury Department. The findings, released Friday, focused on two sets of data. Using county-level climate projections through 2045, the Treasury Department determined that about half of all U.S. counties face “elevated exposure” to one or multiple climate hazards including wildfire, extreme heat and flooding.

Treasury officials then overlaid that information with data about each county’s “social vulnerability,” which takes in account more than a dozen factors including poverty, health conditions, race and ethnicity. The result: About 1 in 5 U.S. counties are both socially vulnerable and highly exposed to natural disasters. It’s a combination that has the potential to “compound existing inequities and cause disproportionate financial strain,” according to the report. As one example, the report looked at the Appalachian region of the eastern United States, which is more likely to flood as the planet warms. In addition to the climate threat, residents in that part of the country often have reduced access to health care services and “more limited employment opportunities,” the report says. Taken together, “households in this region may struggle to manage expenses if flooding events result in reduced working hours, or damage or destruction of household property,” wrote Treasury officials. Appalachia isn’t the only region at risk. The report highlighted similar problems in the southwestern United States, which is exposed to wildfires, and the Mississippi Delta, which is vulnerable to spells of extreme heat. High temperatures can be especially dangerous for Americans with less wealth. “Lower-income households often lack access to air conditioning, which may make them more susceptible to heat-related illnesses,” the report said. “Additionally, households in the Mississippi Delta are more likely to include older adults and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. These households may experience financial strain from added healthcare and utility costs.” The dual threat of climate impacts and social vulnerability isn’t a new problem. But policymakers say it’s an issue that deserves a robust response. “We know managing financial risk is not a new challenge, especially for low income and underserved communities who are often extremely sophisticated budgeters,” Suzanna Fritzberg who serves as a deputy assistant secretary at the Treasury Department, said Friday during an event hosted by the Urban Institute. “But it is an emerging risk, it is complex,\" Fritzberg added. \"It has both near-term and long-term challenges.\" The report comes more than two years after President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to consider the financial threats of climate change. That has resulted in a range of actions from the Treasury Department, including working with a council of top financial regulators to examine how natural disasters and the transition away from fossil-based energy could affect the global financial system. The agency also has called on property and casualty insurers to provide ZIP-code-level data about climate-fueled financial risk, and it more recently released principles meant to streamline financial firms’ climate commitments. Even so, more work needs to be done. The report outlines several examples of how climate impacts or disasters can affect household finances. That includes an interruption of income, particularly for outdoor workers in industries such as agriculture, tourism and construction. Floods and wildfires can also be devastating for families who do not have the savings required to quickly repair their homes. Those scenarios are made worse, Treasury argues, by the fact that many households are both underinsured and face high insurance premiums — further cutting into their savings and leaving their homes unprotected. Also notable is that in the wake of a disaster some households turn to loans or credit cards to cover costs — and struggle to make payments on existing debt. That can increase their likelihood of default, an outcome that can have a long-term impact on credit scores and access to money. “That was really our goal with this report, was to try to really put the granular household-level focus on some of these broader events where we see the macro-level impacts and the costs, but understand how it really reflects in people’s day to day lives,” Graham Steele, Treasury’s assistant secretary for financial institutions, said Friday.

Edward Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University, said¬†Asian Americans¬†have higher incomes and much lower poverty rates than White Americans, which drives up their median wealth.\n     \n            The growth in wealth for typical Black and Hispanic households provides them more financial stability, Ana Hern√°ndez Kent, senior researcher at the Institute for Economic Equity at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said¬†on October 20.\n     \n            This means¬†‚Äúthese families are better able to weather a future downturn,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo, it‚Äôs extremely positive.‚Äù\n     \n            Overall, however,¬†Kent¬†called the changes in¬†wealth¬†between 2019 and 2022¬†‚Äúa mixed bag‚Äù because of the ‚Äúincredible amount of wealth inequality in the US.‚Äù\n     \n            The median wealth of White and Black Americans¬†has¬†now surpassed their earlier peaks,¬†which were¬†prior to the Great Recession, Wolff said.\n     \n            Hispanic households‚Äô median¬†net worth¬†had already hit a record in 2019 and has since¬†continued to rise.\n     \n            The growth in housing wealth ‚Äì a home‚Äôs market value minus any outstanding mortgages or loans secured by the home ‚Äì has fueled the¬†overall¬†rise in net worth among Black and Hispanic Americans, in particular,¬†according to the¬†Fed survey.\n     \nSoaring home prices¬†in recent years have boosted homeowners‚Äô equity.

        "title": "The Rich Are Getting Richer – But Is The Wealth Gap Worse In Europe Or The US?",
        "domain": "forbes.com",
        "text": "ByImperial Business Insights, Contributor. Over the last 50 years we’ve seen a trend. Wealth is growing, there’s no doubt about that. In the year 2000 for instance, Forbes estimated there were just 470 billionaires in the world, owning $898 billion collectively. Fast forward to 2021, and Forbes’ annual rich list named 2,755 billionaires, with the top six collectively earning more than all 470 billionaires from the 2000 list combined.  When you flip the coin however, though wealth is soaring for many, there’s a far larger number of people whose circumstances are getting worse. The cost-of-living crisis, as well as soaring inflation, is causing many people’s real wage to drop significantly. The picture is the same across the pond in Europe too. In the UK, the number of people seeking help to feed themselves and their families through food banks has increased from 26,000 in 2010, to more than 2.56 million in 2022. At the same time, the cumulative wealth of the top ten billionaires in the UK has grown from £48 billion in 2009 to £182 billion in 2022 - an increase of 281 percent. Clearly the gulf between rich and the poor has become much more pronounced. Wealth inequality is a hugely important issue for governments and policymakers, but the current evidence makes long-term country comparisons difficult, and doesn’t help us to clearly understand the reasons behind such stark differences in wealth inequality trajectories.  With my colleague, Thomas Blanchet from the Paris School of Economics, we gathered all the necessary data to build the first Distributional Wealth Accounts for Europe. Our intention was to compare wealth inequality between Europe and the United States over the last five decades.  Having built the database, we started our research by analysing the evolution of aggregate wealth – which is defined as a person’s total assets and investments net of liabilities. We calculated the ratio of each country’s household net wealth to national income. This ratio indicates whether individual countries in Europe and the US are becoming richer or poorer.  We then explored the differences between Europe and the US by focusing on three key drivers of wealth accumulation: differences in savings, wages, and capital gains - of which the profit from property sales forms a key part. So, what were the results? Europe has experienced (slightly) faster growth in aggregate wealth compared to the US  We found the evolution of aggregate household wealth (relative to income) was similar in Europe and the US, steadily increasing from three times the national income in 1970 to five times the national income in the US and six times the national income in Europe in 2018.  The reason why the wealth to income ratio was slightly higher in Europe than in the US is mainly due to a bigger decline in house prices in the US during the global financial crisis.  The evolution of wealth among the wealthiest one percent of the population tells a different story  However, when we analysed the evolution of the top one percent wealth share in each of these regions, we found that, while Europe experienced moderate growth, the growth in the US was significantly higher. In other words, the gap between rich and poor in the US became much more pronounced. This was true whether compared to the European average or any single European country.  How can we explain these differences? To examine the drivers, we ran simulations that substituted the labour income inequality and asset price trajectories from France into the US figures. We found the US wealth concentration levels were lower because of the smaller rise in labour income inequality and the larger rise in house prices relative to financial assets in Europe. This would benefit middle income individuals more, as they have a larger share of housing in their portfolio. The results were similar when we substituted the same figures from other European countries into the US data.  Our research leads us to make three calls to action for policymakers:  1. Job market policies are crucial to reducing wealth inequality  We have shown labour income inequality has been an important factor behind the growing gap between rich and poor in the US. Controlling unemployment and designing policies aimed at boosting wages at the lower end of the market must be a priority if wealth inequality is to be reduced.  2. Central banks must play a key role in stabilising house prices  Since housing is an asset that has a disproportionate impact on middle income individuals, it is important prices are stabilised to prevent financial crises and the rise in wealth disparities.  3. Official institutions need to collect more and better wealth data Our research has made some progress in understanding the differences in wealth inequality trajectories between Europe and the US. We know much less about the evolution of wealth inequalities in the emerging and developing world. To design policies aimed at mitigating the rise of wealth inequalities, we first need to understand the levels and trajectories of wealth disparities within and across countries. If governments do not address the wealth gap with equitable policies and inclusive growth, more people will suffer from rising economic inequality.

As euphoria on Wall Street catapults stock prices to new heights, Main Street is in crisis. \n     \n            Nearly 8 million Americans have joined the ranks of the poor since June, according to researchers from the University of Chicago and University of Notre Dame. More than 27 million adults were in households that “sometimes or often” experienced a lack of enough food to eat within the last seven days, according to a Census survey.\n     \n                    The worst alternative is that one side or another says this isn’t my country anymore. This isn’t my population.”\n                 \n                    Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio\n                 \n            At the same time, the 2020 election – and President Donald Trump’s efforts to undermine the results – have further deepened political wounds.\n     \n            “I’ve studied the last 500 years of history and cycles and these things repeat over and over again,” Dalio said. “Large wealth gaps with large values gaps at the same time as there’s a lot of debt and there’s an economic downturn produces conflict and vulnerability.”\n     \n            The interview was conducted last week before Dalio’s 42-year-old son was killed in a car crash. \n     \n            “My family and I are now mourning and processing this and would prefer to be incommunicado for the time being,” Dalio wrote in a LinkedIn post. “We know that the terrible pain we are feeling has been and continues to be felt by so many others so our sympathies go out to them.”\n     \n            Dalio, who started Bridgewater Associates in 1975 and now serves as the hedge fund’s co-chairman, urged political leaders to find middle ground to address the nation’s unsustainable inequality problems.\n     \n            “In order to bring the country together and not have a form of civil war…there has to be the bringing of the country together – but in a smart way,” Dalio said. \n     \nRelated article\nFive stark measures show rising American suffering as Congress stalls on aid\n \n            Despite speaking in such stark terms, Dalio stressed that he doesn’t want Americans to “panic.” Instead, he’s trying to make clear to voters and leaders that compromising with political opponents may be difficult, but it’s not the worst outcome. \n     \n            “The worst alternative is that one side or another says ‘this isn’t my country anymore. This isn’t my population,’” he said. “That’s when the cause that people are behind is more important than the means of resolving their disagreements. That’s a threatening situation. History has shown that to be the case.”\n     \n            For months, leaders in Washington struggled to agree on what should have been a slam dunk: another round of federal Covid relief that would prevent benefits from lapsing for millions of Americans.\n     \n            The impasse finally ended late Monday as the pandemic intensifies, slowing the economic recovery and accelerating layoffs. \n     \n            A staggering 885,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits according to the most recent weekly report. Major companies including Coca-Cola, Disney\n            \n                (DIS) and Post-It maker 3M have announced mass layoffs. Nearly 13 million adults, or 9.1%, are not current on their rent or mortgage payments, or have slight or no confidence they will be able to pay next month’s housing bills on time, according to Census data. \n     \n            And yet parts of the US economy are booming. Housing is on fire, tech companies are minting money and stock prices have never been higher. \n     \n            “This Covid-19 crisis has both made worse, but also just pulled the covers off of the extraordinary inequity in our society and around the world,” Rajiv Shah, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, told CNN Business in a recent interview. \n     \n            “We’ve seen wealthy families and communities do quite well through the digital acceleration and high asset values that low interest rates and loose monetary policy have enabled,” Shah added. “And we’ve seen working families in America and around the world suffer dramatically.”\n     \n            Dalio said the United States must tackle its inequality problem head-on by investing in the future. He emphasized the need to boost productivity by improving healthcare, infrastructure and especially education.\n     \n            “If we don’t have broad productivity and employment, which comes from education and jobs programs and such, then we’re going to have a continuation and worsening of the great polarity, and I think that’ll be a problem,” he said. \n     \n            As an example, Dalio highlighted the fact that some students don’t have access to computers or high-speed Internet.\n     \nRelated article\nMajor CEOs signal Covid vaccine mandates could be on the way\n \n            “Not having connectivity today and not having a computer is like not having water or electricity or a telephone 50 years ago,” he said.  \n     \n            Of course, investments in education and infrastructure cost money and the United States is already grappling with massive budget deficits.\n     \n            Dalio, whose net worth Forbes pegs at nearly $17 billion, has often expressed support for raising taxes on the rich. \n     \n            “It’s a complicated question because as you raise that tax, you want to do it in a smart way that also doesn’t drive money into the wrong things,” Dalio said. \n     \n            Although Dalio didn’t back a specific tax rate, he said it’s “got to be well-engineered and it’s got to be more.” \n     \n            Still, the billionaire stressed that radical changes will have to come to the US system – sooner rather than later: “There is a polarity and a debt situation and circumstances,” he said, “in which there probably will have to be revolutionary-type changes.”\n     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

        "title": "American Wealth Is Broken",
        "domain": "theatlantic.com",
        "text": "My family is a success story. We’re also evidence of the long odds African Americans face on the path to success. Wealth is a number, sure, but it’s also a feeling. I grew up living with my mom and maternal grandparents, while my dad played and coached in the NBA. For a time, our family’s safety net was held together by my grandfather’s HVAC business, but in 2001, it nearly came apart. That year, the company worked on a project performing mechanical-contracting work at Lincoln Financial Field, the home of the Philadelphia Eagles. The timeline did not account for delays. My grandfather estimates that the company lost $4 million on the project. Our house was put on the market shortly after. I loved that house because it felt like home, but also because it made me feel at home in a predominantly white world, where I felt as if my every move was on display. The house served as a symbol of wealth to justify belonging. When we sold it, I felt exposed, as though my family was showcasing the fragility of black wealth for all to see. I told friends that my family wanted to downsize. I’m sure they saw through the lie. Americans are uncomfortable talking about money. We use careers, homes, and clothing to stand in as proxies. Certain markers in these areas signify wealth, regardless of the actual amount in your bank account. I harbor no delusions about how privileged my family and I are. As an adult, I am thankful every day for how much my family sacrificed for my freedom. But I also know that, as a whole, black wealth is delicate, because for generations lawmakers and power wielders attempted to prevent African Americans from building it. When I set out to write this story, I wanted to better understand the intricate narratives that make wealth in the black community so complex. My own understanding was rooted in the idea that while my family represented a version of the American dream, the injustices that have kept black families without a safety net for generations still reverberated throughout our history. I found those historical echoes still ringing in the stories of other families, too. A raft of policies responsible for building the American middle class destroyed opportunities for black people to build intergenerational wealth. According to 2013 data from a paper by the progressive think tank Institute for Policy Studies, if the average wealth held by white families magically stopped growing, it would take 228 years for the average wealth held by African Americans to catch up. When researchers from the institute looked at median wealth from 1983 to 2016 (adjusting for inflation), black families saw their wealth decrease by more than half, while white families saw theirs rise by 33 percent. While white families have a median wealth of $171,000, black families have a median wealth of just $17,600. These relationships aren’t fixed. Once you get a certain amount of wealth, keeping it within your family is much easier. It took until 1976 for the government to introduce the generation-skipping transfer tax, which was instituted to stop individuals from avoiding federal estate taxes by leaving money to their grandchildren. In 2010 (when the estate and generation-skipping taxes were briefly repealed), an estate could again escape paying those taxes on its fortunes. In Donald Trump’s 2019 State of the Union address, he praised himself for raising the estate-tax exemption to $11.2 million, which resulted in, the Tax Policy Center estimates, taxing less than 0.1 percent of estates (or about 1,900 households). America’s tax system protects the wealth that already exists, instead of the wealth that might exist if more families were in a position to build it. That my grandfather built enough wealth to get us into that house but not enough to keep it is partially a result of how much the cards have been stacked against African American wealth-building for generations. When World War II ended, my grandfather was only 6, but the discriminatory distortions of the GI Bill are still visible in our family’s financial history. His father, aunt, and uncles were World War II veterans. Four of them were able to secure coveted government jobs. While this may have given them stability, it did not help them build long-term wealth to pass along. White veterans, however, were encouraged to go to college, where they graduated with degrees in subjects such as engineering, according to research by the journalist Edward Humes. Even though 49 percent of black veterans (compared with 43 percent of white veterans) took advantage of some sort of education or training offered through GI Bill benefits as of 1950, that didn’t always mean a college degree. Most African American veterans who exercised their education benefits after World War II ended up pursuing vocational training, as counselors who approved the benefits steered blacks into low-paying jobs or historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). At the time, HBCUs were underfunded and did not offer engineering programs. Short on space, they were forced to turn away up to 50,000 black veterans. Humes also pointed to a survey of 6,000 job placements in Mississippi during the fall of 1946: 86 percent of the skilled, professional, and semiskilled jobs went to white veterans. My grandfather joined a union in 1956. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Act into law, policy makers drafted it to exclude agricultural and domestic workers, so black people made up less than 1 percent of union members. Black workers continued to struggle for equal treatment in unions: 31 affiliates of the American Federation of Labor explicitly excluded black workers at one point. Membership was nonetheless an important stepping stone for my grandfather. He gained entry only after his grandmother, a maid, persuaded her boss, the entrepreneur Charlie Willard, to hire her grandson. Willard helped him earn union membership and later made my grandfather a crew foreman. He got assigned to run the crew for Pennsylvania Hospital’s first professionally air-conditioned building. As my grandfather tells it, the hospital quickly poached him, offering him a full-time job and eventually promoting him to a position with a salary of $35,000. Eventually my grandfather wanted more than a steady paycheck. Although he may not have thought about it at the time, he wanted to build wealth. So he started a side hustle installing air conditioners for restaurants, bars, and colleges. He branded white trucks with his name and hired a crew to help him fulfill orders while he was at the hospital. When the hospital discovered his other business, his boss gave him an ultimatum: his side hustle or his full-time job. He chose the side hustle. He recalls union companies early on working with their friends to secure low prices from suppliers, blocking him from getting projects. My grandfather’s story is one of success (this year his business turns 50) that also illustrates why black success is used to claim that the playing field in America is more level than it actually is. My grandfather made it, but does his success against all odds mean that it’s okay when everyone else faces those same odds and fails? A black family’s success story is reassuring proof that the system works. If my family could successfully climb upward, the argument goes, then the ones who can’t aren’t trying hard enough. They don’t have enough grit. But successful black people are also treated as extraordinary. Why? Because Americans know the system is broken. Selling our home served as a personal paradigm shift. Whereas before I felt confident of my place in the world and my ability to keep climbing, afterward I felt my risk tolerance crumbling. I began to see my family’s story in the context of a larger history of a system that unfairly advantages white families at the expense of black ones. So I went to college and studied practical subjects instead of pursuing a passion. I landed jobs after college meant to build wealth, instead of pursuing writing or jobs in publishing, industries that privilege the children of wealthy families who can afford to subsidize young workers in low-paying entry-level jobs. My family, despite their struggles, gave me the means to choose differently. Even so, my initial choices highlight the complicated nature of black success: It’s knowing that as you rise, you have a responsibility to make sure your family and community rise with you. For better or worse, American wealth is a family affair. Part of what I struggled with growing up is that my dad’s profession is the archetype of black wealth and success. I remember overhearing a classmate once saying something along the lines of “Rich black people play sports.” This idea about what professional sports means conflicted with the reality of a limited generational safety net. My dad still works in the NBA, coaching for Oklahoma City. He guards his emotions as well as he used to guard other players, and I recently flew there hesitant to have a frank conversation about money and, more specifically, what it was like for him to go from the South Side of Chicago to a world of success. We sat in the living room, his dog, Bailey, lying by his side, the television muted in the background. It was a high-pressure time in the season, and I was nervous that he wouldn’t want to delve into the past. But as he did, I came to understand how inaccurate it is to assume that people deemed worthy as “making it” step into one world while leaving behind their own personal history. Maurice Cheeks grew up in Chicago’s Robert Taylor Homes, once the largest public-housing development in the country; it’s now gone—the last building was torn down in 2007. The development opened in 1962, housing up to 27,000 people despite being planned to hold less than half of that. By 1975, 92 percent of the families relied on government assistance. My grandmother was well known around the building she lived in. She used to belt out my dad’s and uncles’ names to get them to come inside as soon as the streetlights turned on. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros once said, “I don’t know of another place in America where there are 15 shootings and five killings over a weekend.” My dad’s general feeling was that you lived your life as best you could. “It was rough,” my dad told me. “But we didn’t really think about it at the time.” My dad will be the first to say that he did not make it out on his own. His basketball career started because a friend won a basketball scholarship to West Texas State (now West Texas A&M University) and told the coach that he would accept only if the coach also took my dad. (The coach has said that he also recognized my dad’s talent). In 1978, my dad was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with a starting salary of $30,000. Today that income would be worth roughly $123,000, or just less than the mean salary for a pharmacist. My dad was making money, but at a salary that did not go as far as the public perception of professional sports portrays. It was another example, like my maternal grandfather’s story, that “making it” is not the same as freedom through wealth. Read: Why black families struggle to build wealth One cannot talk about closing the wealth gap in any meaningful way without acknowledging that middle- and upper-class black families have lost and are still losing wealth because African Americans were ushered into segregated neighborhoods and denied the same benefits extended to white Americans. As soon as my dad started earning a salary, he sent much of it back to my grandmother, who continued living in the Robert Taylor Homes when he first started playing in the NBA. Research shows that my dad’s experience is typical for black people who have family members in need. The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the world’s longest-running longitudinal household survey, began in 1968 with 18,233 people, and now spans four generations or more. According to data from the 1994 PSID analyzed by Darrick Hamilton from the Ohio State University and Ngina Chiteji, now at New York University, 36 percent of middle-income black families’ parents lived in poverty, compared with 8 percent of middle-income white families’ parents. When Hamilton, Jermaine Toney (a National Science Foundation postdoctoral research fellow at Cornell University), and William A. Darity Jr. analyzed 2013 PSID data, they found that the parents of middle-income black families were more than eight times as likely to face poverty as the parents of middle-income white families. The mean net worth of black grandparents in the sample amounted to $56,713—for white grandparents it was $357,831. Those family ties may add up to an unending drain on the financial resources of anyone who makes it. Hamilton and Chiteji found that family circumstances, in general, are responsible for middle-class black families having 27 percent less wealth than their white counterparts. Hamilton and Darity wrote, “Inheritance, bequests, and in vivo transfer account for more of the racial wealth gap than any other behavioral, demographic, or socioeconomic indicator.” In other words, most people at the top of the wealth ladder are not there because of grit. More likely, the government or a family member helped lift them up—by paying for their education, or giving them a loan, or helping with rent. Wealth doesn’t just add lift. It ensures that when you fall, you land softly. We landed softly because my mom and her parents had something to sell—our house—when my grandfather’s business took a wrong turn. I also had support from my father. But that’s what makes us different. We’re more like the typical upper-income white family than the typical black one. The economist Raj Chetty and three other researchers found that a black child born to parents whose income is in the top quintile has roughly the same likelihood of falling to the bottom quintile as remaining at the top. White children, however, are about five times as likely to stay at the top when born there than they are to drop to the bottom. Those researchers were looking only at the power of income in that part of the study. But it stands to reason that wealth helps, too. A middle-income white family is more likely to be wealthier and own their home than a black family at the same place on the income scale. If you land a plum job at Google or Goldman Sachs, staying affluent will be a lot easier if your parents have already paid off their mortgage than if they’re still writing rent checks in public housing. Critics will argue that people who don’t climb upward when receiving help from welfare programs are taking advantage of the system. Welfare programs, however, are not one size fits all. Each program is intricately woven with the biases of policy makers, and rarely helps families build long-term wealth. As was the case with the Robert Taylor Homes, the site selection itself was designed to maintain segregation: In 1950, the city-council aldermen approved sites only in the “black belt,” instead of on the vacant land in white areas initially proposed by the Chicago Housing Authority. None of this is made easier when your family doesn’t know how to talk about money. Fluency in the language of intergenerational wealth is an advantage passed down along with the money itself. When my dad left the Robert Taylor Homes and started earning a salary, he didn’t know what to do with it. “The accountant came and asked me why I wasn’t cashing my checks,” he told me. “I used to hide my checks under my mattress when I started making more money.” Most Americans cannot expect one job to drastically alter their financial position. The thesis of the American dream is that consistent hard work pays off over time. But what if playing by the rules is still not enough to maintain wealth through multiple generations? What if the rules are stacked against you? I met Wendy Jones in December after learning about her mother, Josephine E. Jones. According to Wendy’s research for her book about her mom’s life story, An Extraordinary Life: Josephine E. Jones, Jo Jones may have been the first black woman in management at a Fortune 500 company. Wendy grew tearfully excited when talking about her mother—the words couldn’t come fast enough. She has meticulous files documenting her mother’s life, which she carefully showed me in the back of a restaurant near her home in New Jersey one late winter afternoon. She wants her mother to be remembered not only for breaking new corporate ground, but as someone who aimed to help her family and her community achieve whatever they wanted—including wealth. When Jo purchased a historic brownstone home in Harlem, her goal was to leave it to Wendy. What she ended up leaving Wendy was money, not wealth—for reasons that have everything to do with why many black Americans still do not feel free in this country. Read: Getting to the bottom of Americans’ fascination with wealth Jo was born in 1920 in South Carolina—her father was a sharecropper. At 26, she traveled north and started working as a cook for wealthy families, often being required to stay past midnight to wash dishes and take care of the families’ children. In 1953, Jo paid $100 a month in rent, which was twice the gross median rent in the New York metro area, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, but the best a black woman with a child could do. In 1951, Jo got a job working for a temp agency supplying cooks and maids to homes and companies. She received a two-week assignment to work for Standard Brands, a packaged-goods company, that ended up lasting 31 years, after the company hired her and eventually promoted her to run the employee cafeteria. When Wendy graduated from college, her mother handed her a folder full of notes from a course on home buying and told her to help them find a permanent place to live. In 1975, Wendy found a listing for 137 West 122nd Street in The New York Times—a house designed by the architect Francis H. Kimball, with original woodwork, stained-glass windows, and five original gas-burning fireplaces. Jo walked through the doors and knew she was home. When she tried to apply for a loan, the loan officer at Citibank (known at the time as First National City Bank) admitted that the bank did not lend mortgages in Harlem. So Jo persuaded the seller to agree to a purchase-money mortgage instead, essentially taking out a loan straight from the seller instead of a bank. Jo even agreed to cover the seller’s property taxes for that quarter after the owner wavered on the decision to sell. All of this took place even after redlining had been officially outlawed in 1968, with the passing of the Fair Housing Act. During redlining, the Federal Housing Administration, which insured private mortgages, considered whether black people lived in a particular neighborhood when making its insurance decisions. In “The Case for Reparations,” Ta-Nehisi Coates writes, “Neither the percentage of black people living there nor their social class mattered.” Black people were denied traditional mortgages. White families bought homes, moved to the suburbs, and gained equity, while black families were largely prevented from increasing their wealth through homeownership. By 1970, black people made up 92.2 percent of central-Harlem residents. Jo established a spring cleaning to rid the neighborhood of debris, and later led a task force to rid the neighborhood of drugs. She fought to register her house—which became part of a historic district—on the National Register of Historic Places in order to secure the only loan she could get. (A spokesman for Citibank said it does not keep records of its lending practices going that far back but is committed to fair lending practices.) Jo’s tenacity brought her many things, but financial security wasn’t one of them. In 1984, Jo alleged she was forced out of her job because of her age. With advice from her former boss (having a person in your corner who is comfortable challenging authority helps), Jo filed a lawsuit against her former employer, which was settled out of court. Jo was also offered only half the severance of employees in other departments.The loan had helped her repair the exterior of the historic house, but the interior was still not yet restored when Jo left her other job, in 1989. When Jo got sick in 2006 she couldn’t safely stay in the house. Her pension from work was half of what she got from Social Security, and was not enough to cover the cost of care. Jo’s job as a cook came with long hours and zero benefits. She was employed for five years as a domestic worker without being eligible for Social Security: When Social Security was created in 1935, agricultural and domestic workers were excluded, causing 65 percent of African Americans to be denied benefits. Social Security encompassed multiple programs, at least some of which were explicitly created to hurt black people. While drafting Title I (a program administered by the state to elderly in need) of the Social Security Act, southern members of Congress “did not want to give authority to anyone in Washington to deny aid to any state because it discriminated against Negroes in the administration of old age assistance,” Edwin Witte, the executive director of Roosevelt’s economic-security committee, wrote in his memoir. Toward the end of her life, Jo had no assets beyond her partially restored home. Wendy sold the home in 2008 after moving her mother to New Jersey, closer to where Wendy lived with her partner and son. Wendy and Jo split the proceeds from the sale, with half going toward Jo’s medical and assisted-living bills, Wendy told me. Then, Wendy’s partner lost his job, and her half of the house money was almost all they had left to live on. “Even when you get a windfall, it’s not like you can invest it, because you have to make sure everything doesn’t fall apart on your day-to-day life,” Wendy said. Wendy’s windfall—half of the $1.4 million the house sold for—was more than most families, black or white, will receive at any one point in their lifetime. The more telling number, though, is what Wendy chose to give up. When I asked Wendy for details of the sale, she unveiled a striking detail: Despite the house being in what is now one of the most desirable markets for Manhattan’s single-family homes, Wendy chose not to list 137 West 122nd Street on the open market. As her mother’s legal guardian, Wendy knew that Jo would have wanted a black family to own the home, and Jo’s neighbors had offered to pay the appraisal price. For high-priced New York real-estate assets, a seller may get significantly more than the appraisal price on the open market. Wendy’s decision is not surprising to me: Because homeownership was denied to many black families for decades, something larger than money is at stake when it comes to selling a home. Jo’s lifelong quest was to build up the black community around her; letting the market decide the next occupant of the home would have been to put the power back into the hands of the invisible policy makers whose legacy of redlining had left her without a mortgage in 1975. Wendy’s decision was characteristic of black philanthropy in general: tangible, specific, and focused on immediate impact. Philanthropy in the black community has a long history of building wealth for the group at the expense of the individual, even if that doesn’t maximize one’s tax advantages. Starting in 1969, in a memorable example, members of the Black Panther Party fed thousands of children free breakfast before school, hoping to keep kids full so that their minds were free to learn. The program helped form the basis of a federal food program in schools. Instead of tax breaks, members of the party were beaten and killed. A more congenial example comes from David Bennett, the vice president of development and alumni relations at Howard University in Washington, D.C., one of the nation’s HBCUs. The Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, recently donated $100,000 to the school, he told me. In order to donate the money, churchgoers gave up eating out, buying coffee, and going to the movies for 21 days. The funds, Bennett said, helped 34 students, who otherwise wouldn’t have been able to afford tuition, graduate. HBCUs continue to carry a heavy burden to educate the black community: Howard graduates more African American students who go on to pursue science and engineering doctorates than Harvard, MIT, and Yale combined. Yet, according to a Wall Street Journal report analyzing 2017 data, HBCU graduates have a median debt that’s more than 30 percent higher than that of graduates at other public and nonprofit four-year schools. Parents of HBCU students borrowed an average of roughly $14,000 in federal student loans to help pay for the 2017–18 academic year. The neighbors to whom Wendy sold the house kept it for 10 years, but, she said, weren’t able to make the necessary renovations to rent it out. Wendy sees the house as an effort geared toward building intergenerational wealth. “Now, at least, the family has the funds for the education of their young people,” Wendy emailed me. “So, indirectly, my mother helped another black family have wealth to pass on, and their children will go on to do good in the world and help others.” The house sold in 2018 for $2.2 million. Derrick Darby is the first and only black tenured professor in the University of Michigan’s philosophy department. I first learned of Darby after reading a profile of his department chair, Elizabeth Anderson, in The New Yorker. Anderson is known for arriving at moral theory by thinking about how the world actually works. She said Darby was recruited to Michigan because his work fits that mold, allowing people to connect normative issues with the realities of contemporary injustice. I went to Ann Arbor to talk with Darby about the practical realities of policy proposals such as reparations or a wealth tax. What I found was evidence of why Darby is very much the exception, rather than the rule, in the false meritocracy of a nation founded by slaveholders. Darby’s journey is rife with the often overlooked details of everyday life that shape the nuances of wealth in America. Darby grew up in New York City’s Queensbridge Houses, a public-housing development that is now the largest in the country. It has birthed some of the greatest hip-hop artists of our time, such as Nas and Mobb Deep. Success for Darby was never about a number in his bank account. It was about getting out of the projects. When Darby was growing up, he dreamed of escape. “I used to think about being a superhero, because that was going to be my way out,” he told me. “I’d get some superpowers and I could be strong … I could help my mother.” Darby talked about trying out different exit routes. Basketball? No, he wasn’t going to be in the NBA. Boxing? He got punched, instantly had a splitting headache, took off his gloves, and walked away. But Darby was inquisitive; he hung out with older kids and a group of ex-convicts in the neighborhood. They used to call him “Little Socrates.” It was the ex-convicts, people Darby looked up to because they made it clear that their path was not the only path, who told him to focus on knowledge as a means of escape. He just as easily, however, could have absorbed another message. Despite being labeled by a teacher as a good student in the third grade, Darby was suddenly considered a problem in the fourth. Darby remembers changing his little sister’s diapers before going to school. The cycle of being saddled with child-care responsibilities and being punished for not doing well in school took its toll, and he struggled to stay focused on his education. Making it past fourth grade proved crucial: Subsequent teachers reinforced his third-grade teacher’s message and invested in Darby, buoying his path through high school and, along with a guidance counselor, helping him with college applications until he was accepted to Colgate University. Once at Colgate, his philosophy professor latched onto his talent and encouraged him to pursue his doctorate. When Darby talked about policies such as universal child care, he said they’re not just about helping parents. Policies such as that would help alleviate the responsibilities that can fall on children when families are strapped for resources. Academia still plays mostly by the old rule books. Scholars are comfortable citing traditionalists. Try asking “What is injustice?” instead of “What is justice?” in philosophy, Darby said, and you’re viewed as breaking from custom. Philosophy represents the type of discipline where the system may still not be built to accommodate the diversity it claims to want. “On the one hand, because of the recent push for diversity in the discipline black philosophers are novelties; yet on the other hand, their race threatens the white male homogeneity that has traditionally characterized the discipline,” writes Jameliah Shorter-Bourhanou, an assistant professor of philosophy at Georgia College. Quayshawn Spencer, a philosophy professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says that 66 percent of tenured or tenure-track black philosophers are the only black philosophers in their department, according to 2013 data. Michigan will soon go back to having zero tenured black professors: Darby has accepted an offer from Rutgers University to be the Henry Rutgers Professor of Philosophy and direct the soon-to-be-created Social Justice Solutions Research Collaboratory. Philosophers are known more as thinkers than as earners. With Darby’s new position, however, the two may coincide: He will be joining one of the top philosophy departments in the country. Darby’s trajectory may not have begun with the explicit goal of building monetary wealth. Rather, it was important for him to do what he loved and build wealth along the way. Both of those opportunities were nearly taken from him when he was up for tenure at another university. Darby showed me a letter from a colleague in the philosophy department, detailing why the university should deny Darby tenure. (I reached out several times to the professor who wrote the letter for comment, but did not receive a response. The university declined to comment.) The letter questioned his ability to teach graduate students and suggested that many scholars who reviewed his research were biased. “It was an attack on me,” Darby said. He believes the letter partially meant to suggest that any support he had within the university and beyond was driven by racial sympathy, instead of the strength of his ideas. The professor titled it “Department Minority Report,” a typical name for a dissenting document that goes against the committee’s majority vote, but perhaps a cruel reminder when you are one of the few people of color among your colleagues. At the end of the review process, Darby was denied tenure. Darby filed an appeal and later learned the contents of the letter. He also hired a lawyer out of his own pocket, no small thing on his entry-level academic salary. A ruling conceded that there had been “unusual procedures” and offered Darby another chance to be reviewed. But Darby declined, and instead accepted a position elsewhere. “At the time, it was really difficult, knowing that they changed the rules,” Darby told me. “You climb this ladder—but then, when we start climbing that ladder and we get into those spaces, the rules change.” Darby knows that he is one of the lucky ones. He could see how someone who had not been in a position to challenge the tenure ruling may have ended up leaving philosophy altogether. For Darby, the system eventually worked. For others, without the right network or funds, it fails them. There is a supposed right way to be black in America: You’re encouraged to live in certain neighborhoods; you must make certain sacrifices for the sake of education. When I was younger, I railed against these constraints. Money only complicated the picture. In time, I came to understand that the image money creates stands in for all the things we don’t say about who gets to be free. As a child, I found refuge in my house and all it stood for. As an adult, I understand how much of my family history was wrapped up in that simple feeling. Even the black families who make it to the top are still facing the headwinds that knocked African Americans back down the path for so long. While the Americans who self-identify as “middle class” but hold the majority of the wealth in the United States—“the 9.9 percent,” in Matthew Stewart’s memorable phrase—debate private versus public school or whether to remodel their kitchen, upwardly mobile black families continue to overcome a history of oppression with their eyes toward wealth as a reconciliation of the freedom long denied. “Making it” is not merely an end point. It is so much more than that. Wealth has become an animating issue in the 2020 presidential election. Take Senator Elizabeth Warren’s proposal for a wealth tax. Under Warren’s plan, according to an analysis by the UC Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the wealthiest 75,000 households in the United States would be subject to payments of 2 percent of their net worth above $50 million and 3 percent of their net worth above $1 billion every year. Warren says the resulting revenue would be enough to cover her proposal to cancel student-loan debt for 42 million Americans and provide a free public-college education. (She would also provide funding for HBCUs.) The wealth tax represents a step toward federal recognition that people don’t succeed on their own. But her proposal, and those like it, hint at the symptoms, not the cause. They do not address the fact that once you graduate from college and land a job, your wealth is still in the hands of others (your boss or even a colleague, as the case may be). Or that if you don’t wish to go to college and instead want to pursue a bold business idea, your freedom to do so depends on your parents’ ability to support you. This means different things for black and white Americans. Put another way: Believe for a moment that the world’s Googles and Amazons had been invented in garages, as their founding myths assert. Would companies like that exist if failure meant living in the projects instead of a middle-class garage? What we need is a formal reconciliation with the way wealth is built and maintained. To put the freedom of choice created through wealth back into the hands of the people who have had that freedom denied to them for far too long. How do we do that? I’m not sure there’s an easy answer. Read: The racial wealth gap could become a 2020 litmus test Arguably the most important act of reconciliation took place at a college graduation in Atlanta this spring. Robert F. Smith, an investor and the wealthiest black person in the United States, said he would pay off the student-loan debt of the graduating class at Morehouse College, an HBCU. Smith told the graduates, “True wealth comes from contributing to the liberation of people, and the liberation of communities we come from depends upon the grit and the determination and the greatness inside of you.” What struck me about Smith’s gift, compared with other philanthropic efforts or policy arguments, was this: He put the power of choice back into the graduates’ hands by acknowledging the shared history of African Americans. I grew up with the freedom to choose because my family overcame incredible odds. In fact, maybe I have that freedom only because they dared not to follow a conventional path. It is this friction that was difficult for me to come to terms with: The right to pursue a passion and build wealth seems to be reserved for a select few. Maybe no one has the right to do both. But you’re less likely to have to choose if the generation that came before you was wealthy, and less likely still if that generation was white. Closing the wealth gap sounds like an abstract policy agenda, but it’s really about giving more people the power to choose how to care for themselves and their families. The individuals I spoke with know this responsibility intimately. But black wealth is not separate from American wealth—it is the definition of American wealth. Everyone who shares in this country’s wealth also has the responsibility to lift others up. There is no such thing as an individual success story. * Photo-collage images courtesy of Maura Cheeks, Wendy Jones, Derrick Darby, John Swart / Beth A. Keiser / SJP / AP.

        "text": "  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time ORLANDO, Fla. — The gap between the haves and have-nots in the United States grew last year to its highest level in more than 50 years of tracking income inequality, according to Census Bureau figures. Income inequality in the United States expanded from 2017 to 2018, with several heartland states among the leaders of the increase, even though several wealthy coastal states still had the most inequality overall, according to figures released Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau. The nation's Gini Index, which measures income inequality, has been rising steadily over the past five decades. The Gini Index grew from 0.482 in 2017 to 0.485 last year, according to the bureau's 1-year American Community Survey data. The Gini Index is on a scale of 0 to 1; a score of \"0'' indicates perfect equality, while a score of \"1'' indicates perfect inequality, where one household has all the income. The increase in income inequality comes as two Democratic presidential candidates, U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, are pitching a \"wealth tax\" on the nation's richest citizens as a way to reduce wealth disparities. The inequality expansion last year took place at the same time median household income nationwide increased to almost $62,000 last year, the highest ever measured by the American Community Survey. But the 0.8% income increase from 2017 to 2018 was much smaller compared to increases in the previous three years, according to the bureau. Even though household income increased, it was distributed unevenly, with the wealthiest helped out possibly by a tax cut passed by Congress in 2017, said Hector Sandoval, an economist at the University of Florida. \"In 2018 the unemployment rate was already low, and the labor market was getting tight, resulting in higher wages. This can explain the increase in the median household income,\" Sandoval said. \"However, the increase in the Gini index shows that the distribution became more unequal. That is, top income earners got even larger increases in their income, and one of the reasons for that might well be the tax cut.\" A big factor in the increase in inequality has to do with two large population groups on either end of the economic spectrum, according to Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida. On one side, at the peak of their earnings, are baby boomers who are nearing retirement, if they haven't already retired. On the other side are millennials and Gen Z-ers, who are in the early stages of their work life and have lower salaries, Snaith said. \"I would say probably the biggest factor is demographics,\" he said. \"A wealth tax isn't going to fix demographics.\" The area's with the most income inequality last year were coastal places with large amounts of wealth — the District of Columbia, New York and Connecticut, as well as areas with great poverty — Puerto Rico and Louisiana. Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota had the most economic equality. Three of the states with biggest gains in inequality from 2017 to 2018 were places with large pockets of wealth — California, Texas and Virginia. But the other six states were primarily in the heartland — Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire and New Mexico. A variety of factors were at play, from a slowdown in agricultural trade and manufacturing to wages that haven't caught up with other forms of income, economists say. While some states have raised the minimum wage, other states like Kansas haven't. At the same time, the sustained economic growth from the recession a decade ago has enriched people who own stocks, property and other assets, and have sources of income other than wages, said Donna Ginther, an economist at the University of Kansas. \"We've had a period of sustained economic growth, and there are winners and losers. The winners tend to be at the top,\" Ginther said. \"Even though we are at full employment, wages really haven't gone up much in the recovery.\" © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

        "text": "November 1, 2018 12 min read How Economic Inequality Inflicts Real Biological Harm The growing gulf between rich and poor inflicts biological damage on bodies and brains By Robert M. Sapolsky  Andrea Ucini Western cultures have long cherished the notion that all people are created equal. But in the real world, our lives are not balanced with equal opportunities and resources. This distinction was noted mordantly in 1894 by author Anatole France, who wrote that “the law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.” The rich, of course, need none of these things, whereas the poor often have little choice. And economic disparity has only gotten worse during the past several decades, particularly in the U.S. In 1976 the richest 1 percent of U.S. citizens owned 9 percent of the country’s wealth; today they own about 30 percent. This trend echoes around the globe. One of the consequences for the growing poor is worsening health, and the reasons are not as obvious as you might think. Yes, lower socioeconomic status (SES) means less access to health care and living in more disease-prone neighborhoods. And, yes, as the SES ladder’s lower rungs have become more populated, the number of people with medical problems has climbed. This is not merely an issue of poor health for the poor and some version of better health for everyone else. Starting with Elon Musk at the top, every step down the ladder is associated with worse health. The link between socioeconomic inequality and poor health goes beyond simple access to care and living with more dangers. Fewer than half of the health changes along this SES/health ladder can be explained away by risks such as smoking, alcohol consumption and reliance on fast food or by protective factors such as insurance and health club memberships. In the U.K., large, long-term studies of risks in specific groups, led by epidemiologist Michael Marmot and called the Whitehall studies, demonstrated this clearly. Further, this ladder, or gradient, exists in nations with universal health care; if care availability were truly responsible, universal access should make the gradient vanish. Something else, something quite powerful, must be associated with inequities and be able to cause health problems.

That factor seems to be the stressful psychosocial consequences of low SES. Psychologist Nancy Adler of the University of California, San Francisco, and her colleagues have demonstrated that how people rate how they are doing, relative to others, is at least as predictive of health or illness as are any objective measures such as actual income level. The research indicates that poor health is as much about feeling poor as being poor. Epidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett of the University of Nottingham and the University of York in England, respectively, have filled out this picture in detail, showing that while poverty is bad for your health, poverty amid plenty—inequality—can be worse by just about any measure: infant mortality, overall life expectancy, obesity, murder rates, and more. Health is particularly corroded by your nose constantly being rubbed in what you do not have. Basically, more unequal societies have worse quality of life. Across countries and among U.S. states, more inequality, independent of absolute levels of income, predicts higher rates of crime, including homicide, and higher incarceration rates. Add in higher rates of kids being bullied at schools, more teen pregnancies and lower literacy. There are more psychiatric problems, alcoholism and drug use, as well as lower levels of happiness and less social mobility. And there is less social support—a steep hierarchy is the antithesis of the equality and symmetry that nourish friendship. This grim collective picture helps to explain the immensely important fact that when inequality increases, everyone’s health suffers. This is where the problem affects the rich, the haves, as well as the have-nots. With increasing inequality, they typically expend more resources insulating themselves from the world underneath the bridges. I have heard economist Robert Evans of the University of British Columbia call this the “secession of the wealthy.” They spend more of their own resources on gated communities, private schools, bottled water and expensive organic food. And they give lots of money to politicians who help them maintain their status. It is stressful to construct thick walls to keep everything stressful out. Knowing that these psychological and social factors influence the biology of disease is one thing. Demonstrating just how these stressors do their dirty work inside the body is something else. How do SES and inequality “get under the skin”? It turns out that researchers have made significant strides toward an answer. We have learned a lot about how poverty affects biology, and the part of the growing inequality gap that worries people is the poverty end. Scientists have been able to trace physiological connections from external inequality to three key inner areas: chronic inflammation, chromosomal aging and brain function. Thinking about the biology of disease was revolutionized in the 1990s, when the late Bruce McEwen of the Rockefeller University introduced the concept of allostatic load. Our bodies are constantly challenged by our environment, and we stay healthy when we meet those challenges and return to a baseline state, or homeostasis. Traditionally this view led scientists to focus on specific organs that solve specific challenges. Allostasis has a different perspective: physiological challenges provoke far-flung adaptations throughout the body. An infected toe, for instance, will produce not only inflammation at the tip of the foot but also wider changes in everything from energy taken from abdominal fat to the brain chemistry of sleepiness. As this biological grind continues, it leads to an array of body parts functioning less than optimally, which can be as damaging to health as a single organ gone very wrong. Teresa Seeman of the University of California, Los Angeles, took this idea and followed it through the body, measuring various biomarkers of wear and tear, including increases in blood pressure, cholesterol, blood lipids, body mass index, molecular indicators of chronic hyperglycemia, and levels of stress hormones. She showed that this group of disparate measures powerfully predicts physical health and mortality. Recent research by Seeman and others links low SES with heavy allostatic load because the body is in a constant and futile battle to return to a normal, nonstressed state. These findings highlight an important theme: whereas an adult’s SES predicts allostatic wear and tear, childhood SES leaves a stronger lifelong mark. Low SES predisposes youngsters’ bodies toward earlier “aging.” The scientists also found protective factors. Although growing up in an impoverished neighborhood worsens the low SES–allostatic load link, lucking out with a mother who has the time and energy to be highly nurturing reduces the ill effects. Credit: Bryan Christie Design Stress in any form can produce these effects. It does not have to be related to money, but it is usually related to social situations. My own work with baboons living freely on the East African savanna has shown this effect. In baboon groups, an animal’s place in the social hierarchy produces more or less stress. If you are a low-ranking baboon—a socially stressful situation—your body has unhealthy abnormalities in its secretion of glucocorticoids, which are stress hormones such as cortisol. The body also shows unhealthy changes in the gonadal, cardiovascular and immune systems. In animal and human hierarchies, these stress-induced changes affect health through a key process: chronic inflammation. Few things are better examples of a double-edged biological sword than inflammation. After tissue injury, inflammation contains damage and initiates cell repair. Chronic widespread inflammation, however, causes molecular damage throughout the body, and studies have demonstrated that it contributes to diseases ranging from atherosclerosis to Alzheimer’s. Recent work (including my own focusing on inflammation of the nervous system) indicates that chronic high stress levels can promote chronic inflammation. In people, childhood poverty upregulates the adult body’s proinflammatory set point, with increased expression of inflammatory genes and increased levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, which is associated with a higher risk of heart attacks. These are long-term effects: more financial losses in the Great Recession predict higher C-reactive protein levels six years later. Humans share such vulnerabilities with other primates that live in unequal circumstances. Work by Jenny Tung of Duke University shows more markers of chronic inflammation in low-ranking rhesus monkeys compared with the socially dominant animals in a group. Such studies highlight the directness of the link between social stress factors and unhealthy biology because that link occurs in a species that lacks changes in lifestyle risk factors, such as increased rates of smoking and drinking, that we often see in humans who are stuck in low-status situations. Progress in understanding the routes into the body taken by the SES/health gradient has also come through a very sensitive measure of aging: the condition of telomeres, which are the stretches of DNA at the very tips of chromosomes. Telomeres help to keep our chromosomes stable—molecular biologists like to say that they resemble the plastic caps at the ends of shoelaces that prevent fraying. Every time chromosomes are duplicated for cell division, the telomeres shorten; when they get too short, cells can no longer divide, and they lose many of their healthy functions. Telomere shortening is countered by the enzyme telomerase, which rebuilds these tips. Thus, the state of a cell’s telomeres tells much about its biological “age,” and shortened telomeres that produce frayed, vulnerable chromosomes seem to be a molecular version of wear and tear. Telomere biology met stress physiology in a 2004 study led by health psychologist Elissa Epel and molecular biologist Elizabeth Blackburn, then both at U.C.S.F.; Blackburn won a Nobel Prize in 2009 for her pioneering work on telomeres. They examined 39 people who lived with severe stress every day: women who were caregivers for chronically ill children. The landmark finding was that white blood cells in these caregivers had shortened telomeres, decreased telomerase activity, and elevated oxidative damage to proteins and enzymes. (Oxidation can disable telomerase.) The longer a child’s illness, the more stress the women reported and the shorter their telomeres were, even after the researchers accounted for potentially confounding factors such as diet and smoking. Telomeres normally shorten at a more or less constant rate in people, and calculations showed that these women’s telomeres had aged roughly an additional decade—and sometimes more—past those in the low-stress group. This discovery triggered a flood of supporting studies showing that stressors that include major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and the experience of racial discrimination can all accelerate telomere shortening. Unsurprisingly, lower childhood SES also predicts shorter telomeres in adulthood; perceived poor neighborhood quality, witnessing or experiencing violence, family instability (such as divorce, death or incarceration of a parent), and other features of poor status early on are tied to these shrunken chromosome tips later in life. Spend your childhood in poverty, and by middle age your telomeres will probably be about a decade older than those of people with more fortunate childhoods. Thus, from the macro level of entire body systems to the micro level of individual chromosomes, poverty finds a way to produce wear and tear. Most studies of telomere length compare “poor” with “non-poor,” as do the studies comparing allostatic load, but the few studies that examine the whole spectrum of inequality, step by low-status step, show that every rung down the SES ladder most likely worsens these biological markers of aging. Slipping down these rungs also changes the brain and behavior, according to a slew of recent neurobiological studies. My laboratory has devoted more than a quarter of a century to studying what ongoing stress does to the brain in rodents, monkeys and humans. Along with other labs, we have learned that one hotspot is the hippocampus, a region critical to learning and memory. Sustained stress or exposure to excessive glucocorticoids impairs memory by lowering hippocampal excitability, retracting connections between neurons and suppressing the birth of new neurons. In the amygdala, a brain area that is central to fear and anxiety, stress and glucocorticoids heighten those two reactions. Instead of damping things down as they do in the hippocampus, in this fear-promoting region they increase excitability and expand neuronal connections. Together these findings help to explain why post-traumatic stress disorder atrophies the hippocampus and enlarges the amygdala. Another affected area is the mesolimbic dopamine system, which is crucial to reward, anticipation and motivation. Chronic stress disrupts that system, and the result is a predisposition toward the anhedonia of depression and vulnerability to addiction. Bombardment by glucocorticoids also affects the prefrontal cortex (PFC), key to long-term planning, executive function and impulse control. In the PFC, social stress and elevated glucocorticoids weaken connections between neurons, making it harder for them to communicate. Myelination, the process that insulates cables between neurons and thus helps them pass signals faster, is impaired. Total cell volume in the region declines, and chronic inflammation is activated.

Bloomsbury, 2009; Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce (U.S. income per capita data); Human Development Report 2007/2008: Fighting Climate Change: Human Solidarity in a Divided World. United Nations Development Program, 2007 (GDP per capita data) What happens when the PFC is impaired in this way? Lousy, impulsive decisions happen. Consider “temporal discounting”: when choosing between an immediate reward and a bigger one if you wait, the appeal of waiting goes down as the time you have to wait goes up. The PFC is normally good at combating this shortsightedness. But stress steepens temporal discounting; the more cumulative stress, the less PFC activation in experiments that call for gratification postponement. For people sliding further into inequality, the less active PFC makes it harder for the brain to choose long-term health over immediate pleasure. That neurological effect might explain why people with more total life stress gain more weight and smoke and drink more than those with fewer stressors. These changes in the PFC happen in children, too. In separate studies, Martha Farah of the University of Pennsylvania and W. Thomas Boyce, professor emeritus at U.C.S.F., observed that lower-SES kindergartners typically have elevated glucocorticoid levels, a thinner and less active PFC, and poor PFC-dependent impulse control and executive function. These effects increase as kids get older. By adolescence, lower SES predicts smaller PFC volume. By adulthood, low SES predicts steeper temporally discounted decisions. Some of these observations present a tricky chicken-and-egg question. The brain changes could lead to poor choices, which in turn lead to deeper poverty, rather than the other way around. But the research suggests that causes and effects run in the other direction, with SES and inequality first influencing PFC function and then other bad things happening. For example, kindergartners’ SES predicted their PFC function; few five-year-olds plummet into poverty by squandering their paychecks on drink and horses. Further evidence comes from a 2013 study by Jiaying Zhao of the University of British Columbia and her colleagues. They examined Indian farmers whose economic fortunes vary seasonably. As individuals’ SES went from being poorest during planting season to wealthiest after harvest, improvements in PFC function followed. To me, the most important evidence comes from research in which people’s sense of their SES was lowered by the design of the experiment. Afterward these individuals did heavier temporal discounting. In one 2012 study, subjects played a game of chance against one another, with differing amounts of starting resources. “Poor” subjects became more likely to borrow against future earnings and less attuned to helpful clues about game strategy. In another study, subjects who were prompted to imagine scenarios of financial loss (versus neutral or advantageous ones) did steeper temporal discounting in an unrelated task. In still other research, subjects were primed to imagine their financial burdens by contemplating an expensive car repair; cognitive function was unchanged in high-SES subjects but declined in poorer individuals. Why should a transient sense of lower SES induce cognitive changes typical of lower SES in the real world? One explanation is that it is a rational response because it is hard to think about squirreling away money for old age if you can barely buy groceries. Poverty makes the future a less relevant place. But there is also a powerful stress-related explanation: long-term planning and impulse control tires out the PFC. Increase subjects’ cognitive “load” with taxing PFC-dependent tasks, and they become more likely to cheat on their diet. Or you can—and scientists have done this—increase cognitive load by tempting dieting subjects with snacks, and then they do worse on PFC-dependent tests. How much this represents literal “depletion” of the PFC metabolically versus declining motivation is unclear. Either way, lower SES creates chronic financial worry that distracts and exhausts. It is hard to ace a psychological task of, say, subtracting a series of numbers or a more important task of reining in your drinking when you are worrying about paying your rent. One finding in the car-repair study supports this interpretation. When subjects contemplated a repair of negligible cost, low- and high-SES subjects performed equally well on cognitive tasks. Of course, we need to better understand the biological consequences of inequality and learn better ways to heal its health scars. But frankly, right now we know quite a bit. We know enough to prompt moral outrage at the situation. It is outrageous that if children are born into a disadvantaged family, they will be predisposed toward poor health by the time they start to learn the alphabet. It should not require us to measure inflammation or the length of chromosomes to prove this is wrong, but if it does, more power to this science. Robert M. Sapolsky is a professor of biological sciences, neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford University and a research associate at the National Museums of Kenya. In his laboratory work, he focuses on how stress can damage the brain and on gene therapy for the nervous system. He also studies populations of wild baboons in East Africa, trying to determine the relation between the social rank of a baboon and its health.

        "title": "Meet the millionaires living 'underconsumption': They shop at Aldi and Goodwill and own secondhand cars",
        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "How do the rich stay rich? Apparently, by acting like they’re not. In a world of fast fashion, TikTok trends and next-day delivery, it might be easy to splash a six-figure salary on all the latest consumables. But the high net worth individuals and $100,000+ earners Fortune spoke to said the opposite: They try and keep their discretionary spending as minimal as possible, preferring the impact it has on their finances. While their friends might enjoy eating out a couple of times a week, they choose to cook for themselves—in fact, they even buy frozen groceries because they’re cheaper than fresh. Some choose not to own cars, mend their own ‘capsule’ wardrobes and find some of their children’s toys on Facebook marketplace. These individuals—in some cases unconsciously—are living an ‘under-consumption’ or ‘low consumption’ lifestyle. The phrase began to spread on social media sites like TikTok after individuals started sharing their weekly grocery shop or make-up cabinet to counter the infinite shopping hauls or wishlists often found on the app. The advice from the ‘underconsumption core’ community included setting no-buy challenges or decluttering spaces packed with items you’re not using.  For the individuals Fortune spoke to, these habits are already second nature. And having lived the underconsumption life for most of their adult years, their bank balance is reaping the rewards. Author and entrepreneur Shang Saavedra and her husband didn’t build a multi-million dollar net worth overnight. In fact, it was in their respective childhoods that they learned the value of frugal living. Renting a four-bed home in the suburbs of Los Angeles, the pair share a 16-year-old secondhand vehicle and do their grocery shop at Aldi—predominantly in the frozen section.  Saavedra’s sons—aged five and two—often wear hand-me-down clothes, play with toys found on Facebook marketplace and enjoy free activities instead of the Disneyland trips their Californian peers often take.  While multi-millionaire Saavedra’s life has some hallmarks of a high-income household—her children attend private school, and she owns property in New York—these expenditures fit with her financial ethos: investing in education and assets that support her philanthropic endeavors. Contrary to the majority of Americans—58% of which told a Harris Poll survey last year they worry about their finances during the festive period—Saavedra says her day-to-day expenses during Thanksgiving and Christmas predominantly increase because of philanthropic gifting.  The 39-year-old’s ability to share her wealth is courtesy of shrewd money decisions in her early career—when she held a director position at CVS, and analyst and consultancy roles at the likes of Victoria’s Secret. Before marriage, Saavedra lived with roommates and then moved into a rent-controlled apartment with her husband in New York (a building where the plumbing often cut out), often using meal vouchers handed out by working late in their corporate roles. They aimed to reduce their expenditures to a single income and save the rest, in preparation for having children. Saavedra, now an entrepreneur helping hundreds of clients achieve their financial goals, told Fortune in an interview that the best way for people to try an underconsumption lifestyle is to “start with why.” “What is the end goal of underconsumption? If you just do underconsumption for underconsumption’s sake you’ll burn out and get unhappy very quickly,” Saavedra explained. “Because my husband and I oriented our consumption towards financial freedom and family it’s made it so worth it.  “Of course I still am tempted to go for luxury items and experiences, and every now and then we have a nice date night at a very nice restaurant—but understanding the reason why you want something … comes from a pain for an unfulfilled part of your life and oftentimes is a psychological need.” What it takes to run a household is only getting more expensive. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average monthly household expenditure in 2023 was $6,440. This is a steep increase compared to only a year prior—up 8.3%—and up 15.5% from 2021, when monthly expenditures sat at $5,577 a month. Yet despite the fact Annie Cole owns assets totaling more than a million dollars—and is earning six figures—she has trimmed her spending down to a little under $4,000 a month. Cole sold her Prius a couple of years ago, batch cooks meals for her and her husband, cuts her own hair and clothes shops three times a year at her local Goodwill—Cole last purchased new clothes a year ago, and with a gift card. The couple travel using air miles and points accrued when Cole, 36, was traveling for a corporate role, spending their vacations enjoying free activities like hiking and swimming.  The approach has not only changed Cole’s outlook on how long she will work—retirement is pencilled in for her early 40s—but the nature of work itself.  “I’m so curious if I will actually want to retire,” Cole—who works as a contracted researcher and personal finance expert—tells Fortune. “Now that I’m working part-time I think about it differently. When I was working full-time I thought ‘I can’t wait to be work-optional’  but I almost feel like I’m living it now.  “I’m doing all the things I want to do and knowing that I could retire feels like a nice financial cushion of ‘Hey, you’re taken care of as you get older and in the meantime you have the flexibility to live and work differently.’ That’s a blessing in itself.”  Dentist Robert Chin and his partner Jessica Pharar own a practice in Las Vegas. They commute the short drive from their home together to cut down on fuel, with their packed lunches in tow. The couple transitioned into a lower-consumption lifestyle courtesy of rising costs and a firmer idea of what they wanted their finances to look like—despite the pair earning comfortable six figures. Chin tells Fortune he now eats out one or two times a month instead of a few times a week, and shops at Costco to avoid inflationary grocery prices as best he can. Unlike the other sources Fortune spoke to, Chin isn’t against buying new clothes but maintains that they must have a lifetime guarantee (from the likes of Patagonia) or that they will last for years. The pair own a condo which they let out, but rent their current property to have the flexibility to purchase when the market begins to move again.  Their goal is simple: Flexibility—whether that means taking more time off together or potentially retiring earlier.  “In five years we’d like to have an associate or another practitioner both because the office has grown enough to support that and also because it affords us the flexibility to take time off more readily. It’s proabably the biggest challenge of us being leaders in the business, our ability to take time off is really difficult because if we’re not here the practice doesn’t make money.” Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning senior reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance.

        "title": "The number of super-rich people is exploding—and it’s raising the bar for what’s considered ‘wealthy’",
        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "For the average person, $30 million is a lot of money—but for the ultra-high-net-worth individual (UHNWI), that’s the bare minimum nowadays.  That’s because the number of individuals with more than $30 million in assets—the generally accepted threshold for the “ultra-high-net-worth individuals”— grew from 157,000 in 2016 to 220,000 in 2023, according to data from Capgemini. That’s a jump of nearly 28% in just seven years.  Now, with so many more multimillionaires milling around, outbidding one another on priceless art and decked-out yachts, the actual bar for what’s considered “wealthy” is creeping ever upward, rapidly tacking on extra zeroes.  Many of the new self-made UHNWIs of today “built their wealth primarily through entrepreneurship or executive roles in the technology sector,” Elias Ghanem, the global head of Capgemini’s Research Institute for Financial Services, told Fortune.  How does that increased baseline for what’s considered “wealthy” change behavior, habits or desires among the ultra-rich? UHNWIs are “primarily focused on wealth growth,” Ghanem said. “In contrast, the primary objective for the rest of the HNWI segment remains around wealth preservation.”  The difference is because UHNWIs know they can weather short-term market fluctuations—thanks to their “long-term investment horizons and substantial discretionary wealth.” As a result, Ghanem said, their risk tolerance skews higher. Inflation, without a doubt, has made multi-millionaire status both more ubiquitous and further out of reach. So has the explosion of avenues—crypto, startups, tech, entrepreneurship, even influencing—via which businesspeople can amass a fortune. Capgemini’s data shows the number of UHNWIs in North America grew by 7.3% last year, owing to “economic resilience, cooling inflationary pressures, and a US equity market rally,” Ghanem said. “A slew” of U.S. government-led spending initiatives aimed at boosting onshore manufacturing have also led to capital growth, Ghanem added. He name-checked the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act—both announced in 2022—as two major contributors.  The CHIPS Act led to over $230 billion in private-sector spending for the semiconductor manufacturing industry; the Inflation Reduction Act led to $201 billion in construction spending.  At the same time, the U.S.’s GDP—which grew last year at a much larger rate than expected, 3.3% annualized—is another major factor. Each of these forces led to “the biggest economic revolution in generations” and a watershed of new UHNWIs whose companies—or investments—were part of the boom. $30 million, for most working people, would no doubt make for an easy, luxurious lifestyle—but among the cream of the crop, that figure is “just the starting point,” David Gibson-Moore, the president of consultancy Gulf Analytica, told the Financial Times. “The ultra-rich today are being measured by new standards, with some financial commentators now suggesting $100 million is the new yardstick for anyone who wants to keep their head held high at private equity parties.”  According to Knight Frank’s 2024 Wealth Report, “the robust performance of the US economy and a sharp uptick in equity markets” spurred global wealth creation, which led to—by the end of 2023—4.2% more UHNWIs than a year earlier, for a total of just over 626,600 around the world.  North America, naturally, led the growth, but Europe nonetheless is home to the wealthiest one-percenters, Knight Frank found. Rich people have never been such a large group—but breaking in has never been more of an uphill battle, with some experts saying it now takes $50 or $100 million in assets to join the club. The number of wealthy individuals globally are set to rise by another 28% or so over the next four years, Knight Frank predicted in its report, but the rate of expansion will be “noticeably slower” than in the five-year period between 2018 and 2023, mainly owing to the impacts of inflation. “This expanding cohort of wealthy individuals looks favorably on real estate,” Knight Frank went on. “Almost a fifth of UHNWIs plan to invest in commercial real estate this year, while more than a fifth are planning to buy residential. Growth over the forecast period provides various opportunities for investors, particularly developers able to deliver property that suits the shifting tastes of the newly minted.” Almost all (91%) of UHNWIs gravitate towards passion investments, Capgemini research has found, like luxury real estate, wine, collectibles, and art. “The growing appetite for luxury second homes has pushed real-estate advice into the top five of UHNWIs’ service requirements when deciding to select a wealth management firm,” Ghanem added. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "In the morning Mitzi Perdue gets up, makes herself a cup of tea and cracks on with her work as a writer. If she heads out to see any of her four grandchildren who also live in Maryland, she might wave to her neighbors—variously librarians and doctors—who also live in the building where she rents an apartment. Perdue may even walk past a chicken factory bearing her name because she is in fact an heiress worth billions—both through the Perdue chicken empire and the Sheraton hotel group.   Over in Chicago, Elena Nuñez Cooper catches an Uber to work—she doesn’t own a car—and spends six days a week working from the shared office space in her member’s club, instead of renting costly commercial space.  Down in Florida, tech entrepreneur Brenda Christensen spends her weekends exercising and enjoying the outdoors—avoiding coffee chains, the cinema and meals out as much as possible.  Though not as rich as Purdue, both Nuñez Cooper and Christensen have fortunes that run into the multi-millions—but choose to rein in their finances and live a low-key life.  Theirs is a method that legendary investor Warren Buffett has long adopted: living in the same home he purchased in Omaha for $31,500 in 1958 and notoriously driving a 20-year-old car because he felt safe in it.  “I do not think that standard of living equates with cost of living beyond a certain point,” the man reportedly worth $116 billion famously said at a Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting. “There’s a point, if anything, you start getting inverse correlation. “My life would not be happier…it’d be worse if I had six or eight houses or a whole bunch of different things I could have. It just doesn’t correlate.” The data certainly backs up Buffett’s philosophy. In March 2023 the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania sought to answer the question of whether money can truly buy happiness. Working with two datasets from previous studies, the researchers found that larger incomes do correlate with increasing happiness. However, only to a point: $100,000 to be exact.  So what happens when you go above that threshold, and realize the full extent of what you can do with your wealth? For 82-year-old Perdue, a self-professed “low maintenance badass,” her wealth is an institution of which she is a steward as opposed to a keeper. Her parents taught Perdue early on that a person’s identity was formed through their service, not their spending—a philosophy also followed by the family of her late husband, Frank Purdue. “We were married for 17 years until his passing,” Perdue told Fortune in a video interview. “During that time, I believe that I had the highest cobbler bill in Maryland, because rather than buy new shoes, we would simply get them repaired.  “He had his name on the paycheck of 20,000 people but we would always fly economy.” Perdue grew up with a different idea of success, with a childhood where frugality and economy were celebrated.  “I have a phrase that guides me,” Perdue said. “And it’s that success is not measured by what you can get, but what you can give.” Like many billionaire families, the Perdues are keen but quiet philanthropists—among her aid to Ukraine has been the purchase of police vehicles and the donation of a $1.2 million ring, the proceeds of which enabled a women’s shelter to open.  Yet Perdue doesn’t just want to send funds—she rolls up her sleeves and gets involved. Perdue has visited Ukraine three times—traveling the country through air raids, interviewing sources in bomb shelters, and meeting police bosses in war-torn Kyiv.  Focussing particularly on the issues of human trafficking and land mines, Perdue says she’s “stared evil in the face,” describing her work in Ukraine as “possibly the best thing I’ve ever done in my life.”  One of many initiatives was to purchase boats for the Ukrainian police, which were named after people who had lost their lives in the conflict. Perdue met with their families, she said, adding: “I think to be remembered and recognized was enormously important. And that I could help a little bit—and I emphasize the word little—in keeping that person’s memory alive and their sacrifice remembered.  “What better use could you really have? I know it’s not a lot. Even a little is just a tip of grief for somebody who’s lost a child.” Mom-of-one Christensen propelled herself to the status of self-made millionaire 10 times over, after moving from journalism to communications in the tech sector.  Having sold her equity in one of the early firms she worked for, GoldMine Software—and enjoying a two-week retirement before boredom set in—Christensen took to flipping property in California. In 2015, Christensen, now the CEO of a public relations firm, moved her family out of Malibu to Florida—cutting her living expenses by 20% overnight—much to the shock of her peers at the time.  What they didn’t understand was the principle Christensen was raised with: her Danish father, a proponent of living simply and well, taught his children to recognize their privilege.  “My father grew up in Puerto Rico,” Christensen told Fortune. “He made us very aware at an early age how privileged we were. He took us through the slums of Puerto Rico and said: ‘I want you to know that not everybody lives in a suburban area in the United States. This is how most of the world lives.’  “He was just instilling in me that it’s not about stuff, it’s about helping others and being of service.” Already teaching her 16-year-old daughter the same values she was raised with, Christensen added: “I don’t go to restaurants. I don’t go to movies. I don’t go to concerts. I cut my own hair.  “I was pre-med at university so rarely go to the doctor because I understand how to take care of myself very well—diet, exercise all of that. I don’t go to Starbucks, I avoid it like the plague. It just feels comfortable too because I’ve always been frugal.” For Nuñez Cooper, cutting back on her expenditure has meant she can donate sizable aid contributions to international crises whenever she wishes.  The 32-year-old founder of Chicago-based Ascend PR, a firm that also acts as an advisor to family offices, said in her younger years she had enjoyed a “lavish” lifestyle. But Nuñez Cooper and her husband—who share a wealth of more than $4 million—knew if they lived not just within, but well under, their means they could “give more and do more for people.” Among the costs cut was private jet use, which was axed for environmental reasons as well, while also bringing down a summer travel budget of six figures to a third of its former cost—predominantly by staying in rooms on offer at her members’ club instead of paying for five-star hotels. “I don’t know that I was any happier,” Nuñez Cooper said in an interview with Fortune, adding when she made the decision to no longer have a car many peers asked if she was broke.  “I like living a more simply but still living well. My quality of life has not decreased at all.” Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning senior reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance.

        "title": "Why is fast food so expensive: Inflation mindset hurts McDonald's, other chains",
        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "Move over, Hermès and Miu Miu—the newest luxury purse flying under the radar is a crinkled paper bag filled with burgers and greasy fries. The vast majority of Americans now find fast food way too expensive, dubbing it a “luxury,” a new report found. Of 2,000 American adults, 78% considered fast food a luxury because of its price tag, loan marketplace LendingTree found in a survey released Monday, using data from QuestionPro commissioned by ValuePenguin. Half of respondents said their own stretched financial situation made fast food feel like a luxury, and more than six in 10 said they had cut down on fast food because of rising prices. “Fast food often isn’t this quick, cheap option anymore,” LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz told Fortune over email. “People are having sticker shock at the drive-thru, causing them to rethink how often they eat fast food.” Respondents participated in the survey in early April—the same time California’s $20 minimum wage law for fast-food workers went into effect, causing chains like Chipotle to threaten 6%–7% increases in menu price. Even before the minimum wage law was enacted, consumers revolted against McDonald’s $18 Big Mac meal and blasted Wendy’s for its introduction of “dynamic pricing” in February, using AI to change menu item costs depending on the level of traffic during certain times of day. The burger chain backtracked the day after the announcement, saying it had no plans to raise prices, only provide discounts. Indeed, pinched consumers are most concerned about surge pricing, with 72% of those surveyed saying they would dine during off-hours if it meant cheaper menu items. Over half of respondents said they now cook at home if they’re looking for a quick, cheap meal. Stephen Zagor, food and restaurant consultant and adjunct assistant professor of business at the Columbia Business School, told Fortune that bad attitudes toward fast-food companies are an extension of the mentality so many have about the economy. As fast-food prices continue to rise even as inflation cools, consumer sentiment is dipping: In May, it reached its lowest point in six months. “We’re in this inflationary mental cycle as much as we are an inflationary reality cycle,” Zagor said. But there’s good news on the horizon for customers feeling dejected by the state of fast-food prices, Zagor said. Burger chains are feeling pressure to make changes. “They hear the customers’ pain, and they’re trying to be responsive—as they well should be,” he said. McDonald’s announced last week its plans to launch a $5 meal deal of a burger or chicken sandwich, fries, a four-piece nugget, and a drink. Wendy’s responded similarly, rolling out a $3 breakfast deal with breakfast potatoes and a choice of bacon or sausage, egg, and cheese English muffin. The changes came after fast-food chains noticed sales dips driven by choosy customers. “The consumer is certainly being very discriminating in how they spend their dollar,” McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said during a call with investors this month. “It may be more pronounced with lower-income consumers, but it’s important to recognize that all income cohorts are seeking value.” While McDonald’s is only promising its $5 meal deal for a month—with franchisees asking the company to invest in the operation—additional promotions are likely to stick around, though likely in different forms, such as app-exclusive deals or cheap menu add-ons for digital orders, Zagor said. Fast-food companies are under pressure to keep their customers happy, even if it is initially a bigger lift for investors and the bottom line, he argued. A “relationship-based” business, the restaurant industry still has to promise its diners a return on the dining experience, even if it’s just a quick drive-thru transaction. With over 70 million customers daily, chains like McDonald’s are a cornerstone of people’s lives, Zagor said, and they are under obligation to stay that way. “The truth of the matter is, we love McDonald’s. It’s an American brand. It’s who we are—good or bad, hate it or love it, think it’s healthy or unhealthy. It’s who we are.” Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "Luxury homes are, well, luxurious—but they happen to be more expensive than ever, too. The typical luxury home sold for a record $1,225,000 in the first quarter of this year, 8.7% higher than the year before, according to Redfin.  Spending more than a million dollars on a home might not seem like much for those in California, but it is. It turns out luxury home prices are rising much faster than those of non-luxury homes, which are at a record high, too, but only rose 4.6% in the first quarter to $345,000. (The analysis considers luxury homes as those in the top 5% of their respective metropolitan area in terms of value.) The three most expensive home sales across the country occurred in Miami, Seattle, and Los Angeles, for $48 million, $38.9 million, and $38.5 million, respectively, in the first quarter.  Apparently demand for opulent homes is still very prevalent, but part of that is because those who can afford luxury homes are undeterred by high mortgage rates—either because they pay in cash, or can afford it either way. The number of luxury homes bought in all-cash is at an all-time high, according to Redfin: Nearly half of luxury homes purchased during the three months ended Feb. 29 were purchased in cash (the highest in at least a decade). Even so, demand for such homes has “held up better than demand for middle-of-the-road homes,” Redfin’s data journalist Dana Anderson wrote in an analysis published Friday. And more demand has translated to more sales. Sales of lavish homes rose 2.1% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. But sales of non-luxury, or typical, homes fell 4.2% over the same period.  “People with the means to buy high-end homes are jumping in now because they feel confident prices will continue to rise,” David Palmer, a Seattle-based Redfin agent, said in the analysis. “They’re ready to buy with more optimism and less apprehension.” Palmer added, “It’s a similar sentiment on the selling side: Prices continue to increase for high-end homes, so homeowners feel it’s a good time to cash in on their equity. Even though mortgage rates remain elevated and demand isn’t as high as it was during the pandemic, many homebuyers and sellers feel the worst of the housing downturn is behind us.” Interestingly enough, luxury-home sales only began rising in January for the first time since August 2021, but non-luxury home sales haven’t risen since the end of that same year. All existing home sales fell last year to their lowest point in 28 years. And after what felt like the beginning of a recovery, existing home sales fell again in March on a monthly and annual basis—but home prices rose.  So what’s happening in the luxury market isn’t too far off from the broader housing world, even if it is doing better than the so-called normal home market. But it might be doing better than you’d expect.  In March last year, Redfin published an analysis that found luxury-home sales declined almost 45% in the three months ended Jan. 31. It was greater than the drop in sales for non-luxury homes, which had fallen more than 37% in the same period. At the time, Redfin listed several reasons for its fall: People were tending to purchase fewer expensive things during a period of economic uncertainty; luxury-home sales rose faster during the pandemic housing boom so they had more room to fall; and the wealthy were losing money in the stock market and were generally worried about real estate.  Maybe the latest news signals a change in the mindset of the wealthy. Or it could be as simple as there being more luxury homes on the market. “The total number of luxury homes for sale rose 12.6% from a year earlier in the first quarter, the biggest increase on record,” Anderson wrote, adding: “New listings of luxury homes soared 18.5% from a year earlier in the first quarter, the second consecutive quarter of double-digit increases.” Part of this has to do with the “lock-in effect,” which refers to homeowners refusing to sell for fear of losing their low mortgage rate. It has less of an impact on luxury homeowners, either because they can take on a new, higher mortgage rate or buy their home in cash (as opposed to less-wealthy people). Both figures are substantially greater than those of non-luxury homes, but are still lower than pre-pandemic levels—and that’s part of the reason we’re seeing prices go up.

        "domain": "cbsnews.com",
        "text": "Watch CBS News \nUpdated on:  July 22, 2024 / 9:52 AM EDT\n            / CBS Boston\n           BOSTON -- The Celtics locked up another key member of their championship team on Sunday, reportedly signing sharpshooter Sam Hauser to a four-year, $45 million extension. Boston's championship core is intact for the foreseeable future, but that also means that the team is in for an extremely expensive luxury penalty. With Hauser now locked in for the next five seasons -- he'll make $2 million next season before his extension begins in the 2025-26 season -- seven of Boston's top eight players are signed through the next two seasons. The lone exception is 38-year-old Al Horford, who is only signed through next season. Hauser's extension is the third one given out by Brad Stevens this summer, after he gave Jayson Tatum the richest deal in NBA history (a five-year, $315 million supermax) and signed Derrick White to a four-year, $125 million extension. Stevens and the Celtics also re-signed three big men this summer, handing out a one-year, $2.8 million deal to Luke Kornet, a two-year, $4.7 million contract to Xavier Tillman, and a three-year, $7.1 million pact to Neemias Queta. Not to be forgotten is the four-year, $134 million extension that Jrue Holiday signed in the spring. Add all of that to Jaylen Brown's five-year, $305 million supermax that begins this upcoming season, Kristaps Porzingis starting his two-year, $60 million extension, and Payton Pritchard's four-year, $30 million contract, and the Boston Celtics are now one of the most expensive teams in NBA history. By the time the 2025-26 season rolls around, the Celtics' payroll will be hovering around $230 million. Their luxury tax penalty is projected to be even higher, meaning the Celtics will be paying nearly $500 million for that season.  The Boston Celtics and Phoenix Suns both currently project to have luxury tax penalties higher than their payrolls in 2025-26.If the Celtics want to save money, it would need to be via trade. The Suns could more easily save over $100 million by cutting Josh Okogie and declining… pic.twitter.com/F2f6HKe0dN Let's hope that whoever buys the team has some deep, deep pockets. In being a second apron team for the second straight year, the Celtics also won't be able to trade away their first-round picks in 2032 or 2033.  At least the salary cap and the apron levels should rise in the coming years, so things could improve slightly from a numbers (and tax penalty) standpoint for Boston. And in the short term, the Hauser deal means that the Celtics are pretty much running back the same roster that just won an NBA Championship for the next two seasons, putting the team in a great spot to potentially repeat or add another banner in the coming years.  Brad Stevens has been committed to keeping this championship core together, no matter the future costs. And if the Celtics ownership is OK with paying some massive tax bills, it should keep the team in contention for years to come.  \n      © 2024 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

        "title": "How the Richest People in America Avoid Paying Taxes",
        "domain": "theatlantic.com",
        "text": "A clever new paper puts concrete numbers to the taxes paid by members of the Forbes 400. Listen to more stories on the  Noa app. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the richest of rich Americans pay an average tax rate of 34 percent, higher than any other cohort’s. In reality, as everyone has long known, they pay less than that. A new study by some of the country’s most preeminent economists has finally put concrete numbers to the disparity. The average rate that the richest Americans pay, they find, sits at just 24 percent. That number has fallen markedly in recent years and will remain low for the foreseeable future, thanks to Donald Trump. The new study is a technical feat, combining data on corporate earnings, private wealth, and individual tax payments. And it confirms that the country’s tax code is regressive, not progressive, at the very top. Every year, America’s richest citizens paper over their earnings with losses and use other creative accounting strategies to shelter their fortunes, as the tax code allows them to do. As a result, the country’s billionaires pay lower tax rates than many of its millionaires do. Indeed, they pay lower tax rates than many middle-class professionals. The study, by the UC Berkeley economists Akcan Balkir, Emmanuel Saez, Danny Yagan, and Gabriel Zucman, examines the wealth of Americans on the Forbes 400—not the 1 percent or even 0.01 percent, but the 0.0002 percent, a group including Larry Ellison, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Trump himself. As of this year, these individuals have a minimum net worth of $3.3 billion. Rogé Karma: Buy, borrow, die To study these billionaires and their wealth-management strategies, Saez, Zucman, and their co-authors could not examine their personal tax returns. The IRS’s strict data-privacy rules would prevent any academic from doing so. Instead, they received anonymized IRS data files, provided only to vetted researchers, on the richest 400 Americans by wealth, rather than earnings. The data were pooled so that the researchers couldn’t connect specific numbers to any particular individual. The academics augmented the pooled statistics with information culled from the annual filings made by public companies, government data on gift and estate taxes, and IRS data on the earnings of private firms. Many wealthy Americans do not have much in the way of salaries or realized earnings to tax in a given year. Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, whose net worth was estimated by Forbes last year to be $181 billion, pays himself a $1 base salary at Meta. Last year, he took home $27 million in total compensation—an immense sum, but not much given the company’s profits, and a fraction of what some of the company’s top artificial-intelligence engineers reportedly make. Business titans tend to take their compensation as shares in publicly traded companies and privately held businesses, as well as investments in “pass-through” companies with special tax rules. As a result, their incomes are smaller than one might expect, and subject more to the country’s loopholed corporate-tax code than to its straightforward individual marginal tax rates. And, as a result, research on the tax rates paid by the country’s highest earners, as measured by personal income, does not shed much light on the tax rates paid by the country’s wealthiest people. David A. Graham: Americans are starting to sour on tax cuts In some ways, the new study is more comprehensive than an analysis of the billionaires’ 1040 forms would be, Saez and Zucman told me in an email, because it “includes not only individual income tax, but all the other taxes, and particularly corporate taxes” that they pay. The “biggest surprise,” Saez and Zucman said, was that the country’s billionaires—or, more precisely, their highly compensated accountants—had used deductions and exclusions, such as depreciation, to make their profitable pass-through businesses appear to be operating at a loss. Those paper losses reduced the billionaires’ taxable income by $33 million a year, on average, between 2018 and 2020. The effect was so pronounced that companies’ taxable income was “no longer a good measure” of their “true profits,” the economists told me. In the end, the top 400 Americans paid an estimated 23.8 percent of their income to Uncle Sam from 2018 to 2020—down from roughly 30 percent before the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in 2017. They paid 1.3 percent of their total wealth to the IRS in those years, down from 2.7 percent from 2010 to 2013. Their tax rates were lower than the average paid by all American households. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Trump’s signature first-term domestic-policy package, helped these billionaires keep more of their money. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed this summer, extends the TCJA’s tax cuts, creates new business loopholes, and lowers taxes on estates. To help offset the revenue losses, the Trump administration is stripping health coverage from millions of low-income Americans and shrinking the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The rich, including Trump, will keep getting richer. The poor will pay for it. Support for this project was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "Money is power, and the world’s elite are grabbing enough to outpace the wealth of most countries. They would be even richer if it weren’t for tanking stocks and a troubled S&P 500. Forbes’ 2025 World’s Billionaires List featured over 3,028 members—the biggest cohort of the global elite the ranking has ever recorded, marking the first time the list has surpassed 3,000 people.  The combined wealth of these entrepreneurs, investors, and heirs sits at $16.1 trillion, up $2 trillion from 2024. The U.S. was home to a record of 902 billionaires, while China and Hong Kong trailed behind at housing 516, and India being the homebase to 205.  Their eye-watering wealth pool of $16.1 trillion is difficult for most to even conceptualize. So to put that into perspective, their collective wealth surpasses the GDP of every single country in the world aside from the U.S. and China.  There were also three people—Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos—who made it to the $200 billion club this year. Their net worths alone counter the wealth of nations; Elon Musk’s $342 billion challenges that of Finland; Mark Zuckerberg’s $216 billion is higher than the GDP of Algeria; and Jeff Bezos’ $215 billion outpaces Hungary.  Billionaires’ $2 trillion wealth surge during 2024 paints a picture of where the global elite is heading. Oxfam found that 204 new billionaires were minted last year—nearly four every week—and looking ahead, predicts there will be at least five trillionaires within a decade.  The data also shows that about 60% of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power, or nepotism connections, showing most money was passed down rather than earned through entrepreneurship. While these elite continue to wield more and more of the world’s wealth, money gets sucked from lower classes. Most Americans report living paycheck-to-paycheck, and the number of people living in poverty has barely budged since the 1990s.  “The capture of our global economy by a privileged few has reached heights once considered unimaginable,” Amitabh Behar, international executive director at Oxfam, said in the press release. “Not only has the rate of billionaire wealth accumulation accelerated—by three times—but so too has their power.” The world’s richest people would have even more money to burn if it weren’t for tanking stocks—with some billionaires’ companies hit harder, based on how they wield their power. Take the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, and his company Tesla for example. The car business’ shares slumped 4% after it recently reported a 13% decline in sales this year. This shortly follows Tesla’s 36% stock plummet during the first three months of 2025—its worst quarter since 2022—that sent about $156 billion of Musk’s wealth up into flames.  Read more from Fortune   Tesla’s downturn has been connected to Musk’s unpopular involvement in the U.S. government, consumer protests and boycotts ravaging the company’s sales. However, Trump recently suggested that Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could be shuttered before the end of its planned 130-day stint. President Trump’s vehicle tariffs won’t do him any favors, either—especially as China is already full-steam ahead in the EV race. Fortune reached out to Tesla for comment. But it’s not just unpopular entrepreneurs who have fallen out of favor with the stock market right now.  The S&P 500 dropped 7%, Dow Jones dipped 6%, and Nasdaq fell 10% during the first 60 days of Trump’s presidency. And Wall Street’s most dependable bulls are pulling the plug on their original estimates; in the aftermath of the first quarter, strategists at Goldman Sachs, Societe Generale, and Yardeni Research all lowered their end-of-year targets for the benchmark.  Many of the world’s richest have been impacted the most by troubled markets; Jeff Bezos lost $29 billion between late January and March, Sergey Brin is down $22 billion, and Bernald Arnault and Mark Zuckerberg each coughed up $5 billion. The billionaires who attended Trump’s inauguration are estimated to have lost $209 billion altogether.

        "title": "Billionaire Wealth Surged By $2 Trillion Last Year, Report Shows",
        "domain": "forbes.com",
        "text": "ByJosie Cox, Contributor. The combined wealth of the world’s richest individuals surged by $2 trillion last year—three times faster than in 2023—according to a new report published on the eve of the World Economic Forum, an annual meeting of billionaires, hosted in the Swiss Alps.  The report by Oxfam, an organization working to alleviate poverty and inequality around the world, found that 204 new billionaires were minted in 2024. In the U.S. alone—where wealth concentration is particularly high—the net worth of billionaires billowed by about $3.9 billion on average each day last year and 74 new billionaires emerged.  “The capture of our global economy by a privileged few has reached heights once considered unimaginable,” said Oxfam International Executive Director Amitabh Behar. “The failure to stop billionaires is now spawning soon-to-be trillionaires. Not only has the rate of billionaire wealth accumulation accelerated—by three times—but so too has their power,” he added.  Oxfam noted that the power of billionaires will be on particular display not just at the Davos WEF this week but also in Washington D.C, where Donald Trump will on Monday begin his second presidential term.  According to Oxfam, Trump’s team will be the richest ever to run the U.S. government, worth more than an estimated $450 billion. So far, at least 13 billionaires have been appointed to jobs in his administration, Oxfam concluded, and even excluding Elon Musk, who reportedly spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump win November's election, the cabinet would be the richest in history.  Musk, currently has an estimated net worth of around $427 billion, making him the richest individual on the planet, followed by Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, at around $237 billion, and Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, at around $211 billion. All three are expected to attend Trump’s inauguration. According to Forbes, Trump’s net worth grew from about $2.5 billion to an estimated $6.1 billion during the course of 2024, thanks in part to his majority stake in Truth Social’s parent company.  “We present this report as a stark wake up-call that ordinary people the world over are being crushed by the enormous wealth of a tiny few,” Behar said.  Oxfam’s research also found that more than a third of billionaire wealth is now inherited. Last year, a report by investment bank UBS about the super-rich, found that over the previous decade, multigenerational billionaires had inherited a total of $1.3 trillion.  “The ultra-rich like to tell us that getting rich takes skill, grit and hard work. But the truth is most wealth is taken, not made,” said Behar. “So many of the so-called ‘self-made’ are actually heirs to vast fortunes, handed down through generations of unearned privilege.” Earlier this month, a major survey conducted across 36 nations showed that economic inequality is now a grave public concern around the world, with many people particularly worried about the influence that the super-rich are having on policies and business decisions that exacerbate the wealth gap. The survey of more than 40,000 adults, done by the Pew Research Center last year and published in early January, found that a median of 54% of respondents across the countries said that they thought the chasm between the rich and poor was a very big problem in their nation. A further 30% said that they thought it was a moderately big problem. A median of 60%, meanwhile, said that the political influence enjoyed by the wealthiest individuals was a major contributor to economic inequality. These views, Pew found, were particularly common among respondents identifying as being on the ideological left, though many of those who identified as being on the right agreed too. Ideological divisions, the research showed, were especially large in the U.S.  The WEF meeting this year takes place from Jan. 20 to Jan. 24. This year’s theme is “Collaboration for the Intelligent Age.” The annual Davos meetings were first launched in 1971 to champion stakeholder capitalism but over the decades they’ve become a punching bag for social justice advocates, largely because of the extreme wealth of many of the attendees. This year—with many wars raging around the world—armed conflict is likely to top the agenda and dominate conversations during the four days in the Alpine town. Donald Trump is expected to address the meeting on Jan. 23.",

        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "The Giving Pledge is a charitable campaign, launched in 2010 by Bill and Melinda French Gates and Warren Buffett, that invites the world’s wealthiest individuals and families to publicly commit to giving away at least 50% of their wealth to philanthropy, either during their lifetimes or in their wills. The Institute for Policy Studies’ report “The Giving Pledge at 15” finds that the initiative—where billionaires publicly pledge to give at least half their wealth to charity—remains mostly unfulfilled, with most signatories far wealthier now than when they joined, and a majority of charitable giving funneled into private foundations and donor-advised funds rather than directly supporting operational charities. The IPS team, led by Chuck Collins, Bella DeVaan, Helen Flannery, and Dan Petergorsky, invites the public to examine its data and methodology. Collins is himself an Oscar Mayer heir who gave away his fortune and has dedicated his career to researching wealth inequality. Few have fulfilled the pledge, according to the IPS calculations. Only one set of living 2010 Pledgers (Laura and John Arnold) have actually given away half their wealth. Among the 22 deceased U.S. Pledgers, only eight met their pledge before death—just one, Chuck Feeney, gave away his entire fortune while alive. The pledge is a public, moral commitment rather than a legally binding contract; participants sign an open letter explaining their reasons for giving and can choose which causes and charities to support. The initiative was designed to inspire generosity, set new norms for billionaire philanthropy, and shift how major wealth is used to address pressing social challenges The report advocates returning to the “giving while living” ethos exemplified by Chuck Feeney, and calls for systemic reforms to ensure charitable donations serve the public interest—not just the tax and legacy interests of the ultra-rich. The report “raises important questions, but excludes “significant forms of charitable giving,” The Giving Pledge said in a statement to Fortune. “For fifteen years, the Giving Pledge has helped create new norms of generosity and grown into a connected and active global learning community. The recent IPS report raises important questions that aim to encourage greater giving,” the organization said. “Unfortunately, the report’s reliance on incomplete data, and its exclusion of significant forms of charitable giving—such as gifts made to foundations and other intermediaries—paints a misleading picture of the impact and intent of Giving Pledge signatories and the spirit and intent of the Giving Pledge.” For this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

        "title": "Billionaires are multiplying, and 60% earn their wealth through ‘inheritance, cronyism, or monopoly power,’ Oxfam writes",
        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "With each passing week in 2024 almost four new members joined the growing class of the ultra-rich, according to a recent report by anti-poverty advocacy firm Oxfam. The richest individuals in the world are doing a victory lap after last year, as billionaire wealth increased three times faster in 2024 than it did in 2023. In total, billionaire wealth skyrocketed by $2 trillion, adding more than 200 individuals to this cohort. The accumulation of riches at the very top is going so unchecked that Oxfam estimates  there will be five trillionaires within the coming decade. But nothing all that golden is minting these new wealthy individuals.“Most billionaire wealth is taken, not earned, 60% comes from either inheritance, cronyism and corruption or monopoly power,” Oxfam writes in the report.  Wealthy families are passing down trillions of dollars in wealth per year, creating “a new aristocratic oligarchy that has immense power in our politics and our economy,”  according to Oxfam, which adds that more than a third (36%) of billionaire wealth comes from family money.,  The ultra-wealthy are wielding a tight fist on their fortunes, keeping the ever-ballooning riches in the family. In the coming thirty years more than a thousand of the current billionaires will transfer more than $5.2 trillion to their heirs, writes Oxfam. Much of this transfer will go “largely untaxed,” the nonprofit writes. Two-thirds of countries studied in the report don’t tax inheritance to direct descendents. Beyond nepotism, the report finds that cronyism is a major driver of wealth. Cronyism refers to the bankrolling and backing of friends, especially when it comes to the appointments and lobbying of a political system. Oxfam estimates that 6% of the ultra-wealthy riches are from “crony sources,” while countries with lax regulations tend to produce more billionaires Lastly, billionaires have maintained their winning streak by the power of unmitigated monopolies. Calling out Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ domain of online purchases in many countries and Aliko Dangote’s hold on cement in Nigeria, Oxfam says that about 18% of billionaires’ wealth comes from said sole ownership.  In his farewell address, President Biden warned of a “oligarchy,” which threatened the fabric of democracy. Indeed, the total net worth of the 100 wealthiest citizens soared by $1.5 trillion from 2021 until 2024, per Bloomberg. “The election of Donald Trump as U.S. President in November gave a huge further boost to billionaire fortunes, while his policies – such as gigantic tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and corporations – are set to fan the flames of inequality further,” writes Oxfam. A number of the world’s richest men flanked President Trump during his inauguration, including Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla’s Elon Musk. It wasn’t just Silicon Valley CEOs who showed their support. LVMH’s chief Bernard Arnault and his family were in attendance as well as India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani. The collective worth of said billionaires attending reached a whopping $1.35 trillion, according to Forbes. The individual wealth of the richest 10 men in the world increased last year by almost $100 million on an average day, per Oxfam. “When the 3 wealthiest men in America sit behind Trump at his inauguration, everyone understands that the billionaire class now controls our government,” tweeted Senator Bernie Sanders of what he deemed an oligarchy. “We must fight back,” he wrote. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

        "text": "Published Aug 13, 2025 at 07:30 AM EDT Institute for Policy Studies The Giving Pledge just turned 15. Bill Gates, Melinda French, and Warren Buffett founded the Pledge in August 2010 to boost charitable giving among billionaires. Pledgers agree to give away half or more of their wealth within their lifetimes, or upon their deaths. The effort was inspired by Duty Free Shoppers founder Chuck Feeney, the reluctant billionaire who advocated \"giving while living.\" Feeney gave away over $8 billion before he died, relinquishing his billionaire status to live a more modest life. \"[Feeney] told me we should encourage people not to give just 50 percent,\" Gates recounted, \"but as much as possible during their lifetime.\" The Giving Pledge is the largest and most visible public commitment that billionaires have made to distribute their vast fortunes. Over 256 individuals, couples, and families have signed, including 194 from the United States. Our tax code's charitable deductions effectively allow billionaires to \"opt out\" of taxes—ostensibly to give back through charity. In the absence of higher taxes on the wealthy that could fund a stronger social safety net, voluntary commitments like the Giving Pledge are important. But in an era of staggering wealth inequality—and tax avoidance—privately held fortunes are larger than anyone can fathom. And charitable contributions simply aren't keeping up with what could be raised from a fairer tax code. In our new report, The Giving Pledge at 15, we found that the explosive growth of Giving Pledgers' wealth is outpacing their giving. At this rate, the Giving Pledge appears to be mostly an empty promise. Along with our co-authors Helen Flannery and Dan Petegorsky, we analyzed the philanthropic records of the pledgers. Some are bold and direct, like MacKenzie Scott, who's vowed to \"keep at it until the safe is empty.\" Others need to pick up the pace, like John Paul DeJoria, whose foundation has awarded $54 million since its inception eight years ago—a paltry sum compared to his roughly $3 billion fortune. And there are those who seem to cravenly intertwine personal benefit with philanthropy—like Elon Musk, who in 2021 enjoyed some fortuitously timely tax relief from a stock transfer to his foundation. Across nearly every example, there's proof that the Pledge is unfulfilled, unfulfillable, and not our ticket to a fairer, better future. If hundreds of billionaires pledge to give away half their wealth in their lifetimes, we should expect that some would have less wealth than when they took the Pledge. But when adjusted for inflation, the 32 original U.S. pledgers who are still billionaires have collectively gotten 166 percent wealthier since they signed on in 2010. (Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan's wealth has increased an inflation-adjusted 2,919 percent since 2010!) Only one couple in this group, Laura and John Arnold, has fulfilled their commitment, moving billions in their lifetime—mostly to their own foundation. But that raises another issue. By our count, 80 percent of Giving Pledge donations have gone to private foundations—and billions more to other intermediaries. Donors get an immediate tax deduction, but the funds can remain sidelined for generations before they're granted out to real working charities—if ever. Play this out another 15 years and we'll witness the rise of family-controlled dynastic foundations worth trillions. These foundations will wield tremendous power, especially as their windfalls contrast with catastrophic cuts to the social safety net like those in the GOP's Big Beautiful Bill. A select few families will essentially decide how publicly subsidized funds are spent, concentrating power over our politics and civil society and jeopardizing our democracy. At 15, the Giving Pledge must either go big or reconsider its value. One path forward is to encourage a \"Feeney Giving Pledge,\" an augmented commitment for existing pledgers to pay their fair share of taxes, give more while alive, and empower organizations led by non-billionaires to solve the urgent problems of our day. Feeney's example echoed in Bill Gates's May announcement that he would donate 99 percent of his Microsoft stock to his foundation, which he's pledged to wind down and close within 20 years. This voluntary effort would pair nicely with structural reforms. We should tax billionaires at a fair rate. And taxpayer-subsidized foundations and donor-advised funds (DAFs) should be subject to stronger transparency rules—and required to grant out funds to real, working charities more quickly. If billionaires' best intentions can't deliver a fairer economy, then it's up to the rest of us not to count on them.

(Michael Buholzer/Keystone via AP)                                \n DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — Billionaires’ wealth grew three times faster in 2024 than the year before, a top anti-poverty group reported on Monday as some of the world’s political and financial elite prepared for an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland. Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.  OxFam’s research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Joe Biden last week of a “dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.” The group’s sharp-edged report, titled “Takers Not Makers,” also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.  The World Economic Forum expects to host some 3,000 attendees, including business executives, academics, government officials, and civic group leaders at its annual meeting in the Alpine village of Davos. The first big day of meetings starts Tuesday, after a largely ceremonial start on Monday. \n Expect U.S. President Donald Trump’s return to the White House to be a topic of formal conversations and off-the-cuff remarks. Policy experts are participating in a Tuesday morning panel titled, “47th US Presidency, Early Thoughts” and a town hall called “State of Play: U.S. Dollar.”  Ukrianian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are scheduled to deliver speeches at Davos on Tuesday.  President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia, an avowed supporter of Trump, took a wait-and-see attitude before Trump gave his inaugural address on Monday. Vucic said he and his team would spend the evening analyzing the speech.  “Everybody hopes that Trump will bring new ambition and new energy” into resolving the Russia-Ukraine war, the Serbian leader told The Associated Press. “I hope that Trump will do something in very concrete terms.” Trump’s first speech of his second presidency was heavy on domestic issues, but he said “my proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier” and alluded to a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza that took effect on Sunday. Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term, was expected to take part in the forum’s event by video on Thursday.  Trump has long championed wealth accumulation — including his own — and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser. “What you’re seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,” Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk. “It’s not about one specific individual. It’s the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,” he added. Like Biden’s call for making billionaires “begin to pay their fair share” through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam — a global advocacy group — called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to “dismantle the new aristocracy.” The group called for steps like the break-up of monopolies, capping CEO pay, and regulation of corporations to ensure they pay “living wages” to workers. Many investors racked up strong gains in 2024, with strong performances for top tech companies and stock-market indexes like the S&P 500, as well as the price of gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Oxfam said billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion last year, or roughly $5.7 billion a day, three-times faster than in 2023. The number of billionaires rose by 204 to 2,769, and the 10 richest men saw their wealth rise nearly $100 million a day on average, it said. Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has “barely changed” since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaire List” as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich. By contrast, at least four new billionaires were “minted” every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or “crony connections,” it said. Despite the growing gap between the rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab will likely focus again on money- and deal-making money, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world.  The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries.  As in past years, protesters calling for more economic equality, taxing the rich and pressing other demands took to the streets. Some blocked roads to Davos, snarling traffic in places and delaying trips for some attendees to the event, which runs through Friday.  \n \n  \n \n Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Oxfam found that it would take a staggering 726,000 years for 10 US workers at median earnings to make that much money.\n     \n            The findings put an exclamation point on the nation‚Äôs wealth inequality and come as Republicans debate a costly bill that nonpartisan experts say will make the rich even richer and deeply cut nearly $1 trillion from key safety net programs.\n     \n            ‚ÄúBillionaire wealth has increased astronomically while so many ordinary people struggle to make ends meet,‚Äù Rebecca Riddell, senior policy lead for economic and racial justice at Oxfam America, said in the report.\n     \n            To measure the gains of the richest, Oxfam measured the estimated wealth shifts of the top 10 on the Forbes Real Time Billionaire List between the end of April 2024 and the end of April 2025.\n     \n            Elon Musk, the world‚Äôs richest person and CEO of Tesla, accounts for just over half of the total wealth gains, with his net worth spiking by $186.1 billion over that span. An analysis last fall found that Musk, a pivotal figure in President Donald Trump‚Äôs return to the White House, is on track to become the world‚Äôs first trillionaire.\n     \n            The net worths of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg and Walmart heir Rob Walton increased by $38.7 billion apiece. Legendary investor Warren Buffett gained $34.8 billion in wealth, while Walmart heir Jim Walton gained $36.5 billion. Some billionaires such as Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin lost wealth over that span.\n     \n            Oxfam argues that the Republican bill, a legislative priority of Trump, would further stack the deck against ordinary people in favor of the most affluent.\n     \n            ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing a tax code being designed that would bring about the world‚Äôs first trillionaire,‚Äù Riddell said.\n     \n            Some progressives have called for fighting inequality by imposing a wealth tax on ultra-millionaires and billionaires. Oxfam found that a 3% tax on wealth above $1 billion would raise $50 billion from the 10 richest Americans alone ‚Äì enough to provide food assistance for one year to 22.5 million people.\n     \n            Of course, taxing wealth would be very challenging, in part because it can be hard to value net worth. And some legal scholars have questioned whether a wealth tax is even constitutional.\n     \n            Lawmakers are debating whether and how to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Trump‚Äôs signature tax law. The bill that has advanced in the House would make permanent essentially all of the individual income tax breaks from the 2017 law and temporarily cut taxes on tips and overtime.\n     \n            The legislation, known as the ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,‚Äù would increase resources to US households, on average, according to a new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). However, these gains would not be distributed evenly.\n     \n            Household resources would drop by 4% in 2033 for the bottom 10% of earners, the CBO found. By contrast, the top 10% of earners would gain 2% over that span due to lower taxes.\n     \n            The legislation would increase the nation‚Äôs economic output, measured by gross domestic product (GDP), by 0.5% in 10 years and 1.7% in 30 years, according to an analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Those economic gains would be fueled by higher savings and labor supply, incentivized by a weaker social safety net, Penn Wharton found.\n     \n            The bill‚Äôs gains would go disproportionately to the rich, according to the analysis. The top 10% of earners would receive about two-thirds (65%) of the total value of the legislation, while households in the bottom 20% would lose about $1,035 in 2026 due to cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and other changes, according to Penn Wharton.\n     \n            Kent Smetters, professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Wharton School, told CNN that the top 10% of households would get about $3.1 trillion worth of tax cuts over 10 years.

        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "President Donald Trump’s tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories are causing havoc across the global market, with the S&P 500 nearing bear market territory early Monday. These dramatic market declines are hurting investors small and large—from the 401(k) savings accounts of single families to the elaborate holdings of the world’s richest individuals. In fact, Warren Buffett, Larry Ellison, and Mark Zuckerberg each lost close to $10 billion by the end of the trading day on Friday alone, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index; the world’s 500 richest people experienced the biggest two-day losses ever on April 3 and 4, thanks in part to popular tech stocks like Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta seeing billions in value wiped out. And even those close to Trump are feeling the pain. Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, has lost the most of any person on Earth. On Friday, his net worth declined by $20 billion—with year-to-date declines totaling over $130 billion. Despite the losses, he’s still the world’s richest man. Many signs point to further economic turmoil. European, Asian, and American markets all tumbled to start the trading week and could set the stage for one of the biggest declines in billionaire wealth in memory. One widely known billionaire sticks out from the rest due to his stock market gains remaining positive in 2025. Warren Buffett appears to have predicted a market turn coming. He sold some $134 billion in equities in 2024 and was sitting on $334 billion in cash at the end of the year. In 2025, he is up by about $12 billion and is the sixth-richest person in the world, just behind Bill Gates and Bernard Arnault. Read more from Fortune   “We were aided by a predictable large gain in investment income as Treasury Bill yields improved and we substantially increased our holdings of these highly-liquid short-term securities,” Buffett wrote to shareholders in February. While Buffett, too, lost billions last week, his better performance could also be tied to his heads-down approach of staying away from politics—or his simple attitude that prioritizes being thrifty and sensible. Buffett is one of the longest-serving members of the billionaire club, a group that saw record growth in 2024—with the wealth of the richest of the rich increasing three times faster than the year before. Moreover, in early January, billionaires were earning some $10 billion a day and holding more wealth than any country except for the U.S. and China. If the stock market conditions continue to trend down, a tide could turn on the growing wealth of billionaires, but the losses may not feel as significant as they may for the Americans who were hoping to retire this year or are struggling to grapple with inflation and a frustrating job market. Nearly three-fourths of all Americans believe wealth inequality is a “serious national issue,” according to a recent survey, and 46% conclude that billionaires hoarding wealth make it harder for ordinary people to achieve the American Dream.

        "title": "Disney heiress says any billionaire who can’t manage to share their wealth is 'kind of a sociopath'",
        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "Sydney Lake is an associate editor at Fortune, where she writes and edits news for the publication's global news desk. While many of the world’s wealthiest people make an effort to share their fortunes, some do not—at least to the extent more generous peers wish they would.  Abigail Disney, one of the heiresses to the Walt Disney fortune who said in 2019 she’s worth about $120 million, shared her feelings about how much of their wealth billionaires should be willing to share.\n\n\n\n “I am of the belief that every billionaire who can’t live on $999 million is kind of a sociopath,” Disney told the Guardian in an interview published in April. “Like, why? You know, over a billion dollars makes money so fast that it’s almost impossible to get rid of.”\n\n\n\n Disney has begrudgingly disclosed her net worth in the past only to make a point about how important it is to her to give away the vast fortune bestowed upon her by being a part of one of the major family dynasties in the U.S. The Financial Times even called her a “class warrior” for how vocal she’s been about how much the wealthiest should be taxed. \n\n\n\n “The need to tax rich people like me has never been so dire,” Disney wrote in a 2024 op-ed titled, “World Leaders Have a Chance to Raise Taxes for Rich People Like Me. I’m Begging Them to Take It,” published by the Guardian. “Extreme wealth concentration in the hands of a few oligarchs is a threat to democracy the world over.” \n Disney was also behind a 2019 letter signed by financier George Soros and Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes calling for a “moderate wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest one-tenth of the richest 1% of Americans—on us.”\n\n\n\n The Disney heiress and filmmaker in 1991 also founded the Daphne Foundation, a New York City–based nonprofit that invests funds for causes like fighting poverty, violence, and discrimination. The organization had donated about $70 million as of 2019.\n\n\n\n Although Disney has said she had given away about a third of her net worth, it came “back to me as quickly as I’ve given it away,” referencing how investments can grow wealth.\n\n\n\n “By just sitting on your hands, you become more of a billionaire until you’re a double billionaire,” Disney told the Guardian. “It’s a strange way to live when you have objectively more money than a person can spend.”\n\n\n\n Other ultrawealthy people have been giving vast amounts of their fortunes away. One prime example is MacKenzie Scott, who’s donated more than $19 billion of her $34.3 billion fortune. In September she made one of her largest gifts: a $70 million donation to historically Black colleges and universities. The five-year donation spree by the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has been “transformational” for nonprofits, according to a study by the Center for Effective Philanthropy.  \n “It could take decades to truly understand the effects these gifts have had on nonprofits and the sector at large,” according to the report. “However, after five years of giving, the reported effects of her gifts on recipient organizations…remain overwhelmingly positive.”\n\n\n\n Bill and Melinda French Gates, major philanthropists, have given away more than $100 billion since founding the Gates Foundation in 2000. \n\n\n\n “I believe that people who are financially successful have a responsibility to give back to society,” Bill Gates wrote on his blog Gates Notes. “In the 1990s, as Microsoft became successful, I decided I would eventually give away virtually all of my wealth. The goal of my philanthropy is to reduce inequity.”\n\n\n\n Although French Gates resigned from the Gates Foundation in 2024, she put out an open call for nonprofits related to the betterment of women and girls to apply for grants through her organization, Pivotal, pledging to donate $1 billion during the next two years. French Gates’ net worth is about $16.8 billion, according to Bloomberg.\n By “using my own personal resources to put substantial investments behind women or minorities,” she told NPR in October 2024, “I am pointing in a direction, I hope, for other philanthropists or even other governments.” Fortune reported in May the Gates Foundation will end in 2045. \n And Warren Buffett, the sixth-richest man in the world with a $155 billion net worth, also pledged in 2010 to give away more than 99% of his wealth to philanthropy during his lifetime or at his death. In June, Buffett donated another $6 billion in Berkshire Hathaway shares—with the lion’s share going to the Gates Foundation.\n\n\n\n “Measured by dollars, this commitment is large. In a comparative sense, though, many individuals give more to others every day,” Buffett wrote. “In contrast, my family and I will give up nothing we need or want by fulfilling this 99% pledge.”\n\n\n\n A version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on April 7, 2025.\n  Join the conversation: Attend Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit in Riyadh this May. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

        "title": "America's wealthy have too much power. It's hurting democracy – and our economy. | Your Turn",
        "domain": "usatoday.com",
        "text": "If there's one thing the Trump administration has a surplus of, it's billionaires. President Donald Trump himself is America's first billionaire president, boasting a net worth of $5.3 billion, according to Forbes. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found the median weekly earnings for U.S. workers was $1,194 in the first quarter of 2025 – or $62,088 a year. At that rate, it would take the average American roughly 85,350 years to reach Trump's net worth. Meanwhile, the total net worth of the billionaires who make up Trump's changing administration – including former friend Elon Musk, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent among them – equals at least $450 billion. And that money buys a lot of influence – and power. Maybe too much. That's the question we asked you. As part of our Opinion Forum, we asked USA TODAY readers what you thought about the growing power of billionaires: in our corporations, in our markets and, yes, in our government. Is this exorbitant wealth something to aspire to? Or is it a threat? Read the responses below. I do think the wealthy have too much power. Who listens to someone making minimum wage? (I'm speaking, by the way, as a former sociology professor, jail administrator and jail standards specialist.) Having a large number of very wealthy people in political power also has a negative effect on our democracy. The richer people are, the less they are in tune with the common people they are supposed to represent. The growth in the number of billionaires and in their collective wealth is not a sign of a healthy economy. A healthy economy is defined by a more equal income distribution. In the 1980s, CEOs earned about 40 times more than their hourly employees. Today it's about 300 times. There is something horribly wrong with this picture! I do think taxes should be raised on the the richest people in our country. The wealthy are not paying their fair share. They sit back in their mansions and yachts while the rest of us are desperately trying to keep our canoes afloat. — Bev Scott, Trinity, Texas Without data directly on hand about how much people in different income strata contribute to the federal budget, it’s hard to answer questions like whether we should raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans. But I'm in my 70s and have witnessed many things. My parents and their parents worked until they died. That work ethic comes with compensation. Some do better than others. The common thread is working. I support the work requirements for Medicaid recently approved by Congress and signed into law. The details are rarely published. The headlines are almost always divisive and incomplete.  Let’s stop accusing the wealthy as if they are criminals. They pay most of the taxes and give a tremendous amount to philanthropy. Google it! Get the best education you can afford. Get a job that adds value to your life and work hard. Vote in every election. And try your best to live a good life. Stop judging others. — Rick Bateman, Loveland, Ohio Our distribution of wealth is completely out of balance and will have dire consequences. I have no argument against infinite personal wealth as long as every citizen has access to basic essentials. Food, medical care, shelter, public safety, etc. should be a foundation for the populace. The uber wealthy can have all the mansions they want once everyone has a roof. Wealth is achieved through more than business acumen. Billionaires exist because they utilize economic and civic infrastructure, provided collectively by all of us. Their argument that \"I did it\" is, at best, specious. Without fundamental change, this will end badly. — Sam Collins, Gainesville, Florida The increased involvement of billionaires in our government has a huge effect on how our system operates. The ultra rich have always held sway over American democracy, but the days of their political dealings being done behind the scenes are long gone. Now, it's not only out in public every day that billionaires are controlling the government and looking to alter the country in such a way to elevate themselves even further above the average person, but it's also that a huge portion of the American public, most of them people who will be affected negatively by these actions, is still hugely supportive of this regime. This means that the country can continue to be run in such a way that the marginalized are stomped on while the rich get richer. It is now to the point that the Trump regime can brazenly break laws and defy courts with few to no repercussions, and this is, surely enough, eroding away the foundation of American democracy. — Ben Rivera, Salt Lake City",

        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "No one was in a better mood last week than Larry Ellison—the Oracle cofounder shot up Forbes’billionaire rankings list, reaching the number two spot, right below his close friend Elon Musk. Ellison’s net worth now stands tall at $250.9 billion after Oracle’s recent earnings report triggered its shares to skyrocket.  With approximately 41% of Oracle’s shares in his name, the cloud-computing mogul saw his net worth climb by over $40 billion in a matter of days. On Thursday last week, his fortune grew by $25 billion, and increased by another $16 billion on Friday: easily two of the largest daily swells in billionaire net worth that week, according to Forbes.  Now Ellison has overtaken Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, who is currently worth $229 billion, and Mark Zuckerberg, who has a $240 billion net worth, in the billionaires club. The one person he hasn’t topped yet is Elon Musk—Ellison’s close friend, who is still the world’s wealthiest man with $405 billion in riches. There’s nearly a $155 billion difference between their respective net worths, so Ellison has his work cut out for him if he ever hopes to reach number one.  Last Wednesday, the afternoon earnings report was dubbed a “watershed” moment for the cloud-computing company. It was also a big moment for Ellison’s wallet.  The report shows Oracle’s total revenue for the 2025 fiscal year rose by 8%, reaching a whopping $57.4 billion. The $1.70 adjusted earnings per share outperformed Wall Street’s expectations, alongside its unprecedented $15.9 billion in sales. One day after these figures were released, Oracle’s stock soared by 13%—and by midafternoon Friday, it rose another 7% to a record of $215 per share.  Ellison, the chairman and CTO of Oracle, subsequently enjoyed an 11-figure surge in net worth. Last Tuesday afternoon, the day before the cloud-computing titan released its earnings report, Ellison’s net worth stood at $213 billion.  While the 80-year-old entrepreneur may feel on top of the world right now, there’s no telling where he’ll be in 2026. Billionaires’ wealth fluctuates all the time—Bernard Arnault, founder and CEO of luxury fashion house LVMH, was the world’s richest person at the start of 2024 with $231 billion. Today, he’s in seventh place with a net worth of $142 billion, thanks to tumbling stocks. However, TD Cowen analyst Derrick Wood said Oracle’s 2026 fiscal year, starting this month, will be a “major inflection point” for the business’ cloud infrastructure services, propelled by “massive demand for AI training workloads.” And Ellison himself sees the promise of what lies ahead.  “Oracle’s future is bright in this new era of cloud computing. Oracle will be the number one cloud database company,” Ellison said in the business’ earnings call last Friday. “Oracle is already prospering in this new era of cloud computing and AI, and it’s just the beginning.” Ellison sees the next year as a new frontier for Oracle, which could mean another big payout for the executive. But even if he takes the number one spot for the world’s richest person, Musk probably won’t have hard feelings—after all, they’re good friends.  “I am not sure how many people know, but I’m very close friends with Elon Musk, and I’m a big investor in Tesla,” Ellison said during a 2018 conference call with analysts. Ellison and Musk are two peas in a pod—both are wildly successful tech entrepreneurs with big personalities. The Oracle cofounder has repeatedly defended Musk, arguing against public backlash that he “doesn’t know what he’s doing,” saying he “loved” articles about the Tesla founder “smoking dope.”   In 2018, Musk even appointed Ellison to his Tesla board, drawing scrutiny from critics who argued it’s harder to maintain objectivity with friends on corporate boards.  Emma Burleigh is a reporter at Fortune, covering success, careers, entrepreneurship, and personal finance.

        "domain": "theguardian.com",
        "text": "Wealth of world’s richest tycoons shrinks as US president’s trade war spooks investors With global stock markets reeling from Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping border taxes, some of the US president’s business allies have been left counting the cost. The world’s 500 richest people lost a collective $536bn (£417bn) in the first two days of stock market trading after Trump’s “liberation day” announcement last Wednesday. It was the biggest two-day loss of wealth ever recorded by Bloomberg’s billionaires index. Within that, a coterie of tycoons who have supported Trump or attended his inauguration in January have seen their wealth shrink. Here, we look at the four who have been worst hit by the market turmoil – and one billionaire still riding high this year. The world’s richest man and the chief executive of Tesla – who has already seen his wealth drop precipitously after becoming a high-profile and controversial figure in Trump’s administration – has taken the biggest hit by some margin. Tesla was already facing a potential buyer backlash over its CEO’s controversial behaviour, and as its shares plunged, $31bn was wiped off Musk’s net worth between the opening bell on Thursday and the market closing on Friday. The recent fall in Tesla’s stock has meant his private rockets and satellites business, SpaceX, became his most valuable asset. So far this year, Musk’s estimated wealth has fallen by $130bn, although he still comfortably remains the world’s richest person, with a net worth of $302bn. Tesla’s shares fell nearly 5% on Wall Street on Monday afternoon, adding to these losses. The Facebook founder and owner of Instagram and WhatsApp had the next biggest loss, at more than $27bn. The world’s third richest person, with an estimated net worth of $179bn, was hit by a plunge in the value of Meta. Its stock dropped almost 14% over two days as the tariff war hit tech companies particularly hard. Its stock edged slightly higher on Monday, up almost 1%. Many of the world’s biggest companies rely on markets in Asia, which had the heaviest tariffs imposed on them by Trump, for manufacturing, computer chips and IT services. Zuckerberg, who performed a remarkable “Trump pivot” of Meta weeks before Trump took office, has seen more than $28bn wiped off his personal fortune so far this year. The Amazon founder and Washington Post owner had the next biggest two-day loss, at $23.5bn. The market value of Amazon, a leading seller of imported goods from around the world, has fallen by hundreds of billions of dollars this year. China-based sellers have more than a 50% market share of Amazon’s third-party marketplace, while its cloud services business also relies on tech produced primarily by manufacturers in Asian countries, such as Taiwan. Bezos, the world’s second richest person, with a net worth estimated at $193bn, has seen $45bn wiped off his fortune so far this year. Amazon’s shares were marginally higher – up 0.4% - on Monday. In February, Bezos’s $10bn climate and biodiversity fund halted funding to one of the world’s most important climate-certification organisations, in a move viewed by some as a “bowing down” to Trump and his opposition to climate action. The owner of the LVMH luxury goods empire lost $6bn on Thursday and more than $5bn on Friday as Trump’s tariffs hit the Asian factory hubs that underpin the global garment industry. Shares fell even further on Monday, by more than 4%. The net worth of Europe’s richest person, and the fourth wealthiest individual in the world according to Bloomberg, has dropped to $158bn – down $18.6bn so far this year. Arnault has been friends with Trump since the early 1980s when they met at a charity dinner, and the US is his business empire’s largest market, equal in size to all European sales. Arnault, also known as the “wolf in cashmere”, had prime seats at Trump’s second inauguration along with his wife, son and daughter. “I have just returned from the US, and I have witnessed the winds of optimism in that country,” he said on his return. “Coming back to France is a bit like taking a cold shower.” A 20% tariff has since been imposed on the EU, while key countries for garment manufacturing in Asia have tariffs of up to 54%. Not all billionaires have seen their net worth decrease, despite the two-day rout. The canny chair and largest shareholder in the investment company Berkshire Hathaway, known as the “sage of Omaha”, has seen his wealth increase to $155bn this year. The world’s sixth richest person, whose annual shareholder meetings have been called “Woodstock for capitalists”, did take a $2.57bn hit in the two-day meltdown, but he has seen $12.7bn added to his net wealth so far this year. On Friday, Trump shared a video on his social media site, Truth Social, that erroneously claimed Buffett had praised his recent economic policies. Berkshire Hathaway subsequently issued a statement saying reports on social media attributing comments to Buffett were false. Its stock fell just over 2% in early afternoon trading on Monday.",

        "domain": "forbes.com",
        "text": "ByChase Peterson-Withorn, Forbes Staff. “This is what victory feels like,” Elon Musk declared the day Donald Trump was sworn in. “I'm super fired up for the future…One of the most American values that I love is optimism.” Now, as Donald Trump begins his 100th day back in office, much of the optimism has faded as the American stock market has gotten off to its worst start in 50 years, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both dropping by nearly 8% amid Trump’s tariff war. No one has been hit harder than Musk, who is $45 billion poorer than he was on Trump’s second inauguration day. Musk has taken to feuding with Trump tariff hawk Peter Navarro on social media, has said he will step back from leading Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, and has had to refocus on his electric carmaker Tesla, after tariff fears and Musk’s increasingly unpopular political efforts have sent the stock crashing 33%. He isn’t the only billionaire down big during Trump 2.0. Overall, America’s 800-some billionaires are $300 billion poorer since January 20. Joining Musk among the 10 biggest losers (in sheer dollar terms) are Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Alphabet’s Sergey Brin and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, three tech tycoons who scored prominent seats just behind the first family at Trump’s inauguration—and have since gone on to lose $35 billion, $26 billion and $22 billion in wealth, respectively. Other prominent Trump backers have dropped billions, too. Oracle’s Larry Ellison—who met with Trump the day after the inauguration as part of a $500 billion an AI infrastructure initiative—is America’s third-biggest loser so far, behind Musk and Bezos, down $28 billion. Blackstone cofounder Stephen Schwarzman, who initially said he would not support longtime friend’s 2024 campaign but soon backtracked, is $11 billion poorer. Of course some billionaires have managed to get richer despite the shaky markets. Warren Buffett—who called tariffs “an act of war, to some degree” ahead of Trump’s announcement—has kept Berkshire Hathaway steady, stashing a record $334 billion of the conglomerate’s money in cash and cash equivalents. That has helped push shares up 13% since Trump took office, adding nearly $20 billion to the Oracle of Omaha’s net worth. Other big billionaire winners so far: Peter Thiel (up $4.9 billion) and Alexander Karp ($3.6 billion), whose AI-powered data mining firm Palantir is America’s hottest stock, thanks in part to defense and software contracts with U.S. government agencies. The three surviving children of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992), meanwhile, are each at least $3 billion richer, as consumers have flocked to the retail giant amid elevated inflation; last week, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon met with Trump to argue against tariffs. And while former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who has kept much of his wealth in the tech giant’s stock, losing $8 billion so far in the process, founder Bill Gates has diversified his fortune into a wide range of investments, including a 35% stake in waste company Republic Services (up 15%), helping make him a big gainer. President Trump, meanwhile, has not been kind to businessman Trump. The commander-in-chief’s fortune is down $1.5 billion since he took charge of the U.S. government, as shares of his Trump Media & Technology Group—the parent company of Truth Social—have plunged by 35%, quadruple the broader market’s drop. He’s clearly paying attention to the gyrations. Standing in the Oval Office on April 9, Trump pointed to brokerage billionaire Charles Schwab: “He made $2.5 billion today,” he bragged, then turned to automotive billionaire Roger Penske: “And he made $900 million.” Both fortunes have continued to climb since then, but after racking up huge losses earlier in Trump’s first 100 days, Schwab is only $375 million, or 3%, richer than he was on the last day of Joe Biden’s presidency. Penske, meanwhile, is $1.1 billion poorer.",

(Kenny Holston/The New York Times via AP, Pool)       \n ATLANTA (AP) — President Donald Trump’s brash populism has always involved incongruence: the billionaire businessman-politician stirring the passions of millions who, regardless of the U.S. economy’s trajectory, could never afford to live in his Manhattan skyscraper or visit his club in south Florida. His second White House is looking a lot like the inside of Mar-a-Lago, with extremely wealthy Americans taking key roles in his Republican administration.  The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is overseeing a new Department of Government Efficiency. Billionaires or mega-millionaires are lined up to run the treasury, commerce, interior and education departments, NASA and the Small Business Administration, and fill key foreign posts.  “He’s bringing in folks who have had great success in the private sector,” said Debbie Dooley, an early 2015 Trump supporter and onetime national organizer in the anti-establishment Tea Party movement. “If you need to have brain surgery, you want the proven brain surgeons.” Others raise concerns about conflicts of interest at odds with Trump’s pledge to fight for “forgotten men and women” in a country where the median household net worth is about $193,000 and median annual household income is about $81,000. “It’s hard to conceive how the wealthiest set of Cabinet nominees and White House appointments in history will understand what average working people are going through,” said former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who served under President Bill Clinton and has warned for decades about the nation’s widening wealth and wage gaps. \n Countered Dooley: “Trump sets the agenda. If they won’t enact his policies, then they will hear him say what we hear on ‘The Apprentice’ all the time: ‘You’re fired!’” Here is a closer look at some of Trump’s picks, their net worth according to Forbes and Yahoo Finance, and what the choices could mean: Musk (net worth estimated above $400 billion) is chairing the new Department of Government Efficiency, which is a special commission charged with slashing federal spending. The extensive ties his businesses have to the government have raised questions about Musk’s potential conflicts in the role.  McMahon was picked to be Trump’s secretary of education. She is the wife of Vince McMahon, who is worth at least $3 billion. The former WWE wrestling executive will lead an agency that many conservatives have called for abolishing altogether. While that’s a heavy lift politically, McMahon and Trump have endorsed an expansion of “school choice,” programs that steer taxpayer money to private school tuition. She also could be in charge of implementing Trump’s proposals to withhold federal money from public schools — K-12 and higher education — that do not meet White House demands to modify or scrap diversity programs. The former North Dakota governor made his money as a software entrepreneur, selling his business to Microsoft for more than $1 billion in 2001. The latest federal financial disclosures show his personal holdings to include assets with ranges that exceed $100 million but do not provide a precise value of his net worth. Disclosure forms also do not require him to include certain trusts if Burgum himself is not the beneficiary. Burgum impressed Trump during his own failed bid for the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination. As interior secretary, Burgum will be charged with implementing Trump’s “Drill, baby, drill” promise — making it even easier for energy companies to tap fossil fuel resources, including from public lands. Forbes has not yet identified Bessent as a billionaire, but the veteran hedge fund manager confirmed Monday as treasury secretary certainly is worth many hundreds of millions. At Treasury, he will play key roles in selling and implementing a number of Trump’s signature policies: reinstating the 2017 tax cuts tilted to corporations and wealthy individuals, imposing tariffs on many imports and cutting taxes on overtime wages, Social Security benefits and tip income. Reich, the former labor secretary, noted that Bessent and his fellow wealthy Cabinet designees stand to benefit personally from Trump’s tax ideas. Trump tax policies, which helped widen the deficit in Trump’s first term, are juxtaposed with Bessent’s warnings about the dangers of rising U.S. debt and the cost of annual interest payments to the government’s bond holders. An apparent runner-up to head Treasury, Lutnick (estimated net worth $1.5 billion) has been nominated to be secretary of commerce. Lutnick, who made his fortune as a financial services executive, is still slated for a high-profile post that will put him at the center of Trump’s promised trade wars with China and other nations, including Mexico and Canada. Commerce also oversees several agencies, including the Census Bureau, whose calculations are key to determining the funding distributions of programs across the federal government. The Georgia businesswoman named to lead the Small Business Administration was the wealthiest member of the Senate during her brief stay on Capitol Hill. Loeffler is married to Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, the publicly traded firm that owns the New York Stock Exchange. That’s not the center of commerce for the SBA’s usual clientele. The agency was founded in 1953 and describes itself as “the only cabinet-level federal agency fully dedicated to small business” by providing “counseling, capital, and contracting expertise as the nation’s only go-to resource and voice for small businesses.” As a senator, Loeffler faced ethics complaints over alleged insider trading tied to stock trades she and her husband made as members of Congress first started receiving briefings related to the coronavirus pandemic. The trades occurred weeks before the pandemic caused markets to plummet. Justice Department and Senate inquiries later found no wrongdoing on Loeffler’s part. Isaacman, another financial services billionaire, was the first wealthy individual to take a space walk through Musk’s company, SpaceX. This choice, as much as any, illustrates Trump’s lean to the wealthy private sector, given that billionaires like Musk and Amazon chief Jeff Bezos are now competing in a space sector that was once the province of the federal government and the agency that Isaacman would lead as NASA administrator. __ An earlier version of this story erroneously stated that Doug Burgum has an estimated net worth of $1.1 billion. The latest federal financial disclosures show his personal holdings to include assets with ranges that exceed $100 million but do not provide a precise value of his net worth.  \n \n  \n \n Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "text": "I played a fictional billionaire on TV. It’s time world leaders got serious about taxing the real ones You could be forgiven for thinking the second coming of Donald Trump was fiction. Unfortunately, it’s not – the threat he and his “broligarchs” bring to people around the world is very, very real. Last month Trump, surrounded by his uber-rich friends,  was inaugurated the 47th president, while his political supporters sat outside in the cold – the perfect metaphor for who really matters in this presidency. Among the clique were the three richest men in the world: Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and top dog Elon Musk, who personally poured $277m into Trump’s election campaign, increasing his own wealth by $170bn as a result. Money equals power, so the saying goes, and right now it’s playing out on the world stage. As we know, Musk’s efforts to get Trump into the White House earned him a role heading up the new department of government efficiency – or Doge for short, conveniently echoing the same name of the cryptocurrency he promotes. A man born into wealth and privilege is advising the president on how the US should protect its cash, alongside about a dozen other billionaire officials. Meanwhile, the rest of the world lives in economic fear as the gap between the super-rich and everyone else quickly becomes a chasm. These super-rich people are so far out of touch with reality, it’s infuriating. Wealth is no longer about financial worth, it’s about control – of our democracies, societies, economies and planet. Trump’s appointees are just the latest example of how inequality and extreme wealth hurt us all. Billionaire wealth rose three times faster in 2024 than in 2023. Five trillionaires are now expected within a decade, according to data from Oxfam. Meanwhile, progress on global poverty has stalled. Inequality is out of control. On his first day back at the White House, Trump signed a slew of executive orders, winding back the clock of progress with every signature. He said he would only be a dictator on day one. Time will tell. Soon after, he took centre stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos among heads of state, politicians and business moguls who had jetted in for the annual conference at God knows what cost to finances and the environment. Trump appeared by video link and spent much of the time making bossy demands and threats, like a scene from The Apprentice. Once again, this is not TV. This is real life. His decisions affect us all. I’m someone who has lived with both poverty and wealth – but increasingly people from my working-class background will not be given the opportunities afforded to me. Because wealth is becoming more concentrated, cronyism is growing and the rest of the world is suffering. Some at least are calling it out. Last month, nearly 400 millionaires and billionaires signed a letter asking leaders at Davos to take action on extreme wealth – by taxing the super-rich, like them. And, in his farewell speech, the then US president, Joe Biden, warned of a dangerous oligarchy taking shape. This should be a wake-up call to us all – especially those people elected to represent us. Governments must address the obscene political capture we are witnessing. One simple way to do this is to tax the super-rich. These people now manage so much more than money. They manage what we read, what we watch, the information we’re given and, ultimately, how we vote. Last year, the EU Tax Observatory estimated that a 2% tax on billionaires could raise up to $250bn a year. About 3,000 people would pay it, and it would make very little difference to their lives. For everyone else, though, it would begin to rein in extreme wealth and fight back against the rising inequality that is damaging lives across the world. When a super-rich elite is determining the outcome of elections purely to protect their vested interests and accelerate profits, it’s clear that we are in a terrifying age of wealth extremism. Our leaders have lacked the backbone needed to rein in political capture and put ordinary people first. This cannot continue. It’s time for us to look closely at what’s happening, at how Trump is making a terrible situation even worse – and finally resolve to draw the line.

        "text": "For the third straight year, Forbes has scoured the nation to find the richest person in every state. We again found billionaires in all but three. The 54 entrepreneurs, investors and heirs on the 2025 ranking (including ties) are worth a record $2 trillion combined, up $400 billion since last year’s list. Five states have a new no. 1—all because one rich resident has overtaken another, rather than the high-profile, out-of-state moves that have shaken things up in past years. Among the states whose wealthiest person changed in 2025 is Missouri, where the richest Black American, IT mogul David Steward (estimated net worth: $11.4 billion) of St. Louis-based World Wide Technology, has surpassed John Morris ($9.6 billion) of Springfield-based Bass Pro Shops. Meanwhile, in neighboring Arkansas, Bentonville-based Walmart heir Rob Walton ($113 billion) takes the title from his brother Jim Walton ($112 billion). The world’s wealthiest woman, their sister Alice Walton ($104 billion), remains a distant second in Texas, behind the world’s wealthiest person, Elon Musk ($388 billion), who moved to the Lone Star State from California in 2020. Across the country in Washington, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer ($118 billion) beats out his old boss Bill Gates ($108 billion), after Forbes upped its estimate of the 2021 divorce settlement secured by Gates’ ex-wife Melinda French Gates ($30.2 billion). French Gates now ranks as the third richest person in the Evergreen State, one spot ahead of MacKenzie Scott ($26.7 billion), whose ex-husband Jeff Bezos ($206 billion) of Amazon has been Florida’s wealthiest resident since announcing his move from Washington to Miami in 2023. In Wisconsin, Diane Hendricks ($21.9 billion) is one of 10 women who are the richest residents of their respective states, up from nine last year. The Republican megadonor and cofounder of Beloit-based roofing giant ABC Supply, overtakes John Menard, Jr. ($21.5 billion), who founded the Eau Claire-based home improvement chain Menard’s. And then there’s New Jersey, where hedge fund tycoon John Overdeck ($7.4 billion) reclaims his state’s top spot from cable TV mogul Rocco Commisso ($5.8 billion), an Italian immigrant who moved with his family to New York City at age 12 in 1962. While at least one of America’s 868 billionaires can be found in almost every state, nearly two-thirds of them live in just four: California (194), New York (137), Florida (116) and Texas (81), where the competition for the top spot is particularly tough. That’s especially true in the Golden State, which is home to four of the seven richest Americans, including Oracle’s Larry Ellison ($175 billion) and Alphabet’s Larry Page ($135 billion) and Sergey Brin ($129 billion), who are all too poor to make this year’s list, given Palo Alto resident Mark Zuckerberg’s $189 billion fortune. In contrast, 10 states have just one billionaire: Alabama, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Vermont. Alaska, Delaware and West Virginia are still the only states without a billionaire, though Brad Smith, the retired CEO of Intuit and current president of Marshall University, is knocking on the door in the Mountain State, with an estimated $900 million net worth. Smith has been West Virginia’s richest person since the 2023 ranking, when he overtook the state’s former billionaire governor and current U.S. senator Jim Justice, who Forbes now estimates is broke and buried under more than $1 billion of debt and other liabilities.

        "text": "The nominees make up the richest presidential administration in modern history. President-elect Donald Trump has assembled the wealthiest presidential administration in modern history, with at least 13 billionaires set to take on government posts. They include a wrestling magnate, a private space pioneer, a New York real estate developer, the heir to a small appliance empire, and the wealthiest man on the planet -- with several being donors and close personal friends of the incoming president. In total, the combined net worth of the wealthiest members of his administration could surpass $460 billion, including Department of Government Efficiency co-head Elon Musk -- whose net worth of more than $400 billion exceeds the GDP of mid-sized countries. Even discounting Musk, Trump's cabinet is still expected to be the wealthiest in history, with reported billionaires Howard Lutnick nominated as commerce secretary, Linda McMahon nominated as education secretary, and Scott Bessent nominated as treasury secretary. Together, Trump's expected cabinet is worth at least $7 billion. Trump's ambassador picks also include several billionaires, including financier Warren Stephens, who has been tapped to serve as the ambassador to the United Kingdom, Conair executive Leandro Rizzuto Jr., tapped to serve as the ambassador to the Organization of American States, Charles Kushner, named the ambassador to France, and Tom Barrack, named the ambassador to Turkey. \"It's not a surprise that [Trump] surrounds himself with people who come from the same world that he does,\" said Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications for the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \"The billionaire class of businessmen is who he is and who he wants to be seen as, and who he wants to be seen with.\" The wealth of Trump's current cabinet rivals only that of his first-term cabinet -- which had a combined net worth of $3.2 billion -- and dwarfs the $118 million combined net worth of President Joe Biden's cabinet. During Trump's first term, his secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, boasted the highest net worth, with Forbes estimating it to be roughly $2 billion. In contrast, the wealthiest official in the Biden administration is White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, whose disclosures from 2021 showed his net worth ranging between $90 million and $443 million. While it's common for people with careers in business to serve in government, watchdog groups told ABC News that ultra-rich individuals with complex financial backgrounds and previous business dealings raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest. \"Being wealthy by itself is not a disqualifier,\" said Kedric Payne, senior director of Ethics at Campaign Legal Center, formerly deputy chief counsel of the Office of Congressional Ethics. \"It's just simply the potential conflicts of interest that are the concern.\" \"The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, and his Cabinet picks reflect his priority to put America First,\" Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told ABC News. \"President Trump will continue to appoint highly-qualified men and women who have the talent, experience, and necessary skill sets to Make America Great Again.\" Under federal ethics laws, Trump's wealthy nominees and appointees will have to divest themselves of stock holdings that could raise conflict issues, and will be required to release their financial disclosures. It's not yet clear if Musk and Ramaswamy will fall under the disclosure requirements, due to their DOGE positions being described as \"outside\" of the government -- despite the potentially massive impact they could have on the government. \"Luckily, there are laws in place that address this specific problem, and they're typically enforced,\" Payne said. The Office of Government Ethics will review presidential nominees and appointees' assets and financial interests before the Senate confirmation process, and provide advice on how to avoid conflicts of interests if they are confirmed, according to Payne. Here are the Trump administration's wealthiest members and how much they're reportedly worth. Musk is the world's richest person, with his stakes in Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter, and artificial intelligence startup xAI making him worth over $400 billion, according to Forbes. The tech mogul spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help return Trump to the White House, and has emerged as one of the most influential figures in Trump's orbit. Rizzuto's family made billions growing the hair product company Conair from a small family business run out of a Queens, New York, garage into one of the largest private companies in the United States. Forbes estimated the family's net worth at approximately $3.5 billion in 2017. Rizzuto briefly served as Trump's principal officer at the U.S. Consulate General in Bermuda in 2020 after his 2018 nomination to be ambassador to Barbados failed in the Senate. Stephens has spent his entire career with his family's Little Rock-based investment bank, becoming the firm's CEO and president in 1986. He spent $2 million in 2016 to support a group that aimed to stop Trump from winning the Republican nomination, but donated to Trump in the 2020 presidential race, and eventually supported Trump 2024 election after initially throwing his support behind other Republican candidates. McMahon, with her husband Vince McMahon, founded the company that later became World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. Under her leadership, WWE became the world's largest wrestling entertainment company, with Vince McMahon worth over $3 billion in 2024. The McMahons have since separated, and it's unclear how much of the company Linda owns individually. A Trump supporter, she was the head of the Small Business Administration during Trump's first term in office. Lutnick, who has been tapped to serve as the Secretary of the Department of Commerce, is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services firm he joined in 1983. The billionaire businessman has led the investment first since 1991 and owns about 60% of the company, according to Bloomberg. Kushner is a real estate developer who made his fortune building thousands of residential units across New Jersey. In 2005, Kushner was sentenced to 24 months in prison after pleading guilty to multiple felonies, including making false statements to the Federal Election Commission, assisting in the filing of a false tax return, and retaliating against a cooperation witness. During his plea hearing, he admitted to retaliating against his sister for cooperating with law enforcement by having a prostitute seduce her husband and covertly film them having sex. After serving his sentence, Kushner made a series of successful investments in the New York real estate market, including the purchase of a midtown skyscraper for nearly $2 billion. He was subsequently pardoned by Trump at the end of Trump's first term. His son Jared Kushner is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, and the Kushner family's overall net worth is approximately $1.8 billion according to Forbes. Isaacman is a pioneer in private space exploration who made his fortune by founding the payment processing company Shift4 Payments. In addition to his stake in Shift4 -- which processes a third of the customer payments made to American hotels and restaurants -- Issacman sold his tactical aircraft company Draken International, LLC, to the investment company Blackstone for a reported nine-figure sum. In 1991, Barrack founded the private equity real estate firm Colony Capital, which now manages more than $80 billion as DigitalBridge Group. A close friend of the president-elect, Barrack chaired Trump's first inaugural committee and in 2022 was acquitted of federal charges accusing him of illegal foreign lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates. After first meeting Donald Trump in a New York deli in the 1980s, Witkoff climbed New York's real estate ladder alongside Trump, ultimately building a personal fortune of a billion dollars. Witkoff has remained close to Trump for decades, testifying as an expert witness at his New York civil fraud trial in defense of the former president, and golfing with Trump during his second assassination attempt in September. Despite his limited experience in foreign affairs, Witkoff was named Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East. Bisiganano was one of JPMorgan Chase's most influential executives during the 2008 recession, before taking over the financial services company First Data Corporation. Bisiganano became the CEO of Fiserv -- a leading financial technology firm -- when the company bought First Data in 2019. A hefty executive compensation package -- more than $100 million in 2017 -- and his stake in the company contributed to his net worth exceeding $1 billion, according to Fortune. A protege of Democratic megadonor George Soros, Bessent worked as the chief investment officer of Soros Fund Management before founding his own firm, Key Square Group. Bessent developed a reputation for bold bets on macroeconomic trends, including making more than a billion dollars by betting against the British pound in the 1990s, followed by a similar trade against the Japanese yen in 2013 that netted more than a billion dollars in profits. At one point, Bessent's Key Square Group managed more than $5 billion. During the campaign cycle, Bessent was a major fundraiser and emerged as a key economic adviser to Trump. Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur and 2024 presidential candidate, made his fortune through his 10% stake in Roivant Sciences, a biotech company he founded in 2014. After leaving Roivant in 2021, he founded Strive Asset Management, which manages approximately $1.7 billion -- including offering an \"anti-woke\" index fund. During his long shot bid for the White House, Ramaswamy loaned and contributed $26 million to his own campaign. Sacks is a member of the so-called \"PayPal Mafia,\" a group of tech entrepreneurs who founded successful companies after eBay purchased PayPal in 2002. He launched a series of companies including the workplace communications company Yammer and the venture capital firm Craft Ventures. Sacks' podcast with fellow venture capitalists Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, and David Friedberg hosted Trump for a one-hour episode in June. As Trump's AI and crypto czar, Sacks is tasked with supercharging the development of AI and cryptocurrency development with minimal regulation. Loeffler is a former Georgia senator and the former CEO of Bakkt, a cryptocurrency trading platform. She owned a minority stake in the WNBA's Atlanta Dream in 2010 before selling her stake in 2021 amid criticism stemming from the Black Lives Matter movement. Loeffler is married to billionaire and major Trump donor Jeffrey Sprecher, the CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange. She was appointed to fill a vacated Senate seat in Georgia in 2020 but was defeated in a special election in 2021. Trump recently named Loeffler to serve as the co-chair of his inaugural committee and nominated her to lead the SBA. Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota, got his start in the software business in 1983 when he mortgaged a quarter million dollars worth of farmland to found Great Plains Software. Microsoft eventually purchased the company for a billion dollars in 2000, and Burgum went on to run a real estate development firm and venture capital company. He was elected governor of North Dakota in 2016 and was reelected in 2020. He ran a long shot presidential campaign and dropped out before the primaries, though he was one of Trump's final three picks for vice president. Dr. Oz is a heart surgeon-turned-TV-host who became famous for his program \"The Dr. Oz Show.\" He was previously the director of the Cardiovascular Institute at New York Presbyterian Hospital and vice-chairman and professor of surgery at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. In 2003, Oz began his television hosting career with his show \"Second Opinion\" on the Discovery Channel, and later became a regular on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" In 2009, Oz debuted his own \"Dr. Oz Show,\" which ran until 2022, when Oz ran for the Senate in Pennsylvania and lost. During the coronavirus pandemic, Oz promoted the treatment of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug unproven in treating COVID-19. He has faced criticism over his claims about weight-loss products and over his past statements on vaccination. Oz has defended his endorsement of controversial medical products by saying that he goes against the \"established grain,\" and that he always puts patients first. During his Senate run, he valued his assets between $100 million and $315 million, according to a federal financial disclosure. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

        "text": "Share surge increases Elon Musk’s fortune by $26bn in a day as Jeff Bezos, Sergey Brin and Bill Gates also benefit The wealth of the 10 richest people in the world – a list dominated by US tech billionaires – increased by a record amount after Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election, according to a widely cited index. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimated that the world’s 10 wealthiest people gained nearly $64bn (about £49.5bn) on Wednesday, the largest daily increase since the index began in 2012. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, registered the largest increase with a $26.5bn addition to his fortune, which now stands at $290bn. The prominent backer of Trump’s campaign, benefited from a surge in the share price of Tesla, the electric carmaker where he is chief executive and in which he owns a 13% stake. The gains came as tech business leaders, including Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook parent Meta, and Apple’s Tim Cook publicly congratulated Trump on his election win. Much of the gains for the top 10 was because of a surge in US stocks on Wednesday as investors anticipated a low-tax and regulation-light policy platform.

Other members of the top 10 whose wealth grew included Microsoft’s co-founder Bill Gates, the former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer, and Google’s co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. However, Trump has also expressed his frustration with Google on the campaign trail, after threatening in September to direct the justice department to pursue criminal charges against the search company if he won the election. He claimed that Google was displaying negative news articles about him but not about his opponent, Kamala Harris – a claim Google denied. The only member of the wealth elite to lose money on Wednesday was the French luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault, whose fortune decreased by nearly $3bn. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Zuckerberg’s wealth dipped slightly by $81m although he is still worth $202bn. The entrepreneur has drawn Trump’s ire, after the president-elect in August threatened to jail him for life for allegedly plotting against him in the 2020 election. Neil Wilson, chief analyst at the broker Finalto, said US stocks rose on Wednesday owing to a “pure Maga trade”, referring to Trump’s slogan “make America great again” and investors buying shares on the back of a clear Trump win. “It was the prospect of lower taxes, deregulation across a wider variety of sectors, such as banks and energy and tech, plus a big, reflexive relief rally on the fact that the outcome of the election was clean and uncontested,” he said. “The red-wave result was what every American capitalist would have favoured and was not a certainty by any means coming into the election, so the reaction was decisive.” Wealth increases from 5 November to 6 November 2024 \n 1. Elon Musk $290bn (+10.1%)\n 2. Jeff Bezos $228.3bn (+3.2%)\n 3. Mark Zuckerberg $202.5bn (0%)\n 4. Larry Ellison $193.5bn (+5.4%)\n 5. Bernard Arnault $173.2bn (-1.6%)\n 6.

        "title": "Here’s How Donald Trump's Net Worth Boomed In 2024",
        "domain": "forbes.com",
        "text": "ByStephen Pastis, Former Contributor. In one year, Donald Trump has gone from a net worth of $2.5 billion and facing significant legal burdens, to becoming President-elect and returning to Forbes’ tally of America’s richest people, thanks to his majority stake in Truth Social’s parent company, which grew his net worth to $6.1 billion.  January 2024By early this year, Trump’s net worth stood around $2.5 billion, a figure Forbes determined in September 2023 for the annual Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans; that figure declined from his previous time in office, when his net worth reached $4 billion—although his net worth was less volatile before he gained ownership of a public company.  March 26, 2024Trump’s net worth rose rapidly to $6.4 billion within a day of Truth Social’s parent company going public—jumping from $2.3 billion after his legal judgments weighed down his net worth between January and March. His net worth fell from $2.5 billion after his legal burdens weighed down his net worth between January and March. Shares—listed with the ticker DJT—popped after the reverse merger closed between the special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp and Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), which was approved after months of delays.  March 27, 2024Within two days of being publicly traded, Trump touched a $7 billion net worth as excitement about the company continued.  April 16, 2024Trump’s net worth, at $3.67 billion, reached one of the year’s lowest points on April 16, as TMTG share price hit bottom following a drop lasting several days, but the stock began rising by the month’s end, pushing Trump’s net worth to $7.6 billion on Apr. 30 as he expanded his stake. May 09, 2024For the second time in one year, Trump’s net worth doubled in value to more than $8.1 billion, the highest of all time, with his net worth remaining above $5 billion throughout the month and reaching $8 billion again on the 14th. Coincidentally, on the same day, a jury found Trump had abused Elle magazine writer E. Jean Carroll and granted her $5 million in damages. Days prior, adult film star Stormy Daniels testified in a hush money trial against Trump that he was later convicted in. May 31, 2024Trump’s net worth dropped about $300 million to $7.5 billion the day after a jury decided he was guilty of all 34 felony charges from falsifying business records in his criminal hush money trial that dates back to 2023.   July 15, 2024An assassination attempt against Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 14 was followed by a surge in TMTG, boosting his net worth by more than $1 billion to $6.1 billion.  September 13, 2024Trump announced he wouldn’t sell his shares in TMTG as a lockup period that prevented him from selling was nearing expiration. His net worth rose by about $200 million to $3.9 billion as he told reporters, “I’m not selling. No, I love it.” The rebound came days after his net worth dropped following his debate performance against Vice President Kamala Harris, and shares remained depressed throughout the month, reaching some of the lowest points of the year.  October 1, 2024In a turn of fate for the 78-year-old billionaire, Trump’s months of holding TMTG placed him back on the 2024 Forbes 400 list, where he ranked 319th with a net worth of $4.3 billion after he was dropped from the list in 2021 for the first time in 25 years.   October 29, 2024In the most significant spike of the year, Trump’s net worth peaked for the third time at $8 billion after several weeks of TMTG rallying as the betting odds of a Trump election victory grew.  November 6, 2024Trump’s election victory sent his net worth to $6.2 billion the day after his win was called and his net worth remained consistently around $5.1 billion and higher throughout the month.  December 6, 2024As Trump spent his first month as President-elect focused on the transition, his net worth grew to $6 billion by Dec. 9th and remained there or above—reaching $6.51 billion on Dec. 16th and slightly shifting on Dec. 20 as he transferred his entire stake to a trust.  Trump’s portfolio of assets on Dec. 23 was worth $6.1 billion, making him the 530th richest person in the world. His wealth is largely tied to the value of TMTG. His 60% stake in the fluctuating stock makes him the largest shareholder, and it makes up more than half of his net worth. He also owns about $1.1 billion worth of skyscrapers, penthouses, buildings, homes, hotels and golf courses worldwide. Additionally, he owns a licensing business and sells various products, like Trump-themed NFTs, sneakers, Chinese-manufactured bibles, guitars, cologne and watches. ",

        "title": "The Great Wealth Transfer is on hold, says Charles Schwab",
        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "Preston Fore is a reporter on Fortune's Success team. Baby Boomers are trying to figure out what to do with their wealth: Give it to their kids now, or wait until they pass on.  It’s a nice problem to have, surely, but when it concerns the $80 trillion Great Wealth Transfer the indecision could have major ramifications for both heirs and the rest of the U.S. economy. One study found that for many Boomers, the question has already been decided: Hurry up and wait, kids.\n\n\n\n \n Nearly half of high-net-worth Baby Boomers—people between the ages of 60 and 79 with more than $1 million in investable assets—say they plan to hold onto their wealth during their lifetime, according to a recent survey from Charles Schwab. Between rising healthcare costs and living longer, Boomer respondents say they plan to hold onto their wealth for longer.\n\n\n\n That’s in stark contrast to the nearly 97% of Gen Xers and Millennials who say they will share their wealth while they’re still alive.  \n One reason for Boomers’ view on their wealth has to do with innovative financial advice, says Susan Hirshman, director of wealth management for Schwab Wealth Advisory and Schwab Center for Financial Research. With an emphasis on goal-based financial planning, she says, young generations know if they will have a wealth surplus—and then can consider what to do with it earlier.\n\n\n\n “A financial plan is a living, breathing tool,” Hirshamn says. “It needs to be evaluated on a consistent basis, and as life changes, your plan may have to change and adapt to those changing needs.”\n\n\n\n Younger generations stand to benefit the most from the Great Wealth Transfer, but the latest Schwab High Net Worth Investor Survey indicates that high-net-worth Millennials and Gen Xers are more than twice as likely to share their wealth with the next generation during their lifetime as compared to Boomers.\n\n\n\n This could be tied to the fact that younger generations are more cognizant of the wealth disparities in the U.S. and around the world. At age 35, the wealthiest millennials tend to have more money than their baby boomer counterparts, and the poorest have less, according to a study from the American Journal of Sociology.\n\n\n\n The total billionaire wealth increased by $2 trillion in 2024 alone—and each billionaire’s wealth grew about $2 million per day on average, according to Oxfam. The year also brought 204 newly minted billionaires, equating to about four new per week. In the next decade, the organization predicts there will be five trillionaires. \n Even members of the ultra-rich agree that wealth issues are out of hand. Bill Gates, one of the wealthiest individuals on Earth, called for increased taxes on the rich—so far as to say he would support a tax that would reduce his wealth by over $100 billion. Gates, along with dozens of other ultra-rich individuals, pledged to donate a majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\n\n\n Schwab’s data suggests that the Great Wealth Transfer will go slower than anticipated, but most wealthy Americans believe that sharing some wealth while they are alive is important so they can financially support their families, share in their joy, and make memories together. \n\n\n\n However, a majority are planning to only distribute about 40% of their assets while living—leaving the rest to pass on after their passing. Only about a quarter of Americans with children have had discussions about generational wealth, and even those who do, communication is often limited and inconclusive, according to research from Edward Jones.\n\n\n\n Hirshman says being open about estate planning sooner rather than later will lead to less headache for families during a time that should be dedicated to grieving and remembrance.\n\n\n\n “By having those conversations early, explaining what's going to happen, who to call, where the documents are, right, what the resources are, what the plan is, how we thought about everything,” says Hirshman. “It allows for calmer, controlled execution of the estate plan.” \n The good news is that the younger generations are already listening. Sixty-three percent of wealthy individuals are starting to plan before they turn 45 years old. To transfer wealth appropriately, Hirshman says, it starts with playing the ‘what if’ game. Before over-transferring, one should consider questions like: What if your healthcare costs are extreme? What if you live to 100?\n\n\n\n Above all, she encourages individuals to engage in effective communication, consistent reviews of financial plans—both in terms of taxes and family dynamics—and honest conversations about responsibilities. For example, who is the executor or trustee, or does outside help need to be brought in?\n\n\n\n Younger generations also plan to attach more strings to their wealth. While 97% of millennials plan to have some kind of stipulation to their money transfer, only 34% of Boomers care. Overall, Hirshman says conversations about wealth transfer are not about only keeping or only giving—it’s about doing both, responsibly.\n  © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

        "title": "Trump assembling US cabinet of billionaires worth combined $340bn",
        "domain": "theguardian.com",
        "text": "President-elect tapping mega-rich backers for positions that will give them power to cut spending on public services Enough billionaires and multimillionaires have been assembled by Donald Trump to fill key roles in his nascent administration to form a soccer team. In a recruitment process that appears to mock his campaign’s appeal to working-class voters, the president-elect has brazenly tapped a gallery of mega-rich backers for key positions that, in some instances, will give them power to cut spending on public services that are used by the most poor and vulnerable. At least 11 picks for strategic positions after Trump returns to the White House in January have either achieved billionaire status themselves, have billionaire spouses or are within touching distance of that threshold. The net result will be the wealthiest administration in US history – worth a total of $340bn at the start of this week, before Trump further boosted its monetary value by trying to appoint at least three more billionaires. Its collective wealth easily outstrips that of Trump’s first cabinet, formed after his 2016 election victory – which at the time was the richest US cabinet ever formed, containing such super-rich members as Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of ExxonMobil, who was appointed secretary of state, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, who had become wealthy through restructuring bankrupt companies. It also throws into stark relief the relative impoverishment of the current cabinet of Joe Biden – collectively worth a relatively paltry $118m despite having been repeatedly derided by Trump as representative of a corrupt governing elite that was cheating ordinary working Americans. The wealthiest – and most prominent – of Trump’s 2024 class is Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur who is the world’s richest man. Along with Vivek Ramaswamy, another tech entrepreneur who is said to be worth at least $1bn, Musk has been tapped to spearhead a newly created department of government efficiency, already known by its acronym Doge, whose mission is to cut waste from public spending. The conspicuously extravagant Musk has pledged to cut $2tn from the national budget. He has not explained how or over what period, although he has warned that it may entail “temporary economic hardships”. Neither Musk nor Ramaswamy will need Senate confirmation, since Doge is not an official government department or agency. However, Trump has not shied away from nominating billionaire cabinet members who will have to undergo public Senate hearings at which their wealth may become an issue. These include Linda McMahon, the nominee for education secretary – and a former World Wrestling Entertainment executive – whose husband, Vince McMahon, is worth an estimated $3bn; the North Dakota governor and former businessman Doug Burgum, designated to be secretary of the interior; Howard Lutnick, the chair and chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, who has been nominated as commerce secretary; and Scott Bessent, a hedge-fund manager and former partner at Soros Investment Management, who has been nominated as treasury secretary. Their collective worth alone amounts to $10.7bn – $4.5bn more than Trump’s first cabinet. Others subject to Senate confirmation are Charles Kushner – a property tycoon and father of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner – the prospective ambassador to Paris; Warren Stephens, head of an investment bank and chosen as ambassador to London; Jared Isaacman, a commercial astronaut and entrepreneur who has been nominated to head the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa); and Kelly Loeffler, a former GOP senator and joint head of Trump’s inaugural committee, now his choice to head the Small Business Administration. All fall under the billionaire bracket either individually or through marital or family links, according to Forbes. So, too, does Steve Witkoff, another property tycoon and golfing partner of Trump, who has chosen him as his Middle East envoy. Witkoff’s net worth has been estimated at $1bn. Then there is Frank Bisignano, nominated as head of the Social Security Administration, where he would be responsible for managing the pensions and benefits of the country’s retirees. The president of Fiserv Inc, a Wisconsin-based financial technology firm, his current wealth is estimated at around $974m. The president-elect has reportedly offered the deputy defence secretary slot to yet another billionaire, Stephen Feinberg, a private equity investor and co-chair of Cerberus Capital Management, whose personal worth as of July this year was assessed at $4.8bn. It is not known whether Feinberg has accepted. The gulf between Trump’s taste for the wealthy and his populist everyman rhetoric has not gone unnoticed. Analysts have long noted the ability of a politician who proudly flaunts his own self-proclaimed billionaire status to tap into popular resentment over stagnating incomes and living standards – accentuated by his laments over the loss of industrial jobs and trade deals that he says have harmed American workers. “According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, working-class Americans’ real wages have stagnated or declined since the early 1980s, especially as industries moved jobs overseas,” wrote Matthew King, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund, in a blog post. “This may help explain Trump’s working class appeal.” Trump, King argued, could exploit working-class anxieties because he “knew that pride in God, family, and country would resonate in a way that the progressive messages of other candidates didn’t”. David Kass, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, said the goal of what he called Trump’s “government by the billionaires for the billionaires” was huge tax cuts for the super-rich, which would be achieved at the cost of slashing services such as education, social security and Medicaid, which provides healthcare for those with lower incomes. “Voters wanted a change,” Kass said. “I think what’s going to happen is that people will say, that’s not actually what I wanted. The rich are rich enough and don’t need more tax cuts. How about helping me? I think there’s going to be a huge mobilisation against this [tax cut].” But King warned that Trump’s emotional resonance may override envy of the rich. “I still believe that Trump’s working-class appeal will continue to enable him to exploit the working class successfully while funnelling the rewards to the new oligarchy: big businesses and billionaires like Elon Musk,” he wrote.",

        "text": "Published Dec 05, 2024 at 10:43 AM EST updated Dec 05, 2024 at 06:13 PM EST US News Reporter The collective net worth of America's richest 12 men has hit $2 trillion, less than $2 trillion short of the wealth of the bottom half of the U.S. An analysis by Forbes showed that as of December 3, America's top billionaires, including Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, accumulated a collective net worth of more than $2 trillion. This sum is only $1.8 trillion off the total net worth of the nation's bottom 50 percent, which, as of the second quartile of this year, hit $3.82 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis data, showing the extent of the economic inequality in the U.S. Commenting on whether the issue of wealth inequality will worsen in the coming years, Boston University Assistant Professor Krishna Dasaratha told Newsweek, \"The incoming administration campaigned on or is considering a number of policies that would exacerbate wealth inequality, including further corporate tax cuts and rolling back antitrust enforcement and protections for workers.\" Newsweek has contacted the administration of President-elect Donald Trump out of hours via email for comment. The 12 most wealthy Americans have changed over the years, and this month's newcomer is Jensen Huang, the co-founder and CEO of the technology company Nvidia. In 2020, his wealth was $4.7 billion, but after a whopping 2,504 percent increase in his net worth, he now has $122.4 trillion, situating him as the ninth wealthiest American, according to Forbes data. His wealth is directly tied to the rising market for artificial intelligence, as his company produces the computer chips used by AI systems. Nvidia is gaining so much economic momentum that Forbes reported Huang might have been the world's first trillionaire if he had increased his ownership of the company, which is currently 3.5 percent, to 40 percent. Musk has also seen a massive boost in his net worth over the last four years, an increase of 1,256 percent, which has made him America's richest man. Musk's wealth is primarily tied to Tesla, of which he owns a 12 percent stake, and, more recently, SpaceX, of which he holds a 42 percent stake. As of the second half of this year, SpaceX was worth $210 billion. Musk also founded the startup xAI in 2023, now worth around $50 billion, of which he owns around 54 percent. Purchasing the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, in 2022 did not boost his wealth as his other ventures have, for the platform is now worth 70 percent less compared to when he bought it, Forbes reported. The fact that 12 American men collectively hold $1.8 trillion less than the country's bottom 50 percent highlights the issue of economic inequality in the U.S. Former Secretary of Labor Richard Reich, who served during the Clinton administration, commented on the update on X, writing, \"Wealth inequality is eating this country alive.\" There are hundreds of billionaires in America, most of whom live in California, even though the state's median household income is not the wealthiest and instead ranked fifth. Analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that in recent years, the wealth gap in the U.S. has been continuing to expand, and in 2022, the bottom 50 percent of Americans held 2 percent of the country's wealth. Meanwhile, the top 10 percent of families owned 74 percent of the country's wealth. Update 12/06/24, 02:50 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with comment from Krishna Dasaratha.

        "title": "Forget quiet luxury: America’s wealthy 1% are adopting a bolder new approach",
        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "Billionaires and wealthy consumers are going bold—from opting for loud fashion choices, to making flashy public appearances. It’s a far cry from the popular “quiet luxury” trend of muted colors and nonexistent logos that’s dominated for years in an attempt to hide wealth and power.  At this year’s New York Fashion Week events, attendees were starting to break from the mold of quiet luxury. The looks weren’t exclusively understated—bolder prints, luxe fabrics, and even fur pieces were spotted on and off the runway from top designers such as Michael Kors, Coach, and Carolina Herrera. This change in consumer tastes reflect a growing hunger for individuality. “There are two tracks in this luxury trend: There’s a quiet version, there’s a loud version,” Chandler Mount, founder of Affluent Consumer Research Company, told Fortune. America’s billionaires and corporate elite are getting bolder, which could be empowering the luxury shopping class to do the same. CEOs are stepping out of the shadows and into the limelight—a prime example being this year’s presidential inauguration, attended by tech leaders Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Tim Cook. It’s unusual for titans of industry to attend the event, let alone be seated in front of the incoming president’s chief staffers. Jeff Bezos’ wife Lauren Sánchez also made a splash by wearing a daring white bralette peeping from her low-cut pantsuit.  CEOs once lead without drawing too much attention to themselves for the sake of their companies, but that is no longer the case. Billionaires are getting bolder, mirroring wealthy society’s growing desire for individuality and expression—especially in fashion. Sturdy, hand-dyed cotton shirts and satin skirts can get boring, just like making big business moves in the background. Billionaires are no longer as inconspicuous as they once were. Tech CEOs have become entertaining personalities that the public tunes into each week. The likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk all rose to prominence as unassuming, hoodie-wearing tech-bros. Now, they’ve leaned into high-flying, leather jacket-wearing, public-facing personas.  Zuckerberg has hosted livestreams to chat with online users, is lobbying at the U.S. capitol, and trailed behind an MMA fighter walking into the sports area. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos lounges on his $500 million megayacht, fielded the public questions for who should star in his studio’s upcoming movie, and is photographed donning edgier looks alongside his manicured wife. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is no exception to the trend. He towered above President Donald Trump giving press briefings in the White House, wielded a chainsaw at a conservative conference, and went onstage at Dave Chappelle’s comedy show.  This behavior is a far cry from the likes of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Both tech leaders were billionaires and pioneers of industry, but didn’t radiate an energy of grandeur. They didn’t make grandiose public appearances, or tried to spur attention towards themselves. Oftentimes, the CEOs only stepped into the spotlight to promote and demo their products: like the iPhone, or Microsoft Windows software. They certainly weren’t being loud—and didn’t seem to crave that. But a shift has taken place in corporate America and amongst the country’s 1%. Wealthy individuals are turning to bold expression. This trend is reflected in ways rich people are expressing status—and themselves.   Mirroring the attitudes of forward-facing billionaires, more people are moving away from inconspicuous styling to loud expression.  “The time has come, and the next generation of luxury consumers is here. That 18 to 34-year-old consumer group is constantly redefining luxury, because they are the primary buyers of it,” Mount said. “They’re looking for more expression in what they’re wearing. They want people to learn something about them by what they wear.” Quiet luxury initially rose as a style staple when many consumers were disillusioned with flashy branding and fast fashion—and it became the new “stealth” signifier of wealth. But the tables may have turned again, and people want to stand out; at this year’s New York Fashion week, fashion photographer and writer Simbarashe Cha noticed a turn in the tides of quiet luxury.  Read more from Fortune   Cha noted that show-goers and models were rocking new trends: an abundance of fur coats, animal prints, exaggerated silhouettes, and layered textures. The looks were subversive to the navy and all-black styles people were donning just a couple years before. Cha said that fashion is turning loud again—and certainly, some boundaries are being broken. John Rogers, a U.S. fashion designer who has styled the likes of Zendaya and Gigi Hadid, has also witnessed the shift. His clothing combines that quiet luxury timelessness and quality with rich color and patterns. Behind the scenes of his New York Fashion Week show this year, he spoke withBBC about divergence from the plainness of quiet luxury.  “We want newness; we want transformation,” Rogers said. “But we have to be willing to try some fresh approaches. We have to make people excited to get dressed again, to use clothes as a tool for hope… Even if you’re just wearing them to go down the street for coffee.” Emma Burleigh is a reporter at Fortune, covering success, careers, entrepreneurship, and personal finance.

        "text": "How to be a billionaire and pay no taxes Listen to more stories on the  Noa app. This is Work in Progress, a newsletter about work, technology, and how to solve some of America’s biggest problems. Sign up here. America’s superrich have always found ways to avoid paying taxes, but in recent years, they’ve discovered what might be the mother of all loopholes. It’s a three-step process called “Buy, Borrow, Die,” and it allows people to amass a huge fortune, spend as much of it as they want, and pass the rest—untaxed—on to their heirs. The technique is so cleverly designed that the standard wish list of progressive tax reforms would leave it completely intact. Step one: buy. The average American derives most of their disposable income from the wages they earn working a job, but the superrich are different. They amass their fortune by buying and owning assets that appreciate. Elon Musk hasn’t taken a traditional salary as CEO of Tesla since 2019; Warren Buffett, the chair of Berkshire Hathaway, has famously kept his salary at $100,000 for more than 40 years. Their wealth consists almost entirely of stock in the companies they’ve built or invested in. The tax-law scholars Edward Fox and Zachary Liscow found that even when you exclude the 400 wealthiest individuals in America, the remaining members of the top 1 percent hold $23 trillion in assets. Unlike wages, which are taxed the moment they are earned, assets are taxed only at the moment they are sold—or, in tax terms, “realized.” The justification for this approach is that unrealized assets exist only on paper; you can’t pay for a private jet or buy a company with stocks, even if they have appreciated by billions of dollars. In theory, the rich will eventually need to sell their assets for cash, at which point they will pay taxes on their increase in wealth. That theory would be much closer to reality if not for step two: borrow. Instead of selling their assets to make major purchases, the superrich can use them as collateral to secure loans, which, because they must eventually be repaid, are also not considered taxable income. Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle and America’s fourth-richest person, has pledged more than $30 billion of his company’s stock as collateral in order to fund his lavish lifestyle, which includes building a $270 million yacht, buying a $300 million island, and purchasing an $80 million mansion. A Forbes analysis found that, as of April 2022, Musk had pledged Tesla shares worth more than $94 billion, which “serve as an evergreen credit facility, giving Musk access to cash when he needs it.” This strategy isn’t as common among the merely very rich, who may not have the expensive tastes that Ellison and Musk do, but it isn’t rare either. Liscow and Fox calculated that the top 1 percent of wealth-holders, excluding the richest 400 Americans, borrowed more than $1 trillion in 2022. And the approach appears to be gaining momentum. Last year, The Economist reported that, at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America alone, the value of “securities-backed loans” increased from $80 billion in 2018 to almost $150 billion in 2022. “The real question is: Why would you not borrow hundreds of millions, even billions, to fund the lifestyle you want to live?” Tom Anderson, a wealth-management consultant and former banker who specializes in these loans, told me. “This is such an easy tool to use. And the tax benefits are massive.” Annie Lowrey: Trump says his tax plan won’t benefit the rich—he’s exactly wrong You might think this couldn’t possibly go on forever. Eventually, the rich will need to sell off some of their assets to pay back the loan. That brings us to step three: die. According to a provision of the tax code known as “stepped-up basis”—or, more evocatively, the “angel of death” loophole—when an individual dies, the value that their assets gained during their lifetime becomes immune to taxation. Those assets can then be sold by the billionaire’s heirs to pay off any outstanding loans without them having to worry about taxes. The justification for the stepped-up-basis rule is that the United States already levies a 40 percent inheritance tax on fortunes larger than $14 million, and it would be unfair to tax assets twice. In practice, however, a seemingly infinite number of loopholes allow the rich to avoid paying this tax, many of which involve placing assets in byzantine legal trusts that enable them to be passed seamlessly from one generation to the next. “Only morons pay the estate tax,” Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive and the then–chief economic adviser to Donald Trump, memorably remarked in 2017. “All of this is completely, perfectly legal,” Edward McCaffery, the scholar who coined the term Buy, Borrow, Die, told me. But, he said, the strategy “has basically killed the entire concept of an income tax for the wealthiest individuals.” The tax economist Daniel Reck, who has spent his career documenting the various ways the rich evade taxation, told me that Buy, Borrow, Die is “the most important tax-avoidance strategy today.” The result is a two-tiered tax system: one for the many, who earn their income through wages and pay taxes, and another for the few, who accumulate wealth through paper assets and largely do not pay taxes. Much of the debate around American tax policy focuses on the income-tax rate paid by the very wealthiest Americans. But the bulk of those people’s fortunes doesn’t qualify as income in the first place. A 2021 ProPublica investigation of the private tax records of America’s 25 richest individuals found that they collectively paid an effective tax rate of just 3.4 percent on their total wealth gain from 2014 to 2018. Musk paid 3.3 percent, Jeff Bezos 1 percent, and Buffett—who has famously argued for imposing higher income-tax rates on the superrich—just 0.1 percent. The same dynamic exists, in slightly less egregious form, further down the wealth distribution. A 2021 White House study found that the 400 richest American households paid an effective tax rate of 8.2 percent on their total wealth gains from 2010 to 2018. Liscow and Fox found that, excluding the top 400, the rest of the 0.1 percent richest individuals paid an effective rate of 12 percent from 2004 to 2022. (Twelve percent is the income-tax rate paid by individuals who make $11,601 to $47,150 a year.) One solution to this basic unfairness would be to tax unrealized assets. In 2022, the Biden administration proposed a “billionaire minimum tax” that would have placed a new annual levy of up to 20 percent on the appreciation of even unsold assets for households with more than $100 million in wealth. Experts have vehemently debated the substantive merits of such a policy; the real problem, however, is political. According to a survey conducted by Liscow and Fox, most Americans oppose a tax on unrealized gains even when applied only to the richest individuals. The Joe Biden proposal, perhaps unsurprisingly, went nowhere in Congress. Making matters more complicated, even if such a policy did pass, the Supreme Court would very likely rule it unconstitutional. James Kwak: The tax code for the ultra-rich vs. the one for everyone else A second idea would be to address the “borrow” step. Last year, Liscow and Fox published a proposal to tax the borrowing of households worth more than $100 million, which they estimated would raise about $10 billion a year. The limitation of that solution, as the authors acknowledge, is that it would not address the larger pool of rich Americans who don’t borrow heavily against their assets but do take advantage of stepped-up basis. That leaves the “die” step. Tax experts from across the political spectrum generally support eliminating the “stepped-up basis” rule, allowing unrealized assets to be taxed at death. This would be far more politically palatable than the dead-on-arrival billionaire’s minimum tax: In the same survey in which respondents overwhelmingly opposed broad taxes on unrealized assets during life, Liscow and Fox also found that nearly two-thirds of them supported taxing unrealized assets at death. Even a change this widely supported, however, would run up against the iron law of democratic politics: Policies with concentrated benefits and distributed costs are very hard to overturn. That’s especially true when the benefits just so happen to be concentrated among the richest, most powerful people in the country. In fact, the Biden administration did propose eliminating stepped-up basis as part of its Build Back Better legislation. The move prompted an intense backlash from special-interest groups and their allied politicians, with opponents portraying the provision as an assault on rural America that would destroy family farms and businesses. These claims were completely unfounded—the bill had specific exemptions for family businesses and applied only to assets greater than $2.5 million—but the effort succeeded at riling up enough Democratic opposition to kill the idea. The one guarantee of any tax regime is that, eventually, the rich and powerful will learn how to game it. In theory, a democratic system, operating on behalf of the majority, should be able to respond by making adjustments that force the rich to pay their fair share. But in a world where money readily translates to political power, voice, and influence, the superrich have virtually endless resources at their disposal to make sure that doesn’t happen. To make society more equal, you need to tax the rich. But to tax the rich, it helps for society to be more equal. TheAtlantic.com © 2025 The Atlantic Monthly Group. All Rights Reserved.

        "text": "The gender wealth gap among America’s richest people remains wide—there are only 67 women on this year’s Forbes 400 list—but it’s narrowing. Women now account for 17% of the list, up from 15% last year, and they hold 15% of the 400’s total wealth, up from 14% in 2023. As always, progress remains slow and steady. In all, these 67 women are worth a combined $839 billion, up from the $621 billion that the 60 women on last year’s list held. Making it onto the Forbes 400 list this year required a minimum net worth of $3.3 billion–the highest cutoff to date. Alice Walton is once again the richest American woman of all, a title she has held for nine out of the past ten years. The vast majority of her estimated $89.2 billion fortune comes from a stake in Walmart, the retail giant cofounded by her father, Sam Walton (d. 1992). Walmart stock is up 47% since last year, boosting Walton to the 15th richest person in America. (In early September she briefly reclaimed the title of wealthiest woman in the world from L’Oreal’s Francoise Bettencourt Meyers of France as well.) Like Walton, the majority of the women on The Forbes 400—54 in all—inherited their wealth. Less than 20% are self made, compared to 76% of the men on the ranking. The wealthiest self-made American woman remains Diane Hendricks, who cofounded building materials distributor ABC Supply in 1982 and boasts an estimated net worth of $21.9 billion. Other notable self-made women include medical records software firm Epic Systems’ founder Judy Faulkner ($7.7 billion) and Meg Whitman ($3.6 billion), the former CEO of eBay and Hewlett-Packard, and current U.S. ambassador to Kenya.  One big gainer: Melinda French Gates. Forbes pegs her fortune at $29 billion this year, nearly triple our $10.3 billion estimate a year ago. The increase came as the result of Forbes’ higher estimate of French Gates’ 2021 divorce settlement with Bill Gates. A spokesperson for French Gates had no comment on her net worth. Five women made the list for the first time this year, including Lyndal Stephens Greth, who joins after inheriting the $32.3 billion family fortune built by her father, oil tycoon Autry Stephens, who died in August. Arista Networks CEO Jayshree Ullal is the only self-made female newcomer, after shares of the computer networking company climbed more than 80% since last year’s list, pushing her estimated net worth to $4.4 billion. This year’s richest American women hail from 13 different industries. The most common is food & beverage, source of 22% of female listees’ fortunes, including Chick-fil-A heiress Trudy Cathy White ($10.6 billion) and Panda Express cofounder Peggy Cherng ($3.7 billion). The second and third most-represented industries among the list’s women are technology (13%) and fashion & retail (10%).",

        "text": "“California used to be the Golden State. Now it’s rusted and destroyed,” says energy drinks magnate Russ Weiner. In a way, the state’s flush with gold; California is a treasure trove of extreme wealth. But some of its most affluent residents, including Weiner (worth an estimated $4.8 billion as of the date of publishing), have also been moving away, Forbes finds in a 20-year analysis of the annual Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. California has consistently been home to more members of The Forbes 400 than any other state, and now has 87. But that’s six fewer than two decades ago. Plenty of California-based tech tycoons moved on and off the list over the years as their fortunes fluctuated with the stock market, but some disappeared because billionaires just up and left. Over the past 20 years, while gaining new Forbes 400 residents, California lost 19 of them to other states, particularly Texas, Nevada and Florida, where Rockstar Energy drink founder Weiner moved in 2009. What made him want to skip town? “Crime, homelessness, education, taxes,” he says. Oh, and Democrats.  Weiner is far from the only uber-wealthy entrepreneur who’s been chasing both rays and lower taxes. Florida and Texas, which have neither state income tax nor state capital gains tax, both saw dramatic 20-year upticks in residents who made the 400 list. Texas went from 36 to 45, a 25% jump, while Florida — stunningly — doubled from 23 to 46 members of the list. Most of the increase in Florida came from Forbes 400 members moving there. That includes the likes of hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin, a former longtime resident of Chicago, who also relocated his firm Citadel to Miami because he said it offered a better corporate environment; Paychex founder Tom Golisano, who said he was escaping New York’s high taxes when he moved to Naples in 2009; Charles B. Johnson, who moved to Palm Beach from California after retiring from money management firm Franklin Resources; and Thomas Peterffy of Interactive Brokers, who left Connecticut around 2015, also for Palm Beach. An outsized number of the last decade’s Florida transplants came from the northeastern elite enclaves of New York, Connecticut and Illinois, and most made their fortunes in finance and investments. A far smaller amount of the list’s new Floridians created fortunes in the Sunshine State from the start, like Nick Caporella, whose National Beverage makes the popular La Croix bubbly water. The picture is much dimmer in the Midwest, which has been shedding the extremely wealthy. The number of richest Americans there dropped 42% over the past two decades, from 73 to 42, mostly because Heartland billionaires’ fortunes decreased or didn’t keep pace with the rest of the country. (The cutoff to make the Forbes 400 rose from $600 million in 2003 to $2.9 billion in 2023.) But some just moved to warmer pastures, like movie producer Gigi Pritzker (who changed her permanent address from Chicago to California around 2019) or two heirs to the Walmart fortune (from Missouri to Texas and Nevada). And about 30% of Midwesterners on the 2003 and 2013 Forbes 400 lists have since dropped off because they passed away. In the last few years, that’s included iconic figures like Berkshire Hathaway’s Walter Scott Jr. (a former Omaha resident who was a close friend of Warren Buffett) and Chicago’s Sam Zell (forefather of the modern real estate investment trust), and a bit before them, William Ford Sr, the last grandchild of Henry Ford, who lived in Michigan. The manufacturing industry saw a particularly high number of drop-offs — paralleling the decades-long manufacturing decline in the Midwest — as did media, real estate and retail. Minnesota has been hit hardest. It ranked No. 9 among states with the most 400 members in 2003, when there were 11, but has now been completely drained out. A single family had an outsized impact on that decline. The clan behind the world’s biggest agriculture company, Cargill, used to be concentrated in the North Star State, where the business is still based. But Cargill’s old guard has died and the richest family members are now scattered across the country in Montana, Wisconsin, Missouri and California. This scenario — where a company’s big shareholders live far from the company itself — is actually not unusual. And it may be even more common these days in a place like Minnesota, says the Tax Foundation’s Jared Walczak. “Minnesota does very well with traditional C corporations,” says Walczak. “It’s high taxes, but those high taxes historically have not fallen very heavily on businesses, so it's been a very competitive place to operate your Fortune 500 company. But you also have a situation where states like this may be unattractive for the C-suites themselves,” perhaps in part because of those higher individual taxes. And in an increasingly mobile environment, he points out, not even high-level executives need to live where they work. Although taxes matter, Walczak and other analysts stress that it’s far from the only consideration for billionaires when it comes to planning where to live. It often isn’t even the top factor. “Many state lawmakers overestimate how sensitive rich people are to a few percentage points’ difference in the state tax rate,” says Carl Davis of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Richard Auxier of the Tax Policy Center agrees: “If you’re in West Virginia or Michigan and you think the taxes are the only thing that’s different about your state and Florida and Texas, I really need you to think a bit harder.”  Instead, the decision of where to live is hyper-personal, they say, noting that being closer to family is a frequent reason why billionaires move. The uber-wealthy also pursue top education systems, keeping in mind both their kids as well as their company workforces. Urban amenities are a big draw. So are safe neighborhoods, good infrastructure and centers of culture. The culture is what AriZona Iced Tea founder Don Vultaggio, raised in Brooklyn and worth an estimated $5.6 billion, loves about New York City. (Vultaggio now lives outside the city, in the Long Island enclave of Port Washington.) He remembers a conversation he once had with Andrew Cuomo: “‘Governor, businesses don’t mind paying taxes. We like it here. Museums, theater. It’s great.’” Many must agree, as the number of New Yorkers on the 400 shot up 27% over the past two decades, from 49 to 62. Extreme wealth has been consolidating in the United States. Back in 2003, the 10 states with the most 400 members had 275 of them; today, they have 297. Exactly 60% of the billionaires who made the list this year live in just four states: California, New York, Florida and Texas — the four states with the largest populations, together home to one third of all Americans. “The growing geographic concentration helps explain our populist politics these days,” says Darrell West, author of the 2014 book Billionaires: Reflections on the Upper Crust. “Much of the country is being left behind in terms of economic activity.” A handful of states — Maine, Delaware, North Dakota, New Mexico and Alaska — haven’t had a resident make The Forbes 400 list in at least two decades. On the other hand, the picture has been getting much rosier in places like Arizona and Georgia, which joined the top 10 states for the first time in 2014 (when the latter was tied with Maryland and Tennessee at 7 list members) and now ranks No. 6 with 10 Forbes 400 residents. Iowa and Kentucky both had no 400 members in 2003 and now each have one: Harry Stine (worth an estimated $8.8 billion, who joined the list in 2014), and Tamara Gustavson ($7.4 billion, 2011), respectively. This is also a great year for Mississippi, which made the list for only the second time in two decades. Joining the ranks of the richest are Hattiesburg’s Duff brothers, who are behind the holding company Duff Capital Investors, which owns construction, energy and trucking firms. “Mississippi is a good place to do business, mainly because of our people, who are hard-working, optimistic and dedicated to providing a better future for their families,” says Thomas Duff, who’s worth an estimated $3 billion. “Keeping a Mississippi-based operation for our companies has helped us stay true to our values.” Sitting at the very bottom of the Forbes wealth ranking is Alaska, which has never had a resident make the 400 list since it was first published in 1982. That does constitute a loss for the Last Frontier. “You would love to have billionaires living in your state,” says the Tax Policy Center’s Auxier, explaining that the attraction is not just tax revenue but also the companies the wealthy often start or bring. “Someone just sitting on their money, they’ll take them, they don’t want to lose them — but if you talk to someone in these states, what they really want is a billionaire who is participating in the economy and hopefully has businesses in the state.” Of course, there’s only so much a state can do to court the rich. With great wealth comes great mobility. The Americans with the deepest pockets will go where they want. ",

        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "The U.S. economy “appears to be losing some of its luster,” according to Moody’s Analytics. Retail sales and manufacturing production dropped while job growth was mediocre in January.  But that hasn’t stopped the wealthy from spending. In fact, wealthy consumers who make at least $250,000 per year account for nearly 50% of all spending, a record since the government started tracking the data in 1989, a recent report from Moody’s Analytics shows.  Despite inflation and other economic headwinds that have caused many consumers to pull back, the rich are still comfortably spending on vacations and luxury goods. Rich Gen Zers and millennials who are dual-income-no-kids (DINKs) have seemingly led the charge on discretionary spending, according to a November 2024 Harris Poll survey. They’re shelling out on luxury and premium experiences in dining, travel, and personal development products.  Between September 2023 and September 2024, high-income individuals increased their spending by 12%, while working-class and middle-class households lowered their spending, according to Moody’s, which simply calls this shift the “wealth effect.” “Wealthier households are financially more secure and thus more able and willing to spend from their income,” Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi wrote in the Feb. 18 note. “That is, they save less than they would otherwise.” But the fact that the wealthy make up a majority of discretionary spending in the U.S. makes the economy unusually reliant on a small sliver of the population, Zandi told The Wall Street Journal.  Some economists argue the outsized influence of wealthy individuals doesn’t make the U.S. economy fragile in and of itself. But “an overreliance on high-income consumers can lead to problems if economic policies or market conditions significantly alter their spending behavior,” Peter C. Earle, senior economist at the American Institute for Economic Research, told Fortune.  Even if high-income earners were to significantly reduce their discretionary spending, they would likely reallocate that money into savings, investments, entrepreneurship, or business expansion, which still contribute to economic growth, Earle said. But there would be a short-term hit to the consumer economy, especially for luxury goods, high-end retail, travel, and entertainment, he added.  “Long-term prosperity hinges on savings, investment, and gains in productivity—none of which are necessarily diminished when wealthy individuals save more instead of spending,” Earle said.  Bob McNab, chair of the department of economics at Old Dominion University, however, sees the trend as “troubling for several reasons.” Higher income households are less likely to spend their last dollar earned than lower income households, making the group’s spending more difficult to influence by monetary or fiscal policy, McNab said.  “Simply put, if you give $1,000 to a lower-income household, they are likely to spend most—if not all—of it, while a higher-income household is likely to spend only a fraction and save the rest,” he explained.  Being reliant on high-income earners can also lead to “more pronounced swings” in economic activity, McNab said, because these households can easily cut discretionary spending during a slowing economy. This, in turn, “exacerbates the economic downturn,” he said. McNab also flagged deteriorating consumer sentiment as a reason to be concerned about the wealthy controlling spending in the U.S. “Once higher income earners believe a recession is coming, they will change their consumption behavior and, as result, increase the likelihood of a recession,” McNab said. “It becomes, in effect, a self-fulfilling prophecy.” Sydney Lake is an associate editor at Fortune, where she writes and edits news for the publication's global news desk. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

        "title": "Status Drives Millennials To Spend More On Luxury Goods. Is Conspicuous Consumption Coming Back?",
        "domain": "forbes.com",
        "text": "ByPamela N. Danziger, Senior Contributor. According to a new survey from Boston Consulting Group and Worth Media Group, affluent Millennials prioritize spending on luxury goods over experiences, challenging the popular notion that the next-generation is more experientially minded.  While Millennials indulge actively in luxury experiences – 54% spent on experiences in the past year – luxury goods take precedence, with 63% purchasing luxury goods. And 51% of Millennials expect to spend more on goods in the coming year, while 67% of GenXers and 80% of Boomers plan to spend less.  Underlying Millennials’ motivation for things over experiences is the status and prestige that come with them. A majority (54%) of Millennials surveyed are keen to display their wealth and accomplishments through luxury purchases and 70% are concerned about projecting the right image. And the status and prestige motivation was about 40% higher for Millennials than more mature consumers surveyed. “I was surprised by the scale and importance of status to the Millennials and it’s more important to them than across the other generations,” shared BCG’s Pierre Dupreelle, managing director, partner and one of the leads in its Fashion & Luxury practice. “The perception is Millennials are all about the experiences, but they are the generation spending most on status luxury goods.”  In other words, after going underground as the quiet luxury trend emerged post-pandemic, conspicuous consumption may be coming back with a vengeance now that Millennials (aged 28 to 43 years) are reaching the threshold where their incomes and wealth start to peak.  However, it won’t be as easy as slapping a bold logo on goods since nearly three-fourths of Millennials surveyed also expressed a desire for an “understated approach to my possessions and lifestyle.”  The BCG survey was conducted among 2,000 affluent Millennials (household income of $250k, and in high-cost cities over $350k, and $1 million or more net worth). It also included a comparative sample of 300 affluent GenXers and 300 affluent Baby Boomers. While Millennials give all the traditional reasons for purchasing luxury goods, like product quality reflected in materials and craftsmanship (79%), durability (78%) and value for money (69%), they are also driven strongly by other factors like brand recognition (70%), high ratings and review (70%) and scarcity (62%), which are far less significant to older generations. And sustainability (62%) and brand values or purpose (60%) also are more important for them than GenXers and Boomers. In typical surveys, it’s hard to tease out the importance of status since few people are willing to own up to wanting luxury goods to signal status and prestige, so the survey used a series of attitudinal questions to uncover that motivation.  Besides wanting to make an impression on others and to show off their wealth and success, Millennials have a strong desire to invest in themselves (87%) – hearkening to the classic L’Oréal slogan “Because I’m worth it” – and they are highly inclined to be influenced by public figures they consider role models (63%).  The reason why Millennials are more outer than inner-directed in their luxury purchases, as compared with older generations, may be down to one thing – social media. “This group grew up with social media, posting about how they look, what they wear, where they go on vacation, and how they feel,” said senior partner Jim Brennan, who works with Dupreelle on the investor side of BCG. “The influence of social media drives a lot of their behavior.” Dupreelle also noted that compared with the older generations, Millennials were more likely to have grown up in more affluent households and been exposed to luxury brands at an early age, so they have a high level of luxury brand recognition and they want luxury brands’ earned status to rub off on them.  “This generation is more complex to connect with, especially with the need to manage the sense of exclusivity and scarcity,” observed Dupreelle. “It’s going to require a new way of thinking to connect with these consumers.” Luxury brands must tread carefully as they try to align with the status and prestige drives of Millennials without making them feel too materialistic, acquisitive and inauthentic, never a good look for any consumer but most especially the socially-conscious and culturally-sensitive Millennials. Since the dawn of time, people have used symbols as a sign of one’s rank or position within the social hierarchy, the definition of social status. With the industrial age, such status symbols became more accessible to the masses, requiring artisans, designers and brands catering to a higher-class clientele to continually elevate the luxury status of their goods to distance and differentiate their offerings. So the status of luxury brands – an intersection of brand reputation and the perceived social circles in which its customers move – is inextricably linked to a consumer’s desire to purchase a brand to hitch their social status to the luxury brand’s wagon.  “Status is one of the key central motivations that explains why people buy luxury,” shares David Dubois, Ph.D., who is associate professor in marketing at INSEAD and has made the study of consumers’ status motivation a focus in his extensive research.  “Obviously, nobody cares to admit they want to build their status by purchasing luxury goods, so they emphasize other things like craftsmanship, quality, etc., but status building is very important because people want respect in the eyes of others.” Complicating the desire for luxury brands to enhance one’s social status are two conflicting motivations that Dubois has unraveled in his research:   These competing motivations play out differently depending upon the circumstance. For example, one might purchase a Louis Vuitton handbag because the brand is popular with one’s peers, i.e. assimilation, but choose a style that nobody else has, i.e. differentiation.  And depending upon the cultural context, one motivation may be more prominent than the other. “Looking through a cultural lens, we find the need for uniqueness is strong in places like the U.S. and Western Europe, whereas the need for assimilation is stronger in China,” he observes, noting why some brands may falter exporting their brand of luxury into foreign markets.  Luxury brands’ differentiation value can be diminished if they grow too big or their logos are displayed too prominently. “Luxury is about low volume and high margins and if that slips, the brand goes down in status by diluting its differentiating uniqueness,” he observes.  “The biggest risk to a luxury brand is to be spread too much.” And while the assimilation motive might seem to pertain primarily to those seeking to climb the social ladder, even those at the top of the ladder want to fit into their tribe. Status signaling is a primary driver for luxury purchases to everyone up and down the social hierarchy. An individual’s social status is critical to one’s personal identity and the brands they consume are a contributing factor in their identity, a variation on Descartes’ cogito, ego sum principle: “I consume, therefore I am.”  “Beyond being a signal of status, luxury brands are increasingly signals of identity. Are you a ‘Patagonia’ or a ‘Ralph Lauren’ person? And beyond being symbols of identity, they can become enablers of identity,” Dubois said.  That creates an opportunity for luxury brands to not just offer products but experiences to help craft one’s identity. He points to Panerai Xperiences Program, where for the price of a limited-edition Experiences watch, purchasers can participate in extreme sports, military excursions and other adventures. For example, Panerai collaborates with the U.S. Navy SEALs to put participants through rigorous training and immersive experiences in Florida.  Surely, being able to afford a Panerai watch says something about one’s social status, but being able to do what a Navy SEAL does takes status to a whole other level, not to mention the band-of-brothers’ camaraderie shared within the exclusive group.  Thus Panerai Xperiences meets and exceeds both the customers’ differentiation and assimilation motivations. Despite consumers wanting the status that owning luxury brands confers, Dubois warns of a “dark side” to luxury consumption that could deter consumers. Luxury consumers at all income levels, even high-income consumers, may feel conflicted by being perceived as inauthentic and having undue privilege.  They can worry about being viewed as antisocial, selfish, wasteful and over-materialistic. Even thinking about buying a luxury product compared with a non-luxury equivalent can create a feeling of “hubristic pride.”  Thus, consumers must weigh the rewards of luxury purchasing against the psychological risks.  “Such tensions are a reminder that the vehicles of status-pursuit constantly change in step with evolving norms and values that prevail in specific groups or at specific points in time, and of consumers’ need to navigate the complicated maze of status meanings associated with a wide array of luxury and non-luxury behaviors,” he wrote in a paper entitled “The psychology of luxury consumption.” Some are born with the silver spoon of status in their mouths, but the vast majority of people who achieve financial success that makes luxury purchases possible start by aspiring to reach affluent status.  And virtually every penny luxury brands spend on marketing and advertising – a heavy investment indeed – is meant to build aspiration and desire for the brand and its products. Aspiration and luxury go inextricably together.  Yet the luxury industry uses the term “aspiration” in a disparaging way. So-called “aspirational consumers” are considered second-class customers, and “aspirational brands” are relegated to a lower tier and not in the same class as true-luxury brands.  This ignores the obvious: aspiration for status is essential to the luxury business model.   “Consumers’ enduring drive for luxury largely derives from the need for status, that is ‘respect, admiration and voluntary deference afforded by others,’” writes Dubois. “This need drives the way consumers select, use and decode signals associated with high status in the marketplace. Status ‘leaks’ from these valued signals to their depositaries,” i.e. the customers.  The BCG survey reveals a powerful drive among Millennials to display their wealth and accomplishments and to project the right image. By ignoring consumers’ status motivation in luxury purchasing or worse, looking down upon them for having it, luxury brands may be missing opportunities to connect with this generation, which Bain predicts will account for between 50% to 55% of global luxury sales by 2030.  But it’s going to take some finesse because of the conflicting differentiation and assimilation motives for consumers when purchasing luxury brands and the positive and potentially negative feelings such purchases may inspire.  “Given the large heterogeneity in what consumers consider as a luxury, tensions may emerge among different forms of luxury consumption as status symbols become increasingly complex and acquire conflicting meanings in the marketplace,” Dubois concludes.",

She has published numerous articles about the race and class implications of federal tax policy.\n Dorothy Brown: We live with the myth that we have a progressive tax system In fact, she says, people like Mitt Romney, Barack Obama pay at lower rates than secretaries She says the low flat rate on dividends and capital gains protects the wealthy Brown: Getting rid of the progressive tax brackets is a step toward a fairer system \n            Last week we learned that Barack and Michelle Obama‚Äôs effective tax rate for 2011 was 20.5%.  They had adjusted gross income of $789,674.  We also learned that their tax rate was slightly lower than President Obama‚Äôs secretary, who had about $95,000 of income.  \n     \n            Ours is supposed to be a progressive rate system, which means as income gets higher, so do tax rates. In a true progressive rate system, Obama would never pay a lower tax rate than his secretary.\n     \n            We also know that Mitt and Ann Romney have a projected effective tax rate of 15% for 2011. They have requested an extension so we don‚Äôt have their actual returns. Their household income was just shy of $21 million. In a true progressive tax system, the Romneys would never pay a lower tax rate than the Obamas.  \n     \n            We do not have a progressive tax system. The notion of a progressive tax system is the lie that has been perpetuated far too long.\n     \n            First, not all income is taxed the same. While our income tax has always had progressive rates, for most of the 20th century a lower rate applied to certain nonwage income. That rate differential was increased dramatically as a result of the Bush tax cuts.  \n     \n            Most of the Romneys‚Äô income comes from stock ownership. Stock dividends and capital gains are generally not subject to our progressive rate system. Income from stock is taxed at a flat 15% rate. \n     \n            Fewer than 1 in 5 Americans owns stock in a way that qualifies for the flat rate.  Of that minority, very few benefit the way the Romneys do.  \n     \n            An analysis of IRS statistics show that for households up to $200,000, no more than about 5% of their income is eligible for the flat 15% rate. Those households combined represent well more than 90% of American households.  \n     \n            The Simpson-Bowles commission included a proposal that all income should be taxed the same.  While some would say that is a radical step, it is precisely what we did in 1986.\n     \n            Second, not all deductions are treated the same. Two-thirds of all taxpayers do not itemize their deductions but take the standard deduction. So, as a result, most Americans do not even benefit from the myriad of special interest group deductions found in our tax code.  \n     \n            In addition, under a progressive tax system, the value of a deduction depends upon what rate your last dollar is taxed. That is referred to as your marginal tax rate.   \n     \n            The more income you have, the higher your marginal tax rate and the greater the value of the deduction. \n     \n            For example, if your marginal tax rate is 35%, then for every dollar you spend, you save 35 cents.  If your marginal tax rate is 15%, then for every dollar you spend, you save only 15 cents. That explains why those in higher income brackets seek out tax deductions as a way to save money on their taxes.\n     \n            Third, all of this is supposed to be a secret. \n     \n            The only reason we have the information is because taxpayers voluntarily disclosed it ‚Äì either because they are presidential candidates or concerned citizens such as investor Warren Buffett.  The IRS statistics do a great job of masking this information because the real problem lies within the top 1% of taxpayers, and the data are not presented in a way that isolates that group.  \n     \n            Congress decides to enact a tax law, and the president signs the bill. While presidents voluntarily release their tax returns, members of Congress do not. The first step toward real tax reform would be for every member of Congress to release his or her tax return.  We can see which tax provisions benefit them, and we can compare their effective tax rates with our own.\n     \n            Achieving meaningful tax reform will require very few steps.\n     \n            First, tax all forms of income at the same rate. Second, repeal the progressive tax system and enact a flat tax. If a flat tax is good enough for Mitt and Ann Romney, it should be good enough for the rest of us.  \n     \n            Most flat tax proponents, however, want a flat tax, but they want to exempt income from stock completely.  That would mean Mitt and Ann Romney‚Äôs already low 15% effective tax rate would be cut even further.  That would be wrong-headed tax reform.\n     \n            Finally, most deductions should be eliminated. Most taxpayers do not itemize, so this change would only affect about one-third of taxpayers ‚Äì and their accountants and tax lawyers.  \n     \n            Whenever Congress enacts a deduction, it creates winners and losers.  That must stop. To be sure, every special interest group will oppose even the hint of this suggestion.  But we outnumber them.\n     \n            I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that the richest Americans pay taxes at a lower rate than most taxpayers and neither should you.\n     \nFollow us on Twitter: @CNNOpinion\n \nJoin us at Facebook/CNNOpinion\n \n  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dorothy Brown. \n © 2025 Cable News Network.

        "domain": "theatlantic.com",
        "text": "Democratic 2020 candidates are already discussing how to make a more progressive tax code. What’s the best way? With the 2020 primary already under way and the House back in Democratic hands, the left has proposed a number of spending programs aimed at ending poverty and boosting the middle class: a jobs guarantee, a Green New Deal, a massive expansion of the earned-income tax credit, Medicare for All, a universal child allowance, and on and on. Democrats do not want to talk about how to pay for each and every penny of such proposals. But it is clear they intend to raise more money from the rich, and are now pushing policies that would do just that. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to raise the top marginal income-tax rate to 70 percent; for every dollar a person earns over $10 million, Ocasio-Cortez suggests, he should be left with 30 cents. Senator Bernie Sanders, a likely 2020 candidate, wants to expand the estate tax. And Senator Elizabeth Warren, a definite 2020 candidate, has proposed an annual tax on wealth, taking 2 percent of fortunes over $50 million and an additional 1 percent of fortunes over $1 billion. The shared idea here is to make the tax code far more progressive as the left makes the government far more redistributive. Such tax policies tend to please liberals concerned that the party has failed to curtail inequality and to blunt its political effects, and terrify conservatives who argue that such policies are confiscatory and would hurt long-term growth. But what about the tax nerds? What do they make of these ideas on how to soak the rich? Shadi Hamid: Ocasio-Cortez understands politics better than her critics The green-eyeshade folks aren’t fond of short, easy answers. But, to start, experts said that there was nothing unusual or even that radical about what Ocasio-Cortez has in mind. Higher rates were common throughout the 20th century, with the top marginal rate averaging 78 percent from 1930 to 1980 and climbing up to 90 percent in the late 1950s and early ’60s. “Ocasio-Cortez has done a great public service in just saying, ‘You know, we could have higher rates,’” said Mark Mazur, an economist at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, D.C. “In the past, we have had them, and they worked. And you don’t have to go all the way to 70 percent. But right now we’re stuck with this question of whether the top rate should be 39.6 percent or 37 percent—that’s a pretty narrow range. What she’s saying is you can imagine taking them up a lot higher.” That said, if the goal is to raise more money for redistributive policies and to ensure that millionaires pay their fair share, Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal isn’t particularly efficient. It might not even raise that much money, instead discouraging employers from paying workers more than $10 million or workers from trying to earn more than that threshold. Imagine you were a lawyer who often earned in the high millions a year; if you hit the $9 million mark in the fall, you might work somewhat less, knowing that much of what you made over $10 million would get taxed away. The tax rate would, in effect, reduce inequality in pretax incomes, as well as in posttax incomes. (It would also encourage the very rich to hide income above $10 million.) A better way to extract money from top earners would be to get rid of the loopholes, deductions, and exemptions they use to shelter income from taxation in the first place, economists said. “Broadening the tax base is generally more efficient than changing rates,” said Kyle Pomerleau of the Tax Foundation, a think tank in Washington, D.C. “That would include getting at what I would call the Big Three, which is the charitable deduction, the home-mortgage-interest deduction, and the state- and local-tax deduction.” Derek Thompson: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has the better tax argument The charitable deduction allows very high earners to spend on nonprofit causes that they find interesting and valuable, as opposed to turning that money over to Uncle Sam for what the broad public wants and needs. (As the Trump Foundation so extravagantly shows, such charitable largesse is often anything but.) The home-mortgage-interest deduction prompts the rich to buy even fancier houses than they could otherwise afford. And the state and local deduction reduces the tax bills of rich families who happen to live in high-tax states. Together, the Big Three cost the government something like $100 billion a year. Eliminating these deductions would not just raise more money, but also reduce distortions in the economy, experts think: The government would no longer nudge billionaires to spend extravagantly on big houses or concert halls or hospital naming rights, or subsidize the cost of living in New York or California. There’s a whole slew of other deductions and exclusions, such as provisions for the owners of corporate jets, that the government would do well to erase, too. There’s also a strong case for raising the country’s preferential, low tax rates on dividends and capital gains and getting rid of the carried-interest loophole—provisions that cost the government about $130 billion a year. Right now investors pay a top rate of 23.8 percent on long-term-investment earnings, versus 37 percent on ordinary income. The argument for keeping that rate low is that it encourages investment. But the carried-interest loophole is a straightforward tax dodge for hedge-fund managers. Investment income is income and should be taxed more like regular income, many tax experts think. As for Warren’s wealth tax, that proposal comes from two of the world’s preeminent scholars on inequality, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley. (The former is in part responsible for much of the data showing the rise in income inequality in the United States; the latter literally wrote the book on the role of tax evasion in widening inequality.) Their wealth tax would raise an estimated 1 percent of GDP a year, or about $200 billion. Read: How America’s vision of progressive tax reform died “The main argument is that an annual progressive wealth tax is the most direct way to limit the increase in wealth concentration,” Zucman told me. “The wealth share of the top 0.1 percent has increased from 7 percent in 1980 to about 20 percent today. The wealth tax is the most powerful tool to catalyze wealth concentration—depending on the rate, to limit its increase or to make it shrink.” He added that a wealth tax would also “enable the government to tax people who have a lot of wealth, not a lot of income,” such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon. His 2017 salary: $81,840. His net worth: $135 billion or so, depending on the state of the stock market. With a wealth tax, very high-net-worth individuals would tally up the value of their estates—property, racehorses, art, business holdings, licensing fees, you name it—and pay a small share of that sum to the government annually; the government could use land, investment, and asset registers, as well as audits, to ensure compliance. “It’s very important that there are no exemptions,” so that the rich do not just shift assets around into classes that are not counted, Zucman told me. Still, tax experts said the wealth tax would be difficult for the government to administer. “If we all had all of our wealth in publicly traded securities, it would be easy, but we don’t, and that’s what makes it hard,” Mazur said. “People hold a lot of wealth in closely held businesses, like a car dealership or a ranching operation, or in partnerships that trade assets, like hedge funds. Those things are hard to value. What a wealth tax does is have the government say, ‘Rich people, raise your hands and tell us what your wealth is!’ They’re probably not going to give you a good answer.” There might be other ways to get at the same pool of people and the same pool of wealth without asking so much of the Internal Revenue Service. Pomerleau said the government might focus on taxing events where wealth changes hands, rather than assessing and taxing 75,000 people’s net worth each year. “It is easier to tax a transaction or transfer than an asset—there’s a market, and transactions are tracked,” he said. One option would be to jack up the estate tax, as Sanders wants to do, in essence creating a big, one-off wealth tax on the rich people who happen to die in a given year. Financial-transaction taxes would also hit the same pocket of very wealthy Americans. The minutiae of Warren’s, Sanders’s, and Ocasio-Cortez’s proposals aside, the tax code is riddled with provisions that let the richest Americans accumulate vast pools of wealth, worsening inequality and even fraying the country’s very democracy. There are better ways and worse ways to extract money from the rich, but Democrats have a strong argument that one way or another, the government ought to soak the rich.

Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Budget Committee, on Capitol Hill in February. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is turning the committee best known for writing budgets that never become law into a vetting ground for progressive policy. Sanders views his new jurisdiction as a broad mandate that \"essentially in one way or another, touches the lives of every American.\" In keeping with that vision, Sanders will introduce a pair of bills on Thursday to restore the corporate tax rate to 35% and add a new progressive tax on the estates of the wealthiest Americans. \"What we want to do is use the committee to focus on the crises facing the working class of this country, the middle class of this country, talk about issues like income and wealth inequality, talk about the mass amounts of tax avoidance and tax breaks that the very wealthiest people in this country, talk about student debt, talk about how much it will cost us if we do not address the existential threat of climate change,\" Sanders said in an interview with NPR. \"In other words, look at the major issues facing our country and focus a spotlight on them.\" Sanders is introducing the bills, both of which face long odds in the closely divided Senate, as part of a broader push to walk back tax cuts that were enacted under former President Donald Trump and to go further in redistributing the tax burden to corporations and the wealthy. The first bill would restore the corporate tax rate to 35%, undoing a cornerstone of Trump's 2017 tax overhaul. Republicans cut the corporate rate to 21% in that bill, a move that Joint Committee on Taxation valued at $1.3 trillion over 10 years. The bill would also end rules that allow companies to further reduce their tax bill by shifting operations offshore. A second bill would add a new way to tax the wealthiest estates in the country. Sanders says the bill is aimed at the fortunes of the top 0.5%. It would exempt the first $3.5 million of an individual's estate from the estate tax, $7 million for married couples. Those with estates between $3.5 million and $10 million would be taxed at 45%, and the rate would jump to 50% between $10 million and $50 million, 55% for estates over $50 million and 65% for estates valued at over $1 billion. The focus on taxes comes weeks after President Biden signed $1.9 trillion in new coronavirus relief spending into law. That bill, which Sanders helped move through the Senate, included billions for unemployment insurance, housing vouchers, rent assistance, stimulus checks and direct aid to millions of people. Democrats, who control 50 votes in the Senate, passed the legislation without any GOP votes using a budget tool called reconciliation. That process requires just 51 votes to pass and Democrats can muster those votes if they have unanimous agreement and call in Vice President Harris to break the tie. Congress gets one shot at reconciliation each time they pass a budget — which they can only do once every fiscal year which runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30 each year. They have two chances this year because Trump did not pass a budget in fiscal year 2020, and Democrats took the opportunity to pass one of their own when they took over in January. Sanders now oversees reconciliation as Budget Committee chair, and he is already contemplating what the second bill should include. \"The second reconciliation bill will deal with long-term structural problems that we've had in this country long before the pandemic,\" Sanders said. That includes spending on traditional infrastructure programs, like roads, bridges, water systems and wastewater. But Sanders says it should also include climate change and social programs like affordable housing. \"We need to build millions of units of low income and affordable housing,\" he said. \"We must address the crisis of climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel. And when we do those things, deal with infrastructure, deal with climate, we can in fact create many, many millions of good paying jobs.\" Those proposals are likely to reignite a familiar battle between centrist Democrats and the demands of the party's progressive base that Sanders represents. That fight was on display in the last reconciliation fight when Democrats failed to pass a $15 federal minimum wage. Just 42 Democrats voted for Sanders' plan to increase wages, and his long-term plans for wealth redistribution and cutting fossil fuels are certain to meet similar objections. When it comes to the minimum wage, Sanders says part of the challenge will be demonstrating that the Democratic Party is with him on the policy. \"There is not unanimity within the Democratic Caucus,\" he said. \"And my job is to rally the American people and to create a strategy.\" Some of that will involves creating pressure and spreading a message from the budget committee. When it comes to taxes, part of that message is that tax increases help pay for all of the spending Democrats have passed or plan to approve in the future. \"I do worry about the deficit that we have and the national debt that we have,\" Sanders said. \"And I worry that we have a tax system, which is in many ways extremely rigged. So you have large, profitable corporations over the years pay zero in federal income tax. \" Some, like Sanders, have suggested increasing taxes to help pay for that spending. Reshaping the tax code is part of his broader effort to redistribute wealth in the country. \"What we need to do, in the midst of massive income and wealth inequality, when the rich are becoming much richer, while the middle class struggles, we need a tax system, which says to the wealthy and large corporations that they're finally going to have to start paying their fair share of taxes,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, we need massive tax reform in this country, so that we end the tax loopholes and the giveaways that the wealthy and large corporations.\" As for when and how that gets done, Sanders says he isn't making any specific demands. But passing tax hikes outside of reconciliation creates a familiar problem for Democrats — they simply do not have enough votes to do something like that in the Senate where most legislation requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. That's why Sanders says it's time for the filibuster to end. \"As the Republican Party moves further and further to the right, their main task is obstructionism,\" Sanders said. \"And what we have got to say is that majority rules, when the American people want something when the House wants something, we cannot have just a minority of senators preventing us from moving so yes, I do support at this point, repealing the filibuster.\" But that's another issue where Democrats aren't unanimous — and they would need to be if they're going to make a change. Sanders himself used to be cautious about the ending filibuster. Doing away with the 60-vote requirement to pass legislation would give Republicans the chance to reverse policies and pass their own priorities if they controlled the Senate again. \"I think, in the best of all possible worlds, I would like to see a Senate where you can debate for long periods of time, etc., etc.,\" he said. \"But we're not in the best of all possible worlds.\" Asked if this new chairmanship and the influence it affords means he is done running for president, Sanders laughed. \"Well,\" he said. \"I am very content being the chairman of the budget committee and Vermont senator right now.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

Jay Inslee delivers his annual State of the State address to a joint legislative session in the House chambers of the state Capitol, Jan. 9, 2024, in Olympia, Wash. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson, File) \n SEATTLE (AP) — Outgoing Washington Gov. Jay Inslee is proposing a novel tax on personal wealth above $100 million in hopes of plugging a budget shortfall and averting cuts to education, mental health services and police. The tax would apply to about 3,400 residents — Microsoft founder Bill Gates among them — and bring in $10.3 billion over four years, Inslee, a Democrat, said Tuesday. No other states — and only a few countries — have taxes structured the way Inslee is proposing, according to the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning policy organization. A spokesperson for Washington’s Democratic governor-elect, Bob Ferguson, said he is reviewing Inslee’s proposal. Ferguson recently told The Seattle Times he would not rule out tax increases to cover the budget shortfall, which Inslee said is estimated at $16 billion over four years. Lawmakers in several Democratic-led states, including Washington, have in recent years proposed wealth or other taxes on their richest inhabitants, with Massachusetts voters in 2022 approving a “millionaire tax” — an income tax surcharge on those making more than $1 million a year.  Washington, which does not have an income tax, is considered to have one of the most regressive tax systems in the country, meaning lower-income residents pay a larger share than richer ones. Voters in November overwhelmingly upheld the state’s new capital gains tax against a repeal effort, demonstrating a desire to make the tax system fairer, Inslee said. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. \n “The state and the nation has to respond to this inequity beyond human imagination,” Inslee said. “We cannot survive as a healthy, robust community ... while we have this level of poverty and want amidst this enormous wealth.” \n Republicans in the Legislature blasted the proposal, saying the state has a problem with spending, not revenue. In an emailed statement, Rep. Travis Couture, of Allyn, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations committee, called it unserious. “Governor Inslee’s $13 billion tax hike and reckless spending increase show just how out of touch his administration is with the financial realities facing Washington families,” Couture said. The Tax Foundation calls wealth taxes “economically destructive,” saying they encourage perverse tax-avoidance strategies. Jared Walczak, the organization’s vice president of state projects, said Tuesday that only four countries have taxes on wealth — Norway, Spain, Switzerland and, recently, Colombia — while several others had repealed them, including Austria, Denmark, Germany and France. Such taxes can be challenging to administer because some assets — a private business that’s never been sold, for example — can be difficult to value, Walczak said. And unlike taxes on profits, taxes on wealth can cut into the principal value of an asset. The tax could be imposed even if the asset is losing money, he said. “This can significantly erode capital and discourage investment and economic growth,” Walczak said. Washington is among a number of states facing budget shortfalls. Inslee blamed inflation, higher caseloads in social safety net programs, and lower-than-expected state revenues from home sales and the capital gains tax. Inslee said that in addition to the wealth tax, his budget proposal includes increased taxes on about 20,000 businesses annual income of more than $1 million in the “service and other activities” category, such as some lawyers and accountants. It also includes $2 billion in cuts or delayed spending, including by shuttering the Mission Creek Corrections Center for Women because of less need for lower-security beds. ___ This story has been corrected to show that the governor talked about the proposal Tuesday, not Monday. \n \n  \n \n Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

And experts say having a conservative advocate sponsoring the bill could help the chances of finally getting a federal wage hike for the first time in 16 years.\n     \n            ‚ÄúGiven the fact that it‚Äôs a Republican leading this legislation, there‚Äôs certainly a different tone here, and a different group of people thinking about it than in the past,‚Äù said Rebekah Paxton, research director at Employment Policies Institute, a conservative think tank that opposes raising the minimum wage, arguing it will cost the jobs of lower-paid workers.\n     \n            Thirty-one states already require businesses to pay most workers above the federal $7.25 minimum ‚Äì including Missouri. That might be one reason why Hawley‚Äôs behind the bill.\n     \n            Come January 1, Missouri‚Äôs minimum wage will rise to $15 an hour. A higher starting wage means that businesses looking to expand nationwide might instead opt for a state that has a cheaper wage floor. A national $15 per hour wage would level the playing field, making Missouri competitive with places where businesses can legally pay less.\n     \n            ‚ÄúI think (Hawley‚Äôs sponsorship) is an admission that minimum wage increases are very popular,‚Äù said Ben Zipperer, senior economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that supports a higher minimum wage.\n     \n            ‚ÄúI would like to be optimistic about this. I do think it‚Äôs an important recognition that the problem with low pay continues to be a concern,‚Äù he said.\n     \n            The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour was set in July 2009, according to the Department of Labor, and has not changed since.\n     \n            But thanks to inflation ‚Äì including a surge in prices during the pandemic ‚Äì that wage has depreciated. People earning $7.25 in 2009 would need to earn $10.82 today to have the same buying power, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics calculator that uses the Consumer Price Index as an inflation reference.\n     \n            And while inflation is closer to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs 2% target now, the accumulation of more than a decade and a half of price increases means that Americans simply can‚Äôt afford the same kind of life now that $7.25 an hour bought in 2009.\n     \n            Hawley alluded to that erosion  in a statement about the bill.\n     \n            ‚ÄúFor decades, working Americans have seen their wages flatline. One major culprit of this is the failure of the federal minimum wage to keep up with the economic reality facing hardworking Americans every day. This bipartisan legislation would ensure that workers across America benefit from higher wages,‚Äù Hawley said in a statement. (Senator Peter Welch, a Vermont Democratic, is a co-sponsor.)\n     \n            Hawley‚Äôs press office did not respond to a request for further comment about the bill.\n     \n            In 10 states, as well as the District of Columbia, workers already make $15 an hour or more. In several more states, the rates could be higher than that next year, depending on inflation adjustments.\n     \n            All those states have Democratic senators likely to support a federal wage hike, excepting only Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine.\n     \n            In fact, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that in 2023, the most recent year with information, only 870,000 workers earn the $7.25 an hour minimum or less (the less is allowed for workers who receive tip income or some workers with disability). That‚Äôs only about 1% of the 80 million hourly workers nationwide.\n     \n            Far more people, however, make under $15 an hour ‚Äì about 14 million, Zipperer said.\n     \n            ‚ÄúThe economy has basically moved on‚Äù from wages that low, he added. But a pay increase to $15 an hour could do a lot to help those folks.\n     \n            ‚ÄúMinimum wage bills are always going to affect a minority of the work force,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúStill, that‚Äôs nothing to sneeze at.‚Äù\n     \n            But Paxton, of the conservative Employment Policies Institute, said a higher minimum wage could actually hurt those workers by cutting into the number of jobs or hours worked. With human workers earning bigger paychecks, employers could turn to automation or artificial intelligence. Already, AI leaders have warned that new advances in the technology could slash jobs for white-collar workers.\n     \n            ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a popular thing. People want to see workers earn more money,‚Äù Paxton said. ‚ÄúYes, it could boost wages, but it also could kill jobs for a sizable part of the workforce.

        "text": "While workers across many jurisdictions have already seen minimum wage increases with the start of the year, thousands more across over a dozen cities and states will see a pay bump heading into July as several laws take effect. Nearly two dozen states, cities and local municipalities will see some form of a minimum wage hike go into effect July 1, according to a report by the worker advocacy group National Employment Law Project. Jan. 1, 2025 marked a popular day for pay increases across the U.S., as 21 states and 48 cities raised their minimum wage rates. In total, 88 jurisdictions across 23 states were set to see minimum wage hikes by the end of 2025, the report said. Some of these July 1 increases pertain only to certain sectors, like California's wage hike for health care sector workers, or are part of a multi-step plan, like in Alaska, where wages will increase each year until reaching $15 an hour by 2027. It's estimated more than 880,000 workers in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C. will start earning a higher minimum wage starting July 1, according to a new report by economic policy think tank Economic Policy Institute. Here's where the increases are slated to take effect beginning July 1, 2025. Some local jurisdictions adjust their minimum wages annually for inflation each July, according to a June report by ADP. The changes often result in marginal increases in hourly rates that are less than a dollar. Several pertain only to workers in a specific sector or to businesses of a certain size. New wages effective July 1 include: Elsewhere in the country, Maryland's Montgomery County will raise pay to $15.50, $16 or $17.65 per hour, depending on the amount of employees, coming out to about a 50 cent raise. In Washington, D.C., minimum wage increases to $17.95 July 1, from $17.50.

        "text": "Watch CBS News \nUpdated on:  June 30, 2025 / 10:52 AM EDT\n            / CBS New York\n           Hundreds of thousands of workers across more than a dozen cities and states will soon receive higher pay, thanks to minimum wage hikes set to take effect July 1.  More than 800,000 workers in two states —Alaska and Oregon — as well as Washington, D.C., will be impacted by higher minimum wages that go into effect July 1, according to the left-leaning economic think tank Economic Policy Institute (EPI). Additionally, a dozen cities and counties are also set to boost their baseline pay rates next month.  The higher minimum wages come as the federal baseline rate remains at $7.25 an hour, where it's been parked since 2009. As the cost of living has crept higher in subsequent years, some states and municipalities have boosted their own minimum wages through a combination of ballot measures, inflation adjustments and legislation. \"These minimum wage increases will put more money in workers' pockets, helping many of them and their families make ends meet,\" EPI state economic analyst Sebastian Martinez Hickey wrote in a post about the higher pay. \"The average increase in annual wages for a full-time, year-round worker resulting from these minimum wage hikes ranges from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska.\" About 58% of the workers who will receive pay hikes are women, while Black and Hispanic workers will also disproportionately benefit, according to the EPI's analysis.  For example, in states where the minimum wage will increase in July, Black workers make up 7% of workers who will receive raises, but only 4.5% of the wage-earning workforce. Similarly, nearly 27% of Hispanic workers will see their wages rise, though they make up just over 13% of the wage-earning workforce.  While the federal minimum wage hasn't budged in 16 years, there have been periodic attempts to boost it, with the latest coming from Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, who earlier this month introduced legislation to increase the national baseline wage to $15 per hour. He was joined by Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch as a co-sponsor.  Alaska's baseline wage will rise by $1.09 to $13.00 an hour, which was approved via a ballot measure passed by voters. The boost will impact 6.3% of the state's workforce, or 19,400 people, who will see an average annual pay increase of $925, EPI calculates.  In Washington, D.C., 7.5% of the workforce, or 62,200 workers, will benefit from the minimum wage rising by 45 cents to $17.95 an hour, thanks to an inflation adjustment formula. With the new minimum in place, a full-time worker in the nation's capital will earn an additional $727 in annual wages, on average, according to the EPI's calculations. Oregon's minimum wage will rise 35 cents to $15.05 an hour on July 1, also through an inflation adjustment, boosting pay for 9.4% of the state's workforce, or 801,700 workers. The average pay hike will equate to $420 annually.  In addition to Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C., 12 more cities and counties across California, Illinois and Maryland will boost their minimum wages next month:  \n      © 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

They're among the many thousands of laws changing as a new year begins. Those wage increases will impact an estimated 9.2 million workers and raise pay by a total of $5.7 billion, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank that publishes economic research and examined the expected 2025 wage increases.  An additional 48 cities and counties will raise their minimum wages above their state wage floors starting Tuesday. California, which is increasing the minimum wage from $16 to $16.50, is one of the 14 states adjusting the minimum to increase for inflation. The average full-time minimum-wage worker in these states will make around $420 more annually, according to EPI. Five states are bumping up the statewide minimum wage through previously adopted legislation, and two states — Nebraska and Montana — are making changes after voters passed ballot measures. With these continued increases, EPI found that 19 states and Washington, D.C., will have at least a $15 minimum wage by 2027.  Meanwhile the federal minimum wage of $7.25  has not increased in 15 years and the spending power of one dollar is not what it used to be — putting workers in a tough spot as prices for groceries and housing have risen over time.  Research shows that a full-time minimum wage worker earning $7.25 an hour makes just $20 more than the poverty guidelines for a single-person household. Add kids or needing to care for other family members, and that worker falls below poverty levels. Drexel University's Center for Hunger-Free Communities found in 2021 that \"a true living wage\" that supports an individual's basic food and housing needs would be between $20 and $26 or more per hour depending on the state. \n                Dollar bills are shown in New York. The Economic Policy Institute says the Jan. 1 minimum wage increases show that the \"minimum wage continues to be a powerful tool for combating racial and gender wage disparities.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Lennihan/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Among those most directly benefiting from these wage increases are women and Black and Hispanic workers.  \"The January 1 increases show that the minimum wage continues to be a powerful tool for combating racial and gender wage disparities, supporting working families, and reducing poverty,\" EPI said in its report. Women make up almost 60% of workers seeing a raise, according to EPI's analysis. A little over 11% of workers seeing higher paychecks are Black, and nearly 40% are Hispanic. \n                College student Jimena Sanchez (right), who studies children's development, works as a part-time cashier earning minimum wage at a family store in Los Angeles on Oct. 11.\n                \n                    \n                    Damian Dovarganes/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n But the minimum-wage level may still be too low to keep up with rising prices and home costs, according to EPI. That's especially the case if a locality's minimum wage was tied to inflation years ago and has not been reexamined since. EPI pointed to Ohio, a state that last passed a significant increase to its minimum wage in 2007, and that will see it increase this year from $10.45 to $10.70 because of an inflation adjustment.   High food and housing costs were issues top of mind for voters in the 2024 election. Many polls and experts pointed to voters' unhappiness with the economy as a big reason for President-elect Donald Trump's reelection — despite experts, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, indicating that the U.S. economy was on good footing as 2024 came to a close.

Jan. 1, 2025 marked a popular day for pay increases across the U.S., as 21 states and 48 cities raised their minimum wage rates. Meanwhile, planned hikes are in place for at least four states and more than a dozen cities through the end of 2025, according to a report by the worker advocacy group National Employment Law Project. At the federal level, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va. introduced on April 8 the Raise the Wage Act, proposing to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $17 per hour and gradually end the \"subminimum\" wage for tipped workers. However, it faces a Republican trifecta across Congress and the White House. Here is what to know about minimum wage increases going into effect across the country in 2025. According to data compiled by the National Employment Law Project, the following states have enacted minimum wage increases after the New Year or are set for increases later this year: Here are some of the cities and jurisdictions seeing minimum wage hikes this year, according to data compiled by the National Employment Law Project: Minimum wage increases throughout the entirety of 2025 will directly impact 3 million workers earning minimum wage, and can also help bump up wages for another 6.2 million workers as companies adjust to the new minimum, USA TODAY previously reported. Wage jumps in recent years have helped some Americans try to keep up with inflation, which hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in mid-2022 before falling to 2.4% in March. However, some of the trade policies pursued by the Trump administration have experts concerned that inflation rates could rise again. Advocates have pointed out that some minimum wages are below what they call the \"living wage\" threshold for the cost of living in the area. Others argue that raising the minimum wage is associated with higher prices and job loss. Contributing: Paul Davidson, Diana Leyva, C. A.

        "text": "Minimum wage hikes traditionally have been aimed at helping low-paid workers afford the basics, such as food, medicine and housing. But a growing number of states and localities are raising their pay floors to $15 an hour or above, providing workers a somewhat larger financial cushion so they can not only pay for essentials with less of a struggle but also make some discretionary purchases.  Twenty-one states and 48 cities and counties are set to raise their minimum wages on Jan. 1, according to a report provided exclusively to USA TODAY by the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. Other states and a few more cities and counties will raise their minimum wages later in 2025. While the pay floor bumps mark an annual ritual, the report highlights an acceleration in the size of minimum wage increases in recent years. On New Year’s Day, three states – Illinois, Delaware and Rhode Island – will reach a $15 pay base for the first time, joining seven states already there or above it. Two states, California and New Jersey, are set to push their pay floors further above $17 for some health care workers. Meanwhile, 47 localities will also reach or top $15 on Jan. 1, including more than two dozen in California, most of which will climb further above $17. Burien, Washington, already subject to the state’s $16.28 minimum pay, will vault to $21.16 for employers with 500 or more workers in King County, making it the nation’s highest pay floor. “Remember that a full-time worker earning $17 per hour is only earning $35,360 annually pretax,” Yannet Lathrop, NELP’s senior researcher and policy analyst, wrote in an email. “Those wage levels won’t make workers wealthy, but they will help with paying for the basics, for a few luxuries (hopefully).\" She added, “Those higher wages may also improve their mental and physical health, their ability to access credit, and may lead to better educational outcomes of their children.” In January, several states will take a step in a series of minimum wage hikes over several years. Among the three hitting $15 for the first time, Illinois and Rhode Island are at $14 and Delaware is at $13.25. Others are increasing their minimums, but stopping short of $15. Missouri’s base pay will jump to $13.75 from $12.30 and Nebraska’s to $13.50 from $12. Kaamilya Hobbs, 33, of Kansas City, Missouri, earns $13.44 an hour working 20 to 25 hours at a local Arby’s. Her boyfriend mostly cares for their three children, a newborn and two toddlers, but sometimes does food delivery for DoorDash. Their combined pay is barely enough to pay basic expenses. Sometimes, the couple has to delay paying rent or a cellphone bill for 30 days. “It’s a little bit tricky,” Hobbs said.  “After rent and food and expenses for the kids, we don’t have too much left over to be able to do anything day to day.” Missouri’s minimum wage increase to $13.75 “would help a little,” she said. The family might have to juggle bill payments less often. Plus, she said, “I’d be able to visit my mom more often.” Now, she rarely visits her mother, who lives about 25 miles away, because of the gasoline cost. But Hobbs said she’s hoping for additional minimum wage hikes. “The cost of living is still going to be going up,” she said. “We can’t live on $13.75.” Many states – including Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Ohio and Virginia – are imposing smaller base pay rises linked to annual increases in the cost of living based on the consumer price index. Later in 2025, a handful of states and a couple dozen localities will also boost their minimum wages. The upshot: A total of 23 states and 65 cities and counties – a record 88 jurisdictions – will lift their pay floors sometime next year. The increases will directly affect 3 million workers earning minimum wage and indirectly nudge up pay for 6.2 million higher-paid employees because of ripple effects on company pay structures, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. What stands out, though, is the growing contingent of states at $15 an hour or higher. New York, California, Massachusetts, Washington, Maryland, New Jersey and Connecticut are already there. And besides the three joining that faction on New Year’s Day, Oregon will get there in July because of a cost-of-living rise. Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Missouri and Nebraska will hit the $15 benchmark by 2026 or 2027. That makes 16 states with nearly half the U.S. workforce in states with pay floors of $15 or higher within the next three years, according to the National Employment Law Project and the Economic Policy Institute. “Fifteen dollars is still the target rate,” Lathrop said. “It’s now the competitive rate.” Minimum wage increases in the past few years have helped Americans keep pace with annual inflation that reached a 40-year high of 9.1% in mid-2022 before gradually falling to 2.6% recently. As a result of the laws, “Workers and their families don’t have to choose which bills to pay,” Lathrop said. Yet none of the planned wage floors would meet the threshold of a “living wage” that would allow workers to afford basics such as food, child care, health care, housing, transportation, broadband, and other necessities, Lathrop said. In King County, Washington, for example, the minimum wage is poised to rise to $20.29 on Jan. 1. But the living wage for an adult with no children in the county is $30.08, according to the MIT Living Wage Calculator. Michael Saltsman, managing director of the Employment Policies Institute, which is backed by the restaurant industry, noted that at least some minimum wage workers aren't financially squeezed because they live in households with higher total incomes. The $15 threshold was deemed a pipe dream when Fight for $15, an alliance of fast-food and other low-paid workers, began demanding it in walkouts across the nation starting in 2012. On April 1, however, the minimum hourly wage for fast-food workers in California leaped from $4 to $20, pushing it well above the state's standard $16 pay threshold. Meanwhile, the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009, with Republicans in Congress repeatedly blocking efforts to raise it. About 30 states with more than 60% of the U.S. workforce have higher pay floors than the federal government’s. Lathrop, though, says the issue transcends politics. This year, Alaska and Missouri, both Republican-dominated states, became the latest to pass ballot initiatives raising the minimum wage to $15 over the next few years. Saltsman, for his part, noted that voters in California and Massachusetts, two predominantly Democratic states, this year rejected proposals to raise the minimum wage for specific groups of workers. “They’re associated with higher prices and loss of jobs,” he said of the pay increases. Restaurants, he said, have passed along their higher labor costs to consumers by raising food prices. And the wage hikes have forced many eateries to close or lay off workers, he said. Various studies have supported both sides of the debate. Analyses by the University of California, Berkeley, and the National Bureau of Economic Research found that pay increases didn’t cause job losses within low-wage industries but did lead to some reduced employment among teens and other low-skilled workers. In 2021, a Congressional Budget Office report concluded that boosting the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would raise incomes for millions of Americans and lift 900,000 people out of poverty but reduce employment by about 1.4 million workers within a few years. Economist Dante DeAntonio of Moody’s Analytics said the minimum pay increases haven’t had a noticeable effect on inflation, in part, because the share of workers at or below the pay floors is small. State minimum wage hikes each January have contributed to sharper inflation early in the year but haven’t moved the needle on overall price increases in the months that followed, said Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist of Oxford Economics.",

After the wave of wage hikes, Washington will become the state with the highest minimum wage, offering workers $16.66 per hour. Workers in California and New York will enjoy the second-highest wage floor, as both states implement a minimum hourly wage of $16.50. Pay increases set to take hold in the new year will bring the wage floor to $15 an hour or higher in Washington, D.C., as well as 10 states, among them Delaware, Illinois and Rhode Island. Those areas play host to one of every three U.S. workers, EPI found. Overall, the states set to raise their minimum wage on Wednesday include: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington. The nation's highest wage floors will take effect in some of the nearly 50 cities and other localities that will impose minimum pay hikes. Twenty-nine cities in California will see pay hikes, including a $17-an-hour wage floor that will take effect in Oakland. Seven localities in Washington will increase their minimum wage, among them the country's highest wage floor: $21.10 an hour in Tukwila. The latest round of pay increases, however, will not affect more than a dozen states concentrated in the South that lack a minimum wage or offer a minimum wage that does not exceed the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour. The last federal minimum wage hike took place in 2009, when Congress raised the pay floor to its current level. When adjusted for inflation, the federal minimum wage stands at its lowest level since February 1956, nearly 70 years ago, EPI found. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

The increases ‚Äî which range from 18 cents to $1.75 (hello, Delaware) ‚Äî are expected to affect more than 9.2 million workers, raising their pay by a combined $5.7 billion, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\n     \n            Additionally, about four dozen cities and municipalities (mostly in California, Colorado and Washington) hiked their minimum wages further above their respective state floors, according to EPI.\n     \n            ‚ÄúThese additional earnings are critical for ensuring workers don‚Äôt lose ground due to rising prices, but the minimum wage level may still be too low, especially if the minimum wage was indexed years ago and not revisited since,‚Äù Sebastian Martinez Hickey, a state economic analyst for the EPI, wrote in a recent blog post on the topic.\n     \n            And that‚Äôs especially true after a period of rampant inflation that caused the cost of living to soar even higher.\n     \n            The pandemic and the economic recovery that followed further exacerbated the chasm between the haves and the have-nots. In turn, labor movement activity has swelled ‚Äî as have pushes for a $17 federal minimum wage.\n     \n            The federal minimum wage continues to sit at $7.25 an hour, a rate that hasn‚Äôt budged since 2009. As of now, 20 US states have a minimum wage at or below the federal level, with a handful ‚Äî Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee ‚Äî not adopting any type of wage floor.\n     \n            While congressional efforts to hike the federal minimum wage stalled out, this past year did see the largest-ever minimum wage increase in recent US history on the state level.\n     \n            California, on April 1, 2024, implemented a sectoral minimum wage hike for fast food workers in the state, raising their base pay by $4 to $20 an hour.\n     \nRelated article\nCalifornia just hiked minimum wage for fast food workers.

Those typically smaller (and often more vulnerable businesses) were found to offset the wage increases with higher wages as well as higher levels of productivity, according to findings from Nirupama Rao, assistant professor of business administration, and co-author Max Risch.\n     \n            ‚ÄúThe hue and cry over the minimum wage is often disproportionate to the actual economic impact ‚Äî in terms of how the economy broadly is impacted,‚Äù Rao told CNN. ‚ÄúFirms offset [minimum wage increases] with new revenues, but workers get substantially larger incomes.‚Äù\n     \n            And, for those workers, wage boosts can have an immeasurable effect.\n     \n            ‚ÄúWhat we find is that earnings go up significantly four years after the minimum wage increase: The typical low-earning workers are earning roughly $1,500 more per year than a similar worker in a state that did not change the minimum wage,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis goes without saying but $1,500 to a minimum wage worker is a very large change in their earnings.‚Äù\n     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

        "text": "Published May 15, 2025 at 10:14 AM EDT updated May 15, 2025 at 02:48 PM EDT US News Reporter Los Angeles lawmakers have advanced a measure that would make the city home to the nation's highest minimum wage, approving a plan to raise hourly pay to $30 for tens of thousands of tourism workers by 2028, the year the city is set to host the Olympic Games. The Los Angeles City Council voted 12-3 on Wednesday to approve the proposal, which applies to hotels with more than 60 rooms and businesses operating at Los Angeles International Airport. The tourism industry is one of the top five employers in Los Angeles County, supporting more than 540,000 Angelenos, according to the American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA). However, there have been growing concerns about the sector, which has not fully rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, Los Angeles only saw 79 percent of the number of international visitors it had in 2019, according to the AHLA. The association warned that \"slower-than-anticipated pandemic recovery\" coupled with other factors, including the wildfires, have massively impacted the tourism industry. Industry groups argue that the wage plan will add pressure to businesses already struggling with staffing and a drop-off in tourism. The measure would result in a 48 percent wage increase for hotel workers and a 56 percent rise for airport employees over the next three years. The minimum wage for large hotel workers is currently two dollars higher than the standard minimum wage in the city, at over $18. The wage increases would be brought in gradually, starting with $22.50 per hour in July 2025, increasing to $25 in 2026, $27.50 in 2027, and finally $30 in July 2028. Several other amendments are also being proposed to the existing Hotel Worker Minimum Wage Ordinance. The new ruling would also enforce training requirements. Employers must provide six hours of paid training annually to each employee, covering safety, worker rights, harassment, discrimination and other topics. The ordinance would also instruct hotel employers to provide $8.35 per hour for their workers' health care by July 2026. Jessica Durrum, deputy director of Policy and Campaigns at Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy (LAANE), told Newsweek: \"This policy updates existing laws to ensure that the workers who keep Los Angeles' profitable tourism industry running are healthy and housed. As Los Angeles prepares to host a wave of megaevents leading up to the 2028 Olympics, this is a critical measure to make sure that tourism workers can afford to live in the city where they work and not be displaced by skyrocketing housing costs. \"It's also a commonsense measure that will enrich the entire city because when workers have more money in their pockets, they spend it in the local economy. We know for a fact that the tourism industry has thrived after past similar wage increases, and that there are positive economic impacts. In terms of this new policy, an economic impact study commissioned by Los Angeles City Council found that this new law will result in an estimated increase of over $1.2 billion in income regionally by 2028, with approximately two-thirds of the wage gain spent locally.\" Los Angeles City Council member Monica Rodriguez told Newsweek: \"I opposed this increase because while the intent may be well-meaning, the execution lacks fiscal foresight. This policy imposes a significant wage and health benefit increase overnight that will inevitably result in higher hotel rates, reduced hours for hotel workers, and job losses–not just in hotels, but across businesses that rely on tourism: restaurants, retail, attractions, and our struggling commercial corridors. Tying the wage increase to the 2028 Olympics may sound appealing, but the reality is that many of those events are happening outside city limits, yet this increase only impacts the City of Los Angeles making our hotels less competitive and undercutting our ability to attract tourists resulting in a loss of TOT, taxes and other economic impacts that the City will lose as we are facing a $1 billion deficit and laying off workers. \"My concern remains that we are on a path to having the highest-paid unemployed workforce in the country, where wages go up, but job opportunities disappear because we failed to think through the economic impact on our small businesses, hotels, and the broader tourism sector.\" Los Angeles City Council member Hugo Soto-Martínez told Newsweek: \"This is what it looks like when working people come together and fight – we win. For too long, the workers who make this city run have been treated as disposable. This ordinance makes it clear if you work in this city, you deserve to live in this city — with dignity, health care, and a living wage.\" The Hotel Association of Los Angeles, in an October 2024 letter to the chair of the Economic, Community Development and Jobs Committee: \"The proposed Hotel Worker Minimum Wage Ordinance is misguided and its economic impact analysis utterly incomplete. The proposed ordinance calls for a dramatic increase in hotel wages within 60 days of adoption. Increasing hourly wages to $24.40 with an additional $8.35 for health benefits would result in a 69% increase in payroll in just two months. No industry can afford that financial uptick in such a short period of time.\" The American Hotel and Lodging Association's 2025 report on tourism in Los Angeles: \"Los Angeles' tourism industry has historically been a top contributor to the city's economy. However, the compounded effects of a lagging pandemic recovery, the devastating wildfires, soaring operational costs, and decreased international travel have brought the hospitality industry to an inflection point. \"If the situation does not improve soon, the industry anticipates more permanent hotel closures and worker layoffs, which would impact thousands of residents, cost the city millions in tax revenue, and jeopardize the success of upcoming major international events such as the World Cup and Olympics.\" The council will hold a second vote on the proposal next week. If approved again, the ordinance will take effect and begin phasing ahead of the 2028 Olympic Games.

        "text": "Published Jun 28, 2025 at 07:18 AM EDT US News Reporter Hundreds of thousands of workers across the U.S. are set to get a pay bump starting July 1, as minimum wage increases take effect in more than a dozen states, cities, and counties. According to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), more than 800,000 workers in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C. alone will see their baseline pay go up next month. Another dozen local jurisdictions—mostly in California—will also implement increases. The pay hikes come as the federal minimum wage remains stuck at $7.25 per hour, unchanged since 2009. With the cost of living continuing to rise, many states and cities have raised their own minimums through legislation, ballot measures or inflation adjustments. In Alaska, the minimum wage will rise by $1.09 to $13.00 an hour, an increase approved by voters through a ballot measure. EPI calculates the boost will affect 19,400 workers—about 6.3 percent of Alaska's workforce—and add an average of $925 per year to their paychecks. Washington, D.C. will raise its minimum by 45 cents to $17.95 an hour due to an automatic inflation adjustment, impacting an estimated 62,200 workers, or 7.5 percent of the city's workforce. The average worker there will earn about $727 more per year. In Oregon, about 801,700 workers—roughly 9.4 percent of the state's workforce—will see their minimum wage climb 35 cents to $15.05 an hour, also tied to inflation. That's an average annual increase of $420 per worker. Beyond those statewide and D.C. changes, minimum wages will increase in 12 cities and counties next month. That includes 10 cities and counties in California, with increases ranging from 45 to 59 cents an hour. New hourly rates will range from about $17.46 in Alameda to nearly $20 in Emeryville—one of the highest local minimum wages in the country. Cities including Berkeley and San Francisco will see their wages climb to $19.18 an hour, while workers in Los Angeles and surrounding areas will earn just under $18. Outside California, Chicago, Illinois, will boost its minimum wage by 40 cents, bringing it to $16.60 an hour. And in Maryland, Montgomery County will increase its minimum wage by 50 cents to $17.65 an hour. The EPI estimates that about 58 percent of workers benefiting from the July 1 hikes are women, while Black and Hispanic workers will also disproportionately gain. \"These minimum wage increases will put more money in workers' pockets, helping many of them and their families make ends meet,\" EPI state economic analyst Sebastian Martinez Hickey said. \"The average increase in annual wages for a full-time, year-round worker resulting from these minimum wage hikes ranges from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska.\" Calls to raise the federal wage persist. This month, Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri and Democratic Senator Peter Welch of Vermont introduced a bipartisan bill to lift the federal minimum to $15 per hour—more than double the current rate. Starting July 1, employers will have to ensure they review the changes made in different cities to minimum wage rates and pay their employees accordingly. © 2025 Newsweek Digital LLC",

        "domain": "cbsnews.com",
        "text": "Watch CBS News \nJune 10, 2025 / 6:03 AM EDT\n            / CBS News\n           Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley plans to introduce legislation Tuesday to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour — a position that aligns one of the most conservative Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill with some of the most liberal members of Congress. The legislation, called the \"Higher Wages for American Workers Act,\" would raise the federal standard starting in 2026 and would also call for an increase in subsequent years to match inflation, CBS News has exclusively learned. Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch has signed on as a co-sponsor.  \"For decades, working Americans have seen their wages flatline. One major culprit of this is the failure of the federal minimum wage to keep up with the economic reality facing hard-working Americans every day,\" Hawley said in a statement to CBS News. \"This bipartisan legislation would ensure that workers across America benefit from higher wages.\" \"We're in the midst of a severe affordability crisis, with families in red and blue states alike struggling to afford necessities like housing and groceries,\" Welch said in a statement to CBS News. \"A stagnant federal minimum wage only adds fuel to the fire. Every hard-working American deserves a living wage that helps put a roof over their head and food on the table — $7.25 an hour doesn't even come close.\"  The federal minimum wage currently sits at $7.25 per hour and has not risen since 2009, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The move by Hawley puts him at odds with conservative party orthodoxy, which has traditionally opposed a federal minimum wage increase on the grounds that it would be costly for businesses and ultimately, for consumers. But Hawley's pitch is reflective of the party's realignment in the Trump era, where the president's brand of populism has fueled a shift among working-class voters away from Democrats and toward Republicans.  Hawley has been pushing Republicans to embrace this shift. The minimum wage legislation is part of a broader, aspirational package of legislative proposals he dubbed the \"Pro-Worker Framework for the 119th Congress.\" This includes a proposal to help strengthen protections for union jobs, as well as for organizing and collective bargaining.  Earlier this year, he teamed up with Sen. Bernie Sanders to introduce legislation to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. And in the last Congress, he introduced legislation that would require companies with revenues of $1 billion or more to pay their employees at least $15 per hour. In recent weeks, Hawley has been urging his party against cuts to Medicaid benefits in the budget reconciliation bill.  In November, voters in Hawley's home state of Missouri approved a ballot measure to raise the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour, starting in 2026. But the Legislature repealed part of the law that would allow later increases to adjust for inflation.  Earlier this year, President Trump rescinded a Biden-era executive order that raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $17.75 per hour. At his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he does not support raising the federal minimum wage, arguing that it is a decision best left up to the states.  \n      © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

        "domain": "cbsnews.com",
        "text": "Watch CBS News \nMarch 5, 2025 / 3:01 PM EST\n            / CBS Baltimore\n           Maryland lawmakers, labor advocates and tipped workers shared support during a rally Wednesday for a proposed bill that could raise Maryland's minimum wage to $20 per hour.  If passed, the No Tax on Tips Act would phase in the minimum wage increase by 2027 and strengthen wage theft enforcement.  The bill would also establish consumer protections for service fees that restaurants charge.  The proposed bill dictates that restaurants and other food service locations would not be able to charge a service fee unless the facility discloses the fee to the customer on the menu or in another visible location before an order is placed.  The restaurant would have to clarify what the service fee is for and if it is paid directly to employees in addition to wages. Violations of the rule would be considered as an unfair or deceptive practice, warranting penalties.  Under the proposed bill, employers would have to pay each employee either the federal minimum wage or the state minimum wage. Subminimum wages for tipped workers would be eliminated. As of January 2024, Maryland's minimum wage is $15 and is not scheduled to increase in 2025.  The bill would increase the state's minimum wage to $17 per hour by January 2027 and to $18.50 by January 2028. In July 2028, the minimum wage would increase to $20 per hour under the bill.  If an employee is under 18 years old, an employer would be allowed to pay them 85% of the state's minimum wage.  Under the bill, certain employers who hire tipped workers would not be allowed to include a tip amount as part of the employees' wages.  The bill would exempt tips from being taxed and would offer tax credits for small businesses.  Under the bill, an employer would be allowed to pay their employees an amount that represents the tips an employee usually receives. The tip credit amount cannot exceed the minimum wage for the employee.  If the bill passes, starting in July 2028, employers would not be allowed to include the tip credit as part of the employee's wage and would be required to pay the employee the state's minimum wage.  The bill does not prevent employers from paying tips to employees. During Wednesday's rally, advocates called on lawmakers to pass the bill, ensuring workers in Maryland are paid fairly and tipped workers have protections against wage theft.  According to the group, five major labor unions have shared their support for the bill, including the Maryland State Education Association (MSEA). Advocates pointed to a poll conducted by Fred Yang of Hart Research Associates that revealed 72% of Maryland voters and 81% of unlikely voters support raising the minimum wage to $20 an hour and eliminating the subminimum wage for tipped workers.  The poll also showed that 78% of voters cited the rising cost of living as their reason for supporting the legislation.  The bill had a hearing in the state Senate Wednesday.  \n      © 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

        "text": "ByJaime Catmull, Contributor. For decades, conventional wisdom said Americans didn’t want affordable housing in their own communities. The not-in-my-backyard, or NIMBY, mindset was thought to be an immovable obstacle—support in theory, opposition in practice. But new national survey data tells a very different story. According to a poll of 1,000 U.S. adults conducted by Talker Research and commissioned by Built, a construction-finance technology company, 83% of Americans say they support affordable housing being built in their own neighborhoods. That finding runs counter to years of political assumptions and suggests a shift that could have real implications for household finances, community development, and the long-running national housing crisis. Housing affordability has become one of the defining financial challenges of our time. According to the US Census Bureau, roughly 21 million American households spend more than 30% of their income on rent, and millions more are locked out of homeownership altogether. Even middle-class families are struggling to keep up with high mortgage rates, escalating insurance premiums, and persistent supply shortages. If you’re a renter or prospective homebuyer, the lack of available, affordable units drives up your costs. If you already own, housing scarcity still affects your neighborhood—through higher property taxes, longer commutes for essential workers, and diminished local services when teachers, nurses, or first responders can’t afford to live nearby. The survey’s finding of broad public support signals that policy and market forces may finally align. If more Americans are open to affordable housing in their own backyards, the political and zoning obstacles that have slowed construction for decades may start to give way. One of the most surprising takeaways from the survey is how bipartisan the support is. Housing has long been a polarizing issue, with debates over rent control, zoning, and subsidies often breaking down along party lines. Yet Built’s data shows consensus. Ninety-two percent of Democrats say they would support affordable housing in their neighborhoods. Eighty-three percent of Independents agree. And perhaps most striking, 74% of Republicans say yes as well. That rare agreement suggests that Americans across the spectrum increasingly view housing affordability not as an ideological issue, but as a practical one tied directly to family finances and community stability. If public support is this broad—and Congress is advancing proposals like the Community Investment & Prosperity Act, the ROAD to Housing Act, and the Housing Affordability Act—the natural question is: why aren’t more units being built? The answer is partly structural. Housing construction depends on a financing system that often lags behind demand. Developers struggle with lengthy approval processes, inconsistent zoning laws, and outdated infrastructure funding. Even when the political appetite exists, the financial machinery to actually deliver projects often doesn’t. That may be changing. Private capital, new federal incentives, and local initiatives are beginning to accelerate. Cities from Atlanta to Minneapolis have eased restrictions to allow more multi-family units. States like California have mandated accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, as a right. And bipartisan momentum in Washington signals that federal support may flow more consistently in the coming years. For everyday families, that could translate into more housing options, less upward pressure on rents, and eventually, more accessible pathways to homeownership. For years, opponents of affordable housing often couched their arguments in terms of preserving property values, avoiding congestion, or maintaining neighborhood character. But the survey suggests that calculus is shifting. With more Americans struggling to find affordable options, as noted in a McKinsey Institute for Economic Mobility Report, resistance has softened. Most people know someone who has been priced out of the market, whether it’s adult children, aging parents, or essential workers. The pandemic underscored how much neighborhoods rely on proximity to service workers. When nurses, grocery clerks, or teachers can’t afford to live nearby, the whole community feels the impact. Generational dynamics are also at play. Younger voters, who face steeper housing costs than their parents did, are more supportive of affordable development. Their growing political influence is reshaping local and national debates. At the same time, more homeowners are beginning to see affordable housing not as a threat but as a stabilizing force, ensuring that essential community members can stay and that local economies don’t collapse under the weight of scarcity. Perhaps the most counterintuitive detail from the survey is that affordable housing is more popular than apartments, townhomes, or even mobile homes. That suggests Americans don’t just tolerate the idea—they prefer it. For policymakers, that may be the green light needed to prioritize affordable projects over more conventional developments. For families, it means the future of neighborhood growth may look different than expected. If political and financial barriers continue to fall, more affordable units will enter the market. That could help stabilize rents and cool overheated home prices in some regions. With more projects gaining approval, expect to see affordable housing built closer to existing residential areas. The survey suggests neighbors may welcome it more than in years past. And with bipartisan support, proposals once dismissed as unrealistic now have a path forward. America’s housing shortage is vast, and no single policy or project will solve it overnight. But the new survey data should challenge outdated assumptions. Most Americans no longer fit the NIMBY stereotype. They see affordable housing as a financial necessity and a community benefit. That matters for investors weighing where to allocate capital, for policymakers drafting housing bills, and most importantly, for families deciding where—and how—they can afford to live. As Chase Gilbert, CEO of Built, put it: “Affordability challenges have gone mainstream. More people are realizing affordable housing isn’t about charity—it’s about keeping the American dream within reach.” For personal finance readers, the bottom line is clear: affordable housing may be coming to your neighborhood sooner than you think—and unlike in decades past, most of your neighbors may welcome it.",

        "text": "Watch CBS News \nAugust 25, 2025 / 7:19 PM PDT\n            / CBS San Francisco\n           California's housing shortage took an entire generation to create, and here in the Bay Area, much of the blame lies with state rules that allowed cities to refuse new development. But now, even with those regulations being relaxed or eliminated, developers say market forces are preventing any housing booms from happening. Elected officials and builders met Monday for a groundbreaking ceremony. A new 10-story development at 300 De Haro Street will add 425 units of 100 percent affordable housing to San Francisco, designed specifically for working people with middle incomes. It's something that's desperately needed, but under the previous rules, it may not have been possible. \"We would not be standing here because the project wouldn't be entitled, most likely,\" said Mark McDonald, CEO of DM Development. \"Development in San Francisco is challenging. There's a lot of hurdles. So, a lot of projects either are delayed or are never built.\" McDonald's company is the developer behind the 300 De Haro project. It was the first site in the state to be approved under Senate Bill 35, a measure passed in 2017 that forces cities to accept affordable housing projects. \"It wasn't a 'yes' or 'no' anymore.  It was, 'This is going to happen,\" said Corey Smith, executive director of the Housing Action Coalition.   He, like most activists, wants to see housing built quickly. But he's had to accept some hard truths. \"While we do need to operate with urgency, to have this go faster, and we're not seeing a bunch of housing breaking ground today that we would hope for. I have accepted the fact that this is going to be a multi-decade fix,\" he said. \"That is just the reality of it, unfortunately.\" That's because market forces are holding things up. First and foremost is the increase in construction costs, which at one point rose by one percent per month. Also, there is a lack of capital available as investors turn to safer sectors in a time of high interest rates. Then there was a post-COVID stagnation in rent.   In layman's terms, it simply doesn't pay to build housing in the current environment. \"First, we had COVID that scared away a lot of institutional investors, and they simply red-lined San Francisco in investment committee,\" said McDonald. \"That's changing now. The narrative around the city is changing now.\" 300 De Haro was originally planned as market-rate housing, but without the benefit of government subsidies, most of that kind of construction has come to a halt. So, McDonald's company shifted gears to the affordable side, and now he said costs are leveling off and rents are starting to rise, good news for developers. And he said the old \"doom loop\" image of San Francisco is starting to go away. \"So, I have seen this movie four times now. Everybody leaves San Francisco for dead, and then it rises like a phoenix out of the ashes,\" he said. \"It has happened every single time and it's going to happen this time, and it's happening as we speak.\" If all goes as planned, the 300 De Haro housing complex will be finished sometime in the summer of 2027. It is intended for working people with incomes between $45,000 and $95,000 per year. It took six years for the project to even begin construction, and it will take a generation for San Francisco to get the housing it needs. But that may actually be possible now that the State and cities have gotten out of the way. \n      © 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

One of them is Hill Memorial Baptist Church on North Harvard Street in Allston. It opened back in 1903 and has been vacant since it closed in 2023. The Community Development Corporation in Allston-Brighton plans to turn it into a $48 million community center that will also include 49 units for affordable senior housing. \"Rather than destroy this symbol of the past, [we want to] make it into something usable,\" said the corporation's executive director John Woods.   \"Residents will be able to live here, come home,  but also if they need elderly services or any type of community space. We are hopefully having a library,  a gym, some meeting rooms for the residents,\" said project manager Mara Tu. Construction is set to begin by the end of the year, which could not come at a better time, according to Boston's Age Strong Commissioner Emily Shea. She said the need for affordable senior housing is critical.  \"Just at the Boston Housing Authority alone, we have over 11,000 older adults that are currently housed in affordable units. And we have another 10,000 people over the age of 65 on the wait list,\" Shea said. The Archdiocese of Boston said they've converted nearly a dozen of their properties into affordable and mixed income homes, including St. Aidan's Church in Brookline. \"When we are having conversations with parishes, with pastors, it's about how can we continue to preserve our legacy of service and help to continue to meet the needs of the community. An effective way to do that is to look at the property and to see how it can be repurposed for affordable mixed-income housing,\" said Bill Grogan, the President of the Planning Office for Urban Affairs for the Archdiocese. \n      © 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Podcasts: True crime, in-depth interviews and more USA TODAY podcasts right here Dana Taylor: Hello, I'm Dana Taylor, and this is a special episode of USA TODAY's The Excerpt. Lack of affordable housing is an urgent problem in cities and states across America, but perhaps nowhere is it felt more acutely than in California. That's where a 55-year-old regulation known as CEQA, the California Environmental Quality Act, has created a lengthy process, a review process that's been blamed for gumming up the developmental pipeline, but in June, in a move that angered environmentalists, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed two bills that effectively roll back portions of CEQA. What happens now, and will the impact finally pave the way for developers to create the housing so desperately needed? Ben Metcalf, Managing Director of the Turner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley joins us to talk about what this might mean for housing in California. Ben, thank you so much for joining me. Ben Metcalf: It's my pleasure. I'm very happy to be here. Dana Taylor: Set the stage for us here. There's been a partial rollback of CEQA, the signature law which has largely been blamed for holding up new housing projects. What were the issues CEQA was originally trying to address, and what parts did Newsom effectively repeal in June? Ben Metcalf: CEQA was one of a number of state-level sort of environmental protection laws that came into force in the early 1970s, at a time of real environmental activism and a time where there was a real concern that development had been running rampant, and buildings had been getting built in places that were dangerous potentially for the inhabitants or causing real harm to wildlife or habitat. The law itself is actually sort of ... on paper, seems very reasonable. It just asks developers of land to do a study, to basically look at their site before they build, and figure out what all of the environmental impacts are likely to be as a consequence of the specific structure that they plan to put there. The idea is that by documenting and disclosing these harms, there's a daylighting of the process that allows for local governments to decide if they want to ask for changes or for developers to make those changes. That process has evolved over the last half a century into a bit of a complex regulatory system that has been very much criticized by folks in the building industry, because while it both serves that very valuable disclosure process, it also takes a lot of time to go through a public process of vetting that reporting, and it provides both a hook where local governments have sometimes used it to functionally block development, even though that wasn't the purpose, and it is a way by which any citizen can litigate, they can file lawsuits saying that that environmental review wasn't properly done. So it has been blamed as providing a effective veto to any citizen who's able to file a lawsuit. Dana Taylor: After signing the two bills, Newsom called it \"the most consequential housing reform that we've seen in modern history in the state of California\". Let's talk about likely impacts. What are you hearing from developers, and how long will people have to wait to see new housing take shape? Ben Metcalf: Yeah, so let me clarify, first of all, that the rollback only applies to development that's happening for ... well, primarily for residential housing, so people building new homes, and only really in the context of infill locations. So these are locations that are part of the city that are adjacent to build sites that are themselves sites that were previously developed. So part of the logic here from an environmental standpoint is that although it's rolling back some environmental protections, it's actually making it easier to build in the places where we know the environmental impacts are going to be less, and in fact, I think it's sort of a little bit reflective of a growing awareness that in the 1970s a lot of our interest was on, for example, habitat protection. We were worried about impacts to specific animals, we're worried about pollution. I think today, our concern has evolved to be really about climate change, and when you think about development from a climate perspective, really the first and most important thing that you can do is reduce the vehicle miles traveled. The more the people are in their cars driving, the greater the carbon, the greater the climate impact. So if you want to actually have environmental benefit, you want to steer more development towards these infill locations that are going to be more likely to be in compact neighborhoods, closer to transit, closer to existing infrastructure. So there's a little bit of a bargain that's being done here where we're saying, \"Okay, we're willing to have more development.\" If we can help more development happen in these infill locations, we're willing to have a lower standard of concern for the environmental impacts that may happen on a site by site basis. Dana Taylor: Do we know how long it's going to take before some of the actual development begins for this housing? Ben Metcalf: So what we do know probably with the most certainty is that all cohort of projects that are now sort of in their, what's called pre-development stage, they haven't yet started construction, but they're trying to get the approvals they need to begin building. A whole cohort of projects in that stage are going to be able to move forward faster and sooner. So if a typical environmental impact review that you would otherwise have to do is going to take four or five or six months, sometimes it takes quite a bit more, then that amount of your timeline is going to fall out. So projects that were sort of already in flight are going to get pulled forward and be able to get in the ground sooner. So I think we have a pretty good certainty that there's going to be a timing benefit for all of these in-fill residential projects in California going forward. I think what's a little bit less certain is does this induce new projects to get into the ground to go into development that didn't previously pencil or didn't make financial sense. Dana Taylor: I'm going to circle back to this. As you said, one group that's very unhappy with Newsom's move is environmentalists. What are their biggest concerns today? Ben Metcalf: They are very worried that by not doing this process of creating an environmental review, that we just won't know what we don't know, that we won't know if development is going forward in a place that does have a sensitive habitat or will cause significant impacts to other environmental concerns, whether it's air quality, water quality, or animal habitat. Again, I think the opposition from the environmental groups has been less than might've been expected. I think it's actually quite a bit less than we would've seen five or 10 or 15 years ago. Again, I think it's partly because the environmental movement is increasingly moving away from a concern just on these site-based impacts and more towards this global concern around emissions, carbon, pollution, and I think generally there's a widespread understanding that residential development is going to happen in a place like California. People are going to keep having kids, there are going to be new jobs getting created, and so it's in the interest of environmentalists to be facilitative of housing happening in infill area. I think the devil's in the details, though, because while environmental groups generally agree they want to help facilitate infill housing, they're still going to be looking for more limitations, conditions. The bill already does require, for example, there has to be some environmental assessment that's done. The bill already did say this doesn't apply for areas that are in flood zones or other certain kinds of very specific fire hazard zones, for example. So I mean, there's a little bit of compromise that was made in this vision to, I think, defuse some of the opposition, but I think there's going to continue to be a negotiation review and possibly some future legislative amendments to this over the next year or two. Dana Taylor: How might Newsom's partial repeal kickstart the availability of affordable housing? Do the new laws address the need for more multi-family construction? Ben Metcalf: Well, the primary beneficiary of this will be multifamily housing. In these infill locations, multifamily does comprise a larger share of net new residential housing than single family. Both some single family and multifamily both can benefit, but in practice it'll be more multifamily, and what we do know about multifamily housing is that even when it's not formally subsidized or officially \"affordable\", it does just tend to get priced at more accessible price points and tends to be smaller units. So look, I think any sort of new supply is going to be helpful. California is way, way, way behind on its overall housing supply. Building permit numbers have been really down for the last 15 to 20 years. So any sort of new supply is going to be helpful, and I think this kind of supply, which tends to be multifamily, which has to be infill, is probably going to be the most helpful for addressing affordability crisis. Dana Taylor: California is not alone in its struggles to create more affordable housing. Are there lessons for the rest of the country to be learned from California here? Ben Metcalf: Historically, the focus on affordable housing has manifested itself as \"let's create new affordable housing programs\", like \"let's build new public housing or pay for vouchers or low income housing tax credits.\" I think what's interesting here is there's this awareness that part of the reason, maybe the primary reason that the affordability crisis has gotten so bad is a function simply of a lack of housing at all price points, that simply people have been unable to sort of make the math... Builders have been able to make the math pencil to build new housing of any kind, and so there's really an idea here that if we want to solve affordability, we have to spur more market rate and private housing. So it's interesting, particularly in a place like California. California has a democratic legislature, they have a democratic governor, and what we're seeing here is really like, \"Hey, a deregulatory thrust, let's actually get government out of the way a little bit so builders can build,\" and so I think that's interesting, because that's a little bit of a, hey, the Democrats in California maybe arguably attacking to the center. They're trying to say, \"Well, we can both focus on core liberal ideals and help with social safety nets, and also we want to make government work better and maybe get a little bit out of the way when we're achieving this kind of an important public policy purpose.\" So I think number one, it sort of signals like, hey, maybe there's a way to move more centrist, let's call it pro-business or pro-development kind of land use and supply reform laws to a place of California, and I think honestly, a lot of other states are watching what's happening right now in California. So if you're a governor in another state, particularly a democratic state that has long had a history of very strong environmental protections, I think you're looking at this and saying, \"Hey, I have an affordability crisis in my state. Should I also be revisiting some of the ways my environmental regulations have worked so that I can sort of have a both end? Both protect the environment, but also help get more housing built in the places where I know that the housing needs to go. Dana Taylor: Ben, some politicians are touting this as a solution to the housing crisis. Is that overblown, or will more legislation be needed to incentivize development? Ben Metcalf: I regret to say it's definitively overblown. I think this is a really important step. Like I said, I think it will absolutely speed up housing in California, which is really important. It will slightly lower costs and it will also reduce the uncertainty that comes from that sort of threat of litigation that I mentioned, but at the end of the day, it's still really expensive to build housing and really hard to build housing, and that has to do with a lot of factors that go well beyond this particular CEQA environmental policy. So until we can figure out ways to make it cheaper overall to build housing, until we can address issues like construction labor shortage, and incredible challenges with material pricing, and unless we can also figure out ways to achieve the life, safety and health benefits that we get from a very strong building code, it's still going to be very expensive to build that housing. So we have to figure out how to lower those. We also have to figure out how we can make sure that there are places where building is allowed, and particularly multifamily housing is allowed. Historically in California, there's been a very strong undercurrent of what's called NIMBYism. Not in my backyard. People saying, \"Hey, I don't want new housing in my neighborhood. It should go somewhere else.\" California has made some progress on that, but there's still more work that's needed to basically say to every city in town of California, we all sort of need to take our share of this growth and hopefully direct a lot of it into [inaudible 00:12:24] areas, and where that's not possible, make sure that it's happening and sort of compact, more accessible communities proximate to jobs and amenities. Dana Taylor: Finally, what's your biggest takeaway on the national crisis in affordable housing? Ben Metcalf: That this is a complicated one, but there's real dynamism right now, I think, coming from all sides of the political spectrum, to come up with real and meaningful fixes. So we have states like California that have Democrats controlling the legislature and the governorship, but we also have states like Montana, Utah, Arizona, which are Republican controlled, and we have exactly the same conversations going on, and exactly the same energy too. This is one of these rare issues that isn't super polarized where there really is a possibility for folks to work across the aisle and come up with creative solutions that involve both making it easier to get new housing built and coming up with some ways to really protect the most vulnerable residents who are really right now at real risk of homelessness or seeing their whole paychecks go into really substandard housing. So that's an opportunity, and I'm excited with things like what we saw in California to see where this momentum goes and see if it's augers, more of these sort of creative approaches to look at how we can have government work better.

        "domain": "newsweek.com",
        "text": "Published Jul 29, 2025 at 05:00 AM EDT U.S. News Reporter Universal or guaranteed basic income programs are gaining momentum across the country, as local governments and nonprofits experiment with the bold new alternative to traditional welfare models. According to Stanford University's Basic Income Lab, which tracks ongoing UBI or GBI pilot programs across the U.S., citizens in 18 states, as well as the District of Columbia, have taken part in some form of basic income study this year. \"UBI differs quite radically from welfare as we know it because it goes to all without means tests or work requirements,\" said Juliana Bidadanure, founder of the Basic Income Lab. \"It builds a robust floor that prevents all from falling too low, and it achieves that with a principle of radical inclusivity (everyone is opted in automatically).\" Neither UBI nor GBI programs have yet become a nationwide practice in any country, and their implementation will continue to be hindered by political and fiscal concerns some governments may have over providing citizens with unconditional payments. However, the studies that have been conducted have provided important data on the benefits and drawbacks of income guarantees for citizens, and could lead to further adoption in the future. Given that economies across the globe are faced with mounting inequality and the prospects of automation depriving millions of working opportunities, advocates believe that providing a basic income is an increasingly necessary means of ensuring financial security in the face of rapid economic shifts. According to the Stanford Basic Income Lab's tracker, 57 basic income experiments were ongoing as of late January, with over a dozen in California alone. While many have concluded, others remain ongoing, varying in payment amounts, recipients and intended purposes. One such experiment is currently being conducted by the Southern California non-profit Inland SoCal United Way in conjunction with the California Department of Social Services. The pilot program will provide unconditional cash payments of $600 per month for 18 months to hundreds of pregnant women in their first or second trimesters, as well as $750 per month to 21-year-olds who have spent time in the foster care system. Another is the Richmond Resilience Initiative, operated by the city's government and now in its fifth year, which focuses on providing support to those who serve as their household's primary caregiver. Participants receive $500 per month for a period of two years, and it is aimed at \"reducing financial instability for working families.\" Canadian health economist and basic income scholar Evelyn Forget told Newsweek that current welfare programs are plagued with bureaucratic obstacles and inefficiencies, issues she believes are made easier by an unconditional payment system like UBI. \"In North America, we have a range of social programs — most underfunded and virtually all 'conditional,'\" she said. \"These conditions, on their face, seem reasonable... In practice, many of these conditions are imposed in ways that make access to cash difficult: How do you 'prove' residency when you have no ID? How do you 'prove' an episodic mental illness? How do you access child support when you're the grandmother caring for the kids but their parents, who may be unreachable, have custody?\" Amy Castro, co-founder of the Center for Guaranteed Income Research at the University of Pennsylvania, said that the heightened interest in unconditional cash programs has been driven by \"pervasive economic strain.\" \"Americans are working more and making less to the detriment of our health, well-being, and relationships,\" she said. \"Living with chronic financial stress like not knowing if you will receive enough shifts at work to make rent drives poor public health outcomes, food insecurity and a range of mental health stressors.\" Castro added that the benefit of such programs is that cash \"is provided with no strings attached, no conditions on how the money can be spent,\" and that this can work alongside existing social safety nets. Based on data from over 30 basic income pilots across the U.S., the Stanford Basic Income Lab tracked how Americans spent the money they received through these programs. The majority of expenditures went toward retail sales and services. Food and groceries were the second-highest at 32 percent, followed by transport and housing/utilities, both at 9 percent. Juliana Bidadanure, founder of the Stanford Basic Income Lab, told Newsweek that a system of simple, unconditional payments \"suppresses bureaucratically burdensome eligibility tests and protects individuals in poverty from being subject to the discretionary power of state agents. It implements a real right to live free from abject poverty, no questions asked, no paperwork filed.\" \"The universal feature of UBI also makes it harder to demonize or stigmatize those on benefits,\" she added. \"This is important since a common feature of Western countries with targeted cash payment has been the stigmatization of benefits recipients as scroungers and welfare queens.\" Danny Avula, Mayor of Richmond, Virginia, upon launching the fifth Resilience Initiative basic income pilot, said: \"In Richmond, we believe everyone has a right to thrive, not just survive. The Richmond Resilience Initiative reflects our ongoing commitment to creating a city where families have the stability and support they need to build a better future.\" Amy Castro, co-founder of the Center for Guaranteed Income Research, told Newsweek: \"The advantage of cash is that it is flexible, fungible, and efficient—particularly when enduring an unexpected economic shock like a natural disaster or sudden drop in the market. Traditional safety net benefits like WIC, SNAP or housing supports require constant administrative recertification and are plagued by the benefits cliff where working families are penalized for every dollar they make above the income threshold.\" \"People spend tremendous amounts of time and cognitive bandwidth negotiating these cliffs to make sure they don't lose benefits crucial for surviving a risky economy,\" she added. \"This traps people at the poverty line because they must choose between a raise at work or an extra shift and potentially losing their benefits.\" © 2025 Newsweek Digital LLC",

        "text": "ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. Social Security is in the process of morphing into “universal basic income” (UBI). The previous statement isn’t an endorsement of UBI, as much as it’s a prediction about what’s going to happen. Is this a good development? The view here is that it’s a bad one, and not because people will cease working.  Instead, surging technological advance means the Americans of tomorrow will work more than ever precisely because they’ll want to do much of the time what showcases their unique skills and intelligence. As pointed out with great regularity in my 2018 book The End of Work, there are no lazy people and there are no stupid people. But there is a relative lack of economic growth that suffocates individual genius such that people appear lazy and stupid. Watch stupidity and laziness (my much better working title for The End of Work was The End of Laziness) rapidly disappear as technological advance erases so much of what people used to do for a living in favor of living for work.  Which means that just as Americans in ever greater numbers happen on work that they can’t not do, they’ll suddenly find themselves “beneficiaries” of ever more government handouts that they don’t need or want. More than most will admit, government checks are a sad effect of prosperity as governments take in a great deal more in the way of taxed wealth that enables a great deal more borrowing by those same governments. All of this will be discussed in my next book, The Deficit Delusion.  Until then, watch as ever more prosperous Americans live longer as medical advances and happiness on the job elongate lives defined by work precisely because it doesn’t feel like work. Consider the latter through the prism of self-proclaimed budget experts claiming Social Security is set to go insolvent within the next ten years. Don’t bet on it. And the reason to not bet on it has to do with the fact that the so-called Social Security “lockbox” was always a myth, and because it’s always been a myth, it’s always been empty.  The above truth will free politicians to make the funding of Social Security all about general revenues. And general tax revenues are set to soar as work increasingly reflects our unique skills and intelligence. Which is yet more evidence that deficits will soar not due to a lack of government revenues or too much government spending (both analyses were always simplistic), but because our federal government is sadly poised to take in exponentially more tax revenue in the future. Translated, the deficits and debt have always been a logical effect of too much tax revenue in the present and the expectation of much more in the future.  Which is why the view here is that UBI is a really bad idea. It is because it’s a signal of ever more prosperous people ignoring the growth of government that’s an effect of their wealth. This isn’t a call to shrink wealth, rather it’s a call to massively shrink the federal government’s tax share of wealth that’s set to multiply.  The amount is way too sizable, which is why Social Security looms as a backdoor path to UBI. A federal government with way too much money will no longer be constrained by Social Security withholdings, and will instead just fund what’s never made sense with endless tax revenue borne of people working all the time even when they’re not working. UBI will unfortunately reveal its monumentally dense head at a time when no one needs it.",

        "text": "Opinion January 6, 2023 5 min read The U.S. Could Help Solve Its Poverty Problem with a Universal Basic Income A universal basic income wouldn’t lead to adults leaving their jobs and could lift millions of children into a brighter future By Michael W. Howard  Thomas Fuchs When the child tax credit, first established in 1997, was expanded for a year in 2021, it was a major political and social win for the country. At a time when the pandemic had worsened many families’ financial distress, the Biden administration’s decision not only added to the amount of the tax credit and converted the payment from a year-end lump sum to monthly payments; it also abandoned the work requirement for parents. This immediately affected one third of all children in the U.S., including 52 percent of Black children and 41 percent of Hispanic children, whose families were formerly excluded because the parents earned too little to qualify for the tax credit. The tax credit expansion lifted 3.7 million children out of poverty by December 2021 without significantly reducing parents’ work participation. Then in January 2022, the expanded tax credit expired, which plunged 3.7 million back into poverty, with higher percentage increases in poverty among Hispanic and Black children. The credit showed us that cash assistance could help families stay afloat and, contrary to some political beliefs, parents would not leave the labor system because of it. Even so, the failure to renew the expansion should not negate this important political milestone: Congress came within one vote of abandoning parental work requirements as a condition to get cash assistance for their families. The child tax credit expansion is one step toward a universal basic income that could eliminate poverty without increasing unemployment. There are 37.9 million people in poverty in the U.S., according to 2021 Census Bureau figures. Providing a government-funded monthly payment to every individual would broadly lift them out of poverty, while providing millions of children a better chance at a good education, improved health and higher future earnings. With 11.6 percent of people in the U.S. living at or under the poverty line, this payment would benefit millions and save hundreds of billions of dollars by reducing the social costs of poverty. The question becomes: Can we convince our elected officials that poverty is not a moral failing, but a social condition that can be addressed by establishing an income floor below which no one falls?

A universal basic income, or UBI, is defined as “a periodic cash payment unconditionally delivered to all on an individual basis, without means-test or work requirement,” according to the Basic Income Earth Network. The child tax credit isn’t quite the same, because it is only for families with children; it also phases out at higher income levels and essentially still forces people to prove they are “poor enough” to need help—a means test. A more ambitious bill approaching the idea of UBI introduced by Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Mondaire Jones, would eliminate the means test, thereby creating a universal child allowance. Universal benefits have several advantages over means-tested benefits. They avoid divisions between “us” and “them,” removing the stigma associated with targeted benefits. Uptake by the needy, a persistent problem with targeted benefits, is improved when stigma and bureaucratic hurdles are removed. Universal benefits tend to be more popular and hence are more politically secure and better funded. And universal benefits, dispensing with means testing, are easier to administer. The universal child allowance would enroll all children at birth so no child would be excluded. No country has yet introduced a universal basic income sufficient for essential needs. But in the U.S., Alaska has enacted its Permanent Fund Dividend, which is an annual cash payment, averaging around $1,600, that goes to every resident without means test or work requirement. It contributes to poverty reduction and has no negative effect on people’s willingness to work. In the U.S., a universal child allowance and Social Security for seniors would mean that the two most vulnerable age groups in our population would have near-universal and unconditional income guaranteed. But of course, extending a basic income to the remaining adults faces serious hurdles. First, no one expects children under the age of 18 to work, and keeping them in poverty is costly for everyone; according to one estimate, social benefits outweigh fiscal costs of universal child allowance by 8 to 1. But there is a widely held expectation that able-bodied adults should work for their income. Empirical evidence from the means-tested minimum income experiments of the 1970s in the U.S. and recent analysis of a similar experiment in Manitoba, among other research, support the idea that few people actually stop working when they are simultaneously receiving a guaranteed income. Such research also shows that those who stop working for wages do so for good reasons, such as finishing high school or taking care of young children, and that a modest guaranteed minimum income can enable people to work who otherwise could not. Even if a few people would take the cash without contributing to society, the benefits may substantially outweigh the costs. The norm that every abled person receiving cash payments should be seeking a job can also be challenged. First, holding a job is not the only form of work. Taking care of children and elders is work—work that is performed mostly by women without compensation. A basic income is a way of supporting and recognizing that work without intrusive state monitoring and reinforcement of gendered division of labor. Second, research by Belgian political theorists Philippe Van Parijs and Yannick Vanderborght reveals that a significant part of individual income, or the lack of income, results not from labor but rather from luck. This is obvious in the case of income from inherited wealth, but no less true of income connected to jobs in capital-intensive industries or income involving inherited knowledge and technology. On the negative side, many people with unrecognized disabilities fall between the cracks of targeted cash transfer systems. A basic income is one way to equalize such morally arbitrary luck. Universal basic income does not give people something for nothing so much as equalize everyone’s share of the luck. Fair giving and taking would then take place on the basis of a more equitable starting place. In addition to the belief that people will quit their jobs under a basic income, the idea faces another hurdle: apparent cost. A basic income of $1,000/month for every person in the U.S. would have a gross cost of about $4 trillion a year. A means-tested minimum income guarantee, which phases out as earned income increases above a threshold, could raise incomes by the same amount for perhaps one sixth of the gross cost of a basic income. However, the net cost to the taxpayers is no greater for basic income than for a means-tested minimum income, because the higher taxes some will pay are offset by the basic income they receive. To the extent that the mere fact of “churning”—money going out to everyone, only to be taken back in taxes from some—is an obstacle to political support, the means-tested guaranteed income may be the more politically feasible policy, but it would lose some of the advantages of universal programs. In the meantime, if a truly universal child allowance is eventually adopted, that could tip the scale in favor of a basic income further down the road.

Tubbs, 33, was born to a teenage mother, whom he says he never saw when he was younger because ‚Äúshe was always working ‚Äî and it was never enough.‚Äù\n     \n            His own experiences led him to think about different ways that the wealthiest country in the world could help ameliorate poverty. When Tubbs went on to become the first Black mayor of his hometown in 2016, he spearheaded a guaranteed income pilot program in 2019 that did something simple yet radical: Give out free money with no strings attached.¬†\n \n            That idea of guaranteed income is receiving renewed interest as AI becomes an increasing threat to Americans‚Äô livelihoods.\n     \nRelated article\n‚ÄòJobs may disappear‚Äô: Nearly 40% of global employment could be disrupted by AI, IMF says\n \n            Global policymakers and business leaders are now increasingly warning that the rise of artificial intelligence¬†will likely have profound impacts on the labor market and could put millions of people out of work in the years ahead (while also creating new and different jobs in the process). The International Monetary Fund warned earlier this year that some 40% of jobs around the world could be affected by the rise of AI, and that this trend will likely deepen the already cavernous gulf between the haves¬†and have-nots.\n     \n            As more Americans‚Äô jobs are increasingly at risk due to the threat of AI, Tubbs and other proponents of guaranteed income say this could be one solution to help provide a safety net and cushion the expected blow AI will have on the labor market.\n     \n            ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt really do a good job at designing policies or doing things in times of crisis,‚Äù Tubbs told CNN, saying it is urgent to start planning for guaranteed income programs before we see 40% of global jobs taken by AI.\n     \n            For a period of two years starting in 2019, Stockton handed out¬†to¬†125 randomly selected residents in low-income neighborhoods $500 a month with no conditions around how they used the funds¬†or if they had employment. The initial results from the pilot program found that recipients had drastically improved their job prospects and financial stability and saw better physical and mental health outcomes.\n     \n            ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get the guardrails in place now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThen, when we have to deal with that job displacement, we‚Äôre better positioned to do so.‚Äù\n     \n            The idea of a guaranteed income is not new. Tubbs said he was inspired to pursue it after reading the works of Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., who advocated for guaranteed income in his 1967 book, ‚ÄúWhere Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?‚Äù\n     \n            ‚ÄúI‚Äôm now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective ‚Äî the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income,‚Äù King wrote at the time.\n     \n            Decades after King‚Äôs death, the idea of guaranteed income went on to see a resurgence of support emanating out of Silicon Valley. The concept emerged as a buzzword of sorts among many of Silicon Valley‚Äôs elite ‚Äî including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman ‚Äî even before the public launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 re-upped a global debate about automation disrupting jobs.\n     \n            ‚ÄúUniversal income will be necessary over time if AI takes over most human jobs,‚Äù Tesla CEO Musk tweeted back in 2018. Late last year, in an interview with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Musk said he thought AI would eventually bring about ‚Äúuniversal high income,‚Äù without sharing any details of what this could look like.\n     \nRelated article\nProject that gave $500 a month to some California residents shows that such efforts could have a ‚Äòprofound impact on public health, researchers say\n \n            Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, called for the exploration of ‚Äúideas like universal basic income to make sure that everyone has a cushion to try new ideas,‚Äù during a Harvard commencement speech in May 2017. In a Facebook post later that year, Zuckerberg celebrated Alaska‚Äôs Permanent Fund Dividend ‚Äî or the annual grants given to Alaska residents from a portion of the state‚Äôs oil revenue ‚Äî as a ‚Äúnovel approach to basic income‚Äù that ‚Äúcomes from conservative principles of smaller government, rather than progressive principles of a larger safety net.‚Äù\n     \n            Altman, CEO of one of the world‚Äôs most powerful AI companies, OpenAI, has also been outspoken about what he sees as the need for some form of guaranteed income as many jobs are increasingly lost to automation.\n     \n            Back in 2016, when Altman was president of tech startup accelerator YCombinator, he announced he was seeking participants to help launch a study on basic income (or, as he described it at the time, ‚Äúgiving people enough money to live on with no strings attached.‚Äù)\n     \n            ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fairly confident that at some point in the future, as technology continues to eliminate traditional jobs and massive new wealth gets created, we‚Äôre going to see some version of this at a national scale,‚Äù Altman wrote in a 2016 blog post for YCombinator.\n     \n            He has since left his post at YCombinator to focus on OpenAI, but Altman still chairs the board of OpenResearch, the nonprofit lab that is in the process of conducting this ongoing study on basic income that he helped launch.\n     \n            Elizabeth Rhodes, research director at OpenResearch, told CNN earlier this year that it hopes to release initial findings this summer from a three-year study on unconditional income involving some 3,000 individuals in two states.\n     \n            ‚ÄúWe really see this as sort of a foundational exploratory study to understand what happens when you give individuals unconditional cash,‚Äù she told CNN.\n     \n            While she stressed that she could not get into the specifics of her team‚Äôs research while the study is underway, she hopes that their findings can eventually provide some data that answers some of the most common questions surrounding how cash payments will impact people‚Äôs desire to work and its broader potential advantages or disadvantages within communities.\n     \n            Other tech industry tycoons, including Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, have also thrown immense financial support behind guaranteed income programs. (In 2020, Dorsey donated some $18 million to Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, the organization that Tubbs founded).\n     \n            Dozens of cities across the United States have already begun experimenting with guaranteed income programs in recent years, with most of them funded by nonprofit organizations but organized by local officials.\n     \n            Tubbs said he ultimately thinks funding for these programs should come from the federal government but encouraged lawmakers to be creative about finding ways to raise revenue.\n     \n            ‚ÄúFor example, you could legalize cannabis federally and use that tax revenue, you could do a data dividend or some sort of robot tax or AI tax,‚Äù he suggested.\n     \n            Opponents to guaranteed income programs, most of whom lean Republican, have argued that such efforts disincentivize work or that taxing successful tech companies can stifle innovation.\n     \n            And in Texas, opponents of guaranteed income are taking their battle to court. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Harris County over its guaranteed income program that is funded using federal money from the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan. ‚ÄúThis scheme is plainly unconstitutional,‚Äù Paxton said in a statement. ‚ÄúI am suing to stop officials in Harris County from abusing public funds for political gain.‚Äù\n     \n            In court documents, the attorney general goes on to slam the program as ‚Äúillegal and illegitimate government overreach.‚Äù\n     \n            Tomas Vargas Jr., a recipient of guaranteed income in the Stockton pilot program, told CNN that he heard critics saying that receiving the extra payments would make people ‚Äúlazy.‚Äù But he says it ultimately gave him the opportunity to find better work.\n     \n            ‚ÄúWhen I got the money, I was already in the mindset of hustling and getting money. So, it just made me want to get more money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe thing that I want people to understand about the guaranteed income is it‚Äôs not just giving people money, it‚Äôs giving them opportunity.‚Äù\n     \n            For years, Vargas said he woke up every day with the crippling anxiety that comes with never quite knowing how he will be able to provide for his family. He was juggling multiple jobs: working at UPS, repairing cars, mowing lawns, delivering groceries and picking up any other work he could find. He said he almost never saw his children and said he briefly received food stamp assistance but was ‚Äúinstantly kicked off‚Äù when he would pick up extra hours of work.\n     \n            ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one thing that I‚Äôve always wanted as a father, and that‚Äôs not to make my kids go through the same things that I went through: having no power, no water, or no food on the plates,‚Äù he told CNN. ‚ÄúSo I was always trying to grind.‚Äù\n     \n            Vargas said the extra cash payments he received helped him focus and apply for one full-time job, which he never had the time or energy to do before. He now says he thinks guaranteed income could be one way to provide a cushion for re-training or education programs for people whose jobs are exposed to AI, the same way it helped him pivot to better and more secure employment.\n     \n            Vargas, like Tubbs, was born and raised in Stockton. Vargas said his father was never around much growing up and he eventually moved in with his grandmother when he was 12. Before participating in the program, Vargas said he was ‚Äúa really negative person‚Äù and that he didn‚Äôt look at himself as someone even worth investing in.\n     \n            But the extra financial security allowed him to spend more time with his children, and ultimately break the cycle of poverty he had seen in his community his whole life.\n     \n            ‚ÄúOne of the biggest things that helped me realize my full potential that I had in myself, and I was worth investing in, was seeing the reaction from my kids,‚Äù Vargas said, ‚Äúand seeing the generational trauma and healing in them.‚Äù\n     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

He says Cook County's basic income program has let him provide more for his kids. Christopher Santiago recalls being skeptical the first time he heard about basic income — giving people cash with no conditions on how to spend it. It was 2020, when presidential candidate Andrew Yang pitched it for all American adults, and Santiago thought, \"That doesn't make much sense.\"  But for a year now, Santiago has been getting $500 a month through one of the largest cash aid pilots in the U.S., and he's come around. The single dad of three lives in Alsip, Ill., and was one of a whopping 233,000 people who applied for the program in Cook County, which includes Chicago.  (There was a lottery to pick the 3,250 participants.) As a public employee, his income is toward the upper end of the program cutoff, but he says it hardly feels like enough for a family of four. Snuggling on the couch next to his youngest daughter, 9-year-old Calliope, he says the extra cash has helped him manage skyrocketing prices for everything. And it's let him provide more for his children, including ballet classes, a birthday visit to Disney on Ice, and family trips. \"It's a hard thing to have to tell a child, 'No,' \" he says. \"It kind of kills you a little bit.\" Santiago was also able to avoid a mini-emergency when right after a weekend trip, his furnace broke. \"It was a $700 part and I was just like, 'Oh God, this would have sunk me.' \" Cash aid without conditions was considered a radical idea before the pandemic. But early results from a program in Stockton, Calif., showed promise. Then interest exploded after it became clear how much COVID stimulus checks and emergency rental payments had helped people. The U.S. Census Bureau found that an expanded child tax credit cut child poverty in half. That is, until the expansion ended and child poverty spiked. Around the country, from big cities to rural counties, there've been more than 150 basic income pilots, and counting. Supporters say it works because people can spend the money on whatever they need most. \"They can pursue education for themselves and their children,\" says Toni Preckwinkle, president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. \"They can invest in their families in ways that makes them more productive and more stable over time.\" \n                Toni Preckwinkle, president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, says she hopes to prove basic income works so that it could someday go nationwide.\n                \n                    \n                    Taylor Glascock for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Toni Preckwinkle, president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, says she hopes to prove basic income works so that it could someday go nationwide. The idea is not new. Preckwinkle notes that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Black Panthers called for guaranteed income. So, briefly, did President Richard Nixon. These days, some tech entrepreneurs argue that cash aid will be needed as gig work, automation and AI threaten jobs.  Preckwinkle thinks cash aid should be a permanent part of the social safety net. And she wants to prove it works, so it could someday go nationwide.  \"The federal government is really the only entity that has the resources to do this on the mass scale that it needs to be done,\" she says. The pandemic also spurred cash aid because cities got their own pot of COVID relief money. Many are using that to fund guaranteed income pilots. Philanthropic donations are another major funding source, including from groups that have long organized direct cash payments to combat poverty in developing nations.  The pilots target low- to moderate-income people, from a few hundred to a few thousand households, and generally pay them $500 or $1,000 a month for a year or two. When Cook County's two-year pilot ends, Preckwinkle has vowed to use the county's own budget to keep it going. A few states have also allocated funding to cash aid programs. But as pandemic money runs out, it's possible this mass experiment could fizzle.  \"That's a concern, and that's what we are pushing back against,\" says Natalie Foster, president of the Economic Security Project, which advocates for guaranteed income. She founded the group along with Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook. Foster says the U.S. has more poverty than almost any other rich nation and that its social safety net is one of the stingiest. \"If you look at so many other countries with similar economies, you understand that college is free,\" Foster says. \"They ensure that health care is cheap and affordable. Oftentimes, child care is free. That is the type of life we could offer Americans and choose not to.\" The problem hit home for Ameya Pawar with a trip to his local pharmacy. He's now a senior adviser with the Economic Security Project in Chicago. But in 2016, he was a new dad who was sent to get diapers and was puzzled to find them and other baby products under lock and key. \n                Ameya Pawar is a senior adviser with the Economic Security Project in Chicago. He says cash can help people buy things as simple as diapers and wipes, which are not covered by the existing U.S. social safety net.\n                \n                    \n                    Taylor Glascock for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Ameya Pawar is a senior adviser with the Economic Security Project in Chicago. He says cash can help people buy things as simple as diapers and wipes, which are not covered by the existing U.S. social safety net. He came to realize that people are not allowed to use public assistance to buy diapers or wipes, and saw the locks as a heartbreaking sign of their desperation.  Because \"you need to send your infant with diapers or wipes to attend child care, so you can go to work,\" he says. Pawar and others point to welfare reform in the 1990s, which dramatically reduced the amount of cash assistance. For the poorest families, that lack of cash can make it hard to pay for things like utilities, transportation to a job, enough food for a full month or school supplies for children. This is partly why advocates for basic income say it's not meant to replace other assistance, but to add to it.  TaylorRaquel Adams says the $500 she gets each month from the Cook County pilot is a blessing, even if she's \"still in poverty.\" She works an overnight shift at an Amazon plant — 3:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. — in the department where things get returned. \"I'm inspecting it to see if we can resell it, if it needs to be refurbished, or if it's salvage,\" she says. Adams is 42, single and has no children. She's worked since she was 15 and would love to work full time again. But she says it would be tough, given that she suffers PTSD from childhood trauma and has schizoaffective disorder.   Adams gets disability income, a housing subsidy and food aid. And still, despite her conscientious budgeting, the extra cash basically helps her make ends meet. \"I'm hoping in the next couple of months I get some savings,\" she says.   Much of the money has gone for medical expenses. Adams' Medicare plan does not cover dental or vision, and she needs to spend $500 more a month for that.  Two years ago, she was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, and the supplements and vitamins her doctor recommends can mean spending hundreds of dollars some months.  The cash aid also let her buy Christmas presents last year for the first time in a while. And it allowed her to splurge on a pedicure for her birthday — what she calls \"pamper-me time.\" One month's payment went for a pricey repair on her Chevy Spark, an enormous help given her nearly hourlong commute to Amazon.  \"You need income to work,\" she says. \"There's only so many jobs in my area that's within walking distance.\" \n                Matt Harvey, 25, recently started working at a Chicago nonprofit called Equity and Transformation. He says extra cash from Cook County's basic income pilot program helps him and his partner pay for day care for their 2-year-old son.\n                \n                    \n                    Taylor Glascock for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Matt Harvey, 25, recently started working at a Chicago nonprofit called Equity and Transformation. He says extra cash from Cook County's basic income pilot program helps him and his partner pay for day care for their 2-year-old son. For Matt Harvey, the extra monthly income has made it far easier for him to work full time.  Harvey is 25 and was unemployed when he applied for Cook County's basic income pilot. He and his girlfriend lived separately at the time, but he did most of the parenting for their toddler son while she worked.  After they moved in together, they used the extra money for groceries and household items. Harvey says the payments lowered his stress and made him \"feel more like I'm contributing.\" He tried to ramp up side gigs as a driver for Uber and Amazon Flex.  But he says it was always a calculation over whether the money he made from those hours was worth the cost of day care, \"because the day care is expensive.\"  Then Harvey got a full-time job in research and communications at a nonprofit. It meant his son would have to be in child care full time at a cost that felt out of reach: $2,000 a month.  \"We were only able to put him in day care because of the extra $500,\" he says. Their rent is going up again this year. And though Harvey didn't finish college, he still owes about $20,000 in student debt. Still, he feels they're in better shape with his new job. And they're planning ahead so they can be prepared for when the extra monthly payments stop.  Guaranteed income programs specifically do not require people to work. That's a selling point for supporters, who say the extra cash can create the time and space to find a better job or perhaps a new direction.   But the lack of any work requirement is a main concern for opponents, especially if no-strings cash aid were to be made permanent. \"My fear is that we would see earnings and hours and work decrease amongst low income Americans,\" says Leslie Ford, with the conservative American Enterprise Institute.  She agrees the U.S. social safety net needs to change but says work should remain at the heart of it.  \"Ultimately, if we want this person to become self-sufficient, if we want the outcome of our safety net to not merely be subsistence, work is a key aspect of flourishing long term,\" Ford says.  So far, with one- to two-year cash aid pilots, researchers say there's been no significant impact on whether people have jobs. Some parents, though, have cut back on gig work to spend more time with their children.   Researchers also reject the stigma that poor people can't be trusted with free money. \n                Calliope Santiago with her cat, Pixel.

Among other things, her dad has used extra cash payments to pay for her ballet classes and family trips. \"They spend the money in ways that everyone does,\" says Stacia West with the University of Tennessee, and a co-founder of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Guaranteed Income Research. \"Going to the grocery store, making sure the rent is paid, paying the car note.\" She and her co-researcher Amy Castro have published peer-reviewed research on several cash aid pilots, including in Stockton, Calif., and are following others around the country. They find that — no surprise — the extra income makes people more financially stable. After about six months of payments, they also start to see \"little glimmers of changes in a person's psychology,\" says West. \"We see increases in a person's psychological well-being, so a reduction in psychological distress.\"  They also find the changes fade within months after the money stops, as more households report they would not have $400 for an emergency.  Castro says public momentum on basic income is moving faster than the data, and there are still many open questions.   \"How long do people need to be receiving cash in order to create change? And how do we put that into policy in such a way that it actually makes sense?\" she asks. \"These programs are expensive. People should be asking those questions.\" Castro, West and others are racing to find answers, as more and more places turn to direct cash payments to help struggling Americans.

        "text": "On December 15, 2017, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, issued a damning report on his visit to the United States. He cited data from the Stanford Center on Inequality and Poverty, which reports that “in terms of labor markets, poverty, safety net, wealth inequality, and economic mobility, the US comes in last of the top 10 most well-off countries, and 18th amongst the top 21.” Alston wrote that “the American Dream is rapidly becoming the American Illusion, as the US now has the lowest rate of social mobility of any of the rich countries.” Just a few days before, on December 11, The Boston Globe's Spotlight team ran a story showing that the median net worth of nonimmigrant African American households in the Boston area is $8, in contrast to the $247,500 net worth for white households in the Boston area. Clearly income disparity is ripping the nation apart, and none of the efforts or programs seeking to address it seems to be working. I myself have been, for the past couple of years, engaged in a broad discussion about the future of work with some thoughtful tech leaders and representatives of the Catholic Church who have similar concerns, and the notion of a universal basic income (UBI) keeps coming up. Like many of my friends who fiddle with ideas about the future of work, I’ve avoided actually having a firm opinion about UBI for years. Now I have decided it’s time to get my head around it. Touted as an elegant solution to the problem of poverty in America and the impending decimation of jobs by automation, UBI is a hot topic today in the “salons” hosted by tech and hedge-fund billionaires. The idea of UBI in fact is an old idea, older than me even: Either through direct cash payments or some sort of negative income tax, we should support people in need—or even everyone—to increase well-being and lift society overall. Interestingly, this notion has had broad support from conservatives like Milton Friedman and progressives such as Martin Luther King Jr. On the other hand, UBI also has been criticized by conservatives as well as liberals. Conservative proponents of UBI argue that it could shrink a huge array of costly social welfare services like health care, food assistance, and unemployment support by providing a simple, inexpensive way to let individuals, rather than the government, decide what to spend the money on. Liberals see it as a way to redistribute wealth and empower groups like stay-at-home parents, whose work doesn’t produce income—making them ineligible for unemployment benefits. In addition, these UBI advocates see it as a way to eliminate poverty. Nevertheless, just as many conservatives and liberals don’t like the concept. Conservatives against UBI worry that it will decrease incentives to work and cost too much, racking up a bill that those who do work will have to pay. Skeptical liberals worry that employers will use it as an excuse to pay even lower wages. They also fear politicians will offer it as a rationale to gut existing social programs and unwind institutions that help those most in need. The result is that UBI is a partisan issue that, paradoxically, has bipartisan support. I was on a panel at a recent conference when the moderator asked audience and panel members what they thought of UBI. The overwhelming consensus of the 500 or so people in the room appeared to be “we're skeptical, but should experiment.” UBI sounds like a good or not-so-good idea to different constituents because we have so little understanding of either how we would do it, or how people would react. None of us really knows what we’re talking about when it comes to UBI, akin to being in a drunken bar argument before there were smartphones and Wikipedia. But there are a few basic principles and pieces of research that can help. Much of the resurgent interest in UBI has come from Silicon Valley. Tech titans and the academics around them are concerned that the robots and artificial intelligence they’ve built will rapidly displace humans in the workforce, or at least push them into dead-end jobs. Some researchers say robots will replace the low-paying jobs people don’t want, while others maintain people will end up getting the worst jobs not worthy of robots. UBI may play a role in which scenario comes to pass. Last year, Elon Musk told the National Governors Association that job disruption caused by technology was “the scariest problem to me,” admitting that he had no easy solution. Musk and other entrepreneurs see UBI as way to provide a cushion and a buffer to give humans time to retrain themselves to do what robots can’t do. Some believe that it might even spawn a new wave of entrepreneurs, giving those displaced workers a shot at the American Dream. They may be getting ahead of themselves. Luke Martinelli, a researcher at the University of Bath Institute for Policy Research, has written that “an affordable UBI is inadequate, and an adequate UBI is unaffordable.” I believe that is roughly true. One of the biggest problems with UBI is that a base sum that would allow people to refuse work and look for something better (rather than just allowing employers to pay workers less) is around $1000 per month, which would cost most countries somewhere between 5 percent to 35 percent of their GDP. That looks expensive compared with the cost to any developed country of eradicating poverty, so the only way a nation could support this kind of UBI would be to eliminate all funding for social programs. That would be applauded by libertarians and some conservatives, but not by many others. Underpinning the Silicon Valley argument for UBI is the belief in exponential growth powered by science and technology, as described by Peter Diamandis in his book Abundance: The Future is Better Than You Think. Diamandis contends that technological progress, including gains in health, the power of computing, and the development of machine intelligence, among other things, will lead to a kind of technological transcendence that makes today’s society look like how we view the Dark Ages. He argues that the human mind is unable to intuitively grasp this idea, and so we constantly underestimate long-term effects. If you plot progress out a few decades, Diamandis writes, we end up with unimaginable abundance: “We will soon have the ability to meet and exceed the basic needs of every man, woman, and child on the planet. Abundance for all is within our grasp.” (Technologists often forget is that we actually already have enough food to feed the world; the problem is that it’s just not properly distributed.) Many tech billionaires think they can have their cake and eat it too, that they are so rich and smart the trickle-down theory can lift the poor out of poverty without anyone or anything suffering. And why shouldn’t they think so? Their companies and their wealth have grown exponentially, and it doesn’t appear as though there is any end in sight, as Marc Andreessen prophetically predicted in his famous essay, “Why Software is Eating the World.” Most of Silicon Valley’s leaders gained their wealth in an exponentially growing market without having to engage in the aggressive tactics that marked the creation of wealth in the past. They feel their businesses inherently “do good,” and that, I believe, allows them to feel more charitable, broadly speaking. If the technologists are correct and automation is going to substantially increase US GDP, then who better to figure out what to do about the associated problems than the technologists themselves—or so their thinking goes. Tech leaders are underwriting experiments and financing research on UBI to prepare for a future that will allow them and their companies to continue in ascendance while keeping society stable. (Various localities and organizations already have experimented with forms of UBI over the years. In some cases, they have produced evidence that people receiving UBI do in fact continue to work, and that UBI gives people the ability to quit lousy jobs and look for better ones, or complete or go back to school.) Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator, has a project to give people free money and see what happens to them over time, for instance. Altman's experiment, prosaically named the Basic Income Project, will involve 3,000 people in two states over five years. Some 1,000 of them will be given $1,000 a month, and the rest will get just $50 a month and serve as a sort of control group. It should reveal some important information about how people will behave when given free money, providing an evidence-based way to think about UBI—we don’t have much of that evidence now. Among the questions hopefully to be answered: Will people use the cushion of free money to look for better work? Will they go back to school for retraining? Will neurological development of children improve? Will crime rates go down? As with many ideas with diverse support at high levels, the particulars of execution can make or break UBI in practice. Take the recent, much heralded UBI experiment in Finland. A Finnish welfare agency, Kela, and a group of researchers proposed paying between 550 and 700 euros a month to both workers and nonworkers around that country. Finland’s conservative government then began tweaking the proposal, most importantly eliminating the part of the plan that paid people who had jobs, and only providing UBI for those receiving unemployment benefits instead. It had no interest in whether UBI would allow people to look for better jobs or to train themselves for the jobs of the future. The government declared that the “primary goal of the basic income experiment is related to promoting employment.” And so what started as a credible experiment in empowering labor and liberal values became a conservative program to get more people to go back to crappy jobs—and a great warning about the impact that politics can have on efforts to test or deploy UBI. (We must wait until 2019 to see the full extent of the outcome.) Chris Hughes, a cofounder of Facebook and not-quite-billionaire, is the person I found with a plan for UBI that’s halfway between Silicon Valley’s techno-utopian vision and the vision held by the liberal East Coast types that I mostly hang out with these days. His new book Fair Shot: Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn outlines his views on UBI, but here’s my brief version of what Hughes is thinking: He believes we can do UBI now. He says we can “provide every single American stability through cash” by providing a monthly $500 supplement to lower-middle income taxpayers through the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC. He would expand EITC to include child care, elder care, and education as types of work that would be eligible for EITC. (Currently if the jobs are unpaid jobs, they are not eligible.) Hughes contends that this would cut poverty in America by half. According to his numbers, right now the EITC costs the US $70 billion a year, and his UBI proposal would tack on an additional $290 billion. Citing research by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman showing that less than 1 percent of Americans control as much wealth as 90 percent of Americans, Hughes' plan to pay for that expansion involves increasing the income tax for the top 1 percent, or people earning more than $250,000 a year, to 50 percent from 35 percent, and treating capital gains as income—moving long-term capital gains from 20 percent to 50 percent, hitting the wealthiest the hardest. He’s putting his money where his mouth is too, underwriting a project that will give $500 a month to residents of Stockton, California. Will UBI save America? Our Congress and president just passed a tax law that reduces taxes on the country’s wealthiest, but I still think Hughes' proposal is reasonable in part because EITC is a pretty popular program. My fear is that the current political climate and our ability to discuss things rationally are severely impaired, and that's without factoring in the usual challenges of turning rational ideas into law. In the meantime, it’s great that Silicon Valley billionaires have recognized the potential negative impact of their businesses and are looking at and funding experiments to provide better evidence-based understanding of UBI, even if evidence appears to have less and less currency in today’s world. Am I optimistic? No. Should we get cracking on trying everything we can, and is UBI a decent shot on goal? Yes and yes. Photograph by WIRED/Getty Images   © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

        "text": "On Tuesday, March 9th, Amy Castro Baker stood on her front porch and watched as her two teen-age children boarded a bus and went off to school together for the first time in a year. Her sense of relief was profound. Baker, a researcher of economic mobility and an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Social Policy & Practice, had been through a challenging period familiar to most parents—and especially to working mothers. For the past year, she had balanced the demands of a full-time job with overseeing her kids’ online schooling, while also cooking, cleaning, and running the household as a single parent. “We’re at the point in my home where it’s a choice between what’s higher risk, COVID or my kids’ mental health,” Baker said. “I’m not sure I could have handled another month.” These are the kinds of difficulties that the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9-trillion pandemic-relief bill recently passed by Congress, was designed to address. Benefits in the bill could help millions of families who are facing similar challenges and are living under much greater financial precarity. The bill, which was signed by President Joe Biden on Thursday, offers a variety of benefits intended to address economic hardship caused by the pandemic. No Republicans voted for the legislation, largely based on the argument that the pandemic will end soon and the economy doesn’t need the help. And it’s true that some aspects of the legislation go beyond the demands of the pandemic, addressing economic disparities that existed before COVID-19 hit. The bill includes provisions to give one-time, fourteen-hundred-dollar payments to individuals earning fewer than eighty thousand dollars a year, and to increase unemployment insurance by three hundred dollars per week until early September. But it is the plan’s expanded, fully refundable child tax credit—which is worth thirty-six hundred dollars for each child under age six and three thousand dollars for those aged six to seventeen—that has the greatest potential to change the way that the United States addresses poverty. A typical child tax credit can only be claimed by people earning enough money to pay taxes in the first place, which excludes those with an earned income of fewer than twenty-five hundred dollars—in other words, those in the most dire need. The new child tax credit works differently: starting in July, the federal government will send cash each month, until December, to parents for every child that they have regardless of the family’s employment status, and the remaining balance will be disbursed once families file their taxes next year. “It will actually maintain and lift living standards for millions of women and their children,” Heidi Shierholz, a senior economist and director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute, told me, adding that she hopes the credit will eventually become a permanent benefit. “There’s also a massive racial-justice angle here, too. This will disproportionately help families of color, and it will disproportionately bring Black kids and Hispanic kids out of poverty. This is groundbreaking.” In some ways, the credit resembles much debated proposals to set up a universal-basic-income program, which would send cash to families every month to help them get by. Such a program never seemed possible in the United States, but lessons from the 2008 financial crisis, the Trump Presidency, and the pandemic have changed what policymakers are willing to try. “It signals a turn in the way that we approach alleviating poverty and supporting the unpaid care work of women that makes the economy move,” Baker told me. One of the only large-scale guaranteed-income experiments to take place in the U.S. since the nineteen-seventies is currently under way in Stockton, California. After the 2008 financial crisis, Stockton saw one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country. Since February, 2019, the city has been sending five hundred dollars a month, funded by philanthropic organizations, to a hundred and twenty-five people, with no strings attached. The program, called the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, is led by Stockton’s former mayor Michael Tubbs, and it has just released its first batch of data. Baker and Stacia Martin-West, a professor at the College of Social Work at the University of Tennessee, Nashville, are spearheading an ongoing evaluation of the trial results. The lessons that researchers learned from the first twelve months of the experiment may contain insights into how the federal stimulus plan’s child payments will affect the families who receive them, and how the government can address income inequality in the future. One of the biggest issues that low-income families face, Baker told me, is that their earnings are often unpredictable from month to month. The rise in unstable gig employment and the fluctuation of work shifts make it difficult for families to be sure that there will be enough money to pay the rent and buy adequate food. That combined with the unpredictable nature of expenses, especially those related to children, leads people in this position to have elevated levels of stress and anxiety, which can make it even harder for them to improve their financial situation. One of the questions driving the Stockton researchers is whether steady cash payments can reduce income volatility, and whether that may lead to other benefits, such as lower stress and more flexibility to seek out better jobs. Baker told me that the researchers are excited about the results so far. In the program’s first year, the guaranteed monthly payments did seem to reduce the volatility of monthly income. The recipients were more stable and better positioned to make thoughtful decisions about the future, to set goals and take risks. Ultimately, they were more likely to move from part-time to full-time employment. This runs directly counter to the argument that conservatives often make regarding universal basic income: that sending money to people will disincentivize working. In the case of the pandemic, Baker anticipates that the child tax credit will function much the same way. “What the pandemic has shown is that needs are very dynamic,” she said. “Something as small as three hundred dollars a month could mean the difference between getting a babysitter or not, making up gaps in food stamps or not. The pandemic has kind of pulled the veil back on all the ways that households with kids, especially, are scrambling to get by.” Since the Stockton experiment began, the mayors of more than forty cities across the country have committed to trying pilot programs involving cash transfers. Ten have been announced or launched so far, in cities including St. Paul, Pittsburgh, Oakland, and New Orleans. When I asked whether she was surprised to see the idea of universal basic income embraced by such a wide spectrum of groups, Baker said that she was. But she also saw the change as part of a broader historical trend. “When we look back, every major leap we have in the social safety net follows an economic drop that does not go away, and then a period of civil unrest,” she said. She noted that after the Great Recession of 2008 there was a protracted economic decline, which was accompanied by agitation on both the left and right sides of the political spectrum: Occupy Wall Street, the Tea Party, the election of Donald Trump, and Black Lives Matter, for example. Political norms have been dislodged, and things that were previously unthinkable now seem close to becoming reality. “People have been organizing and pushing back,” Baker said. “Maybe this period of churning means the public is ready for a conversation about the market and the safety net.”   © 2025 Condé Nast.

Here’s How People Spend It  Pilot programs across the U.S., including new research funded by OpenAI, offer a glimpse of how a universal basic income could improve lives By Allison Parshall edited by Ben Guarino & Clara Moskowitz Shideh Ghandeharizadeh In 2020, amid widespread layoffs and economic turmoil brought on by the COVID pandemic, 1,000 low-income people in Texas and Illinois won something of a lottery. They were selected to receive $1,000 per month—with no strings attached—for three years as part of a study on guaranteed income by OpenResearch, a nonprofit research organization funded in part by OpenAI and its founder, Sam Altman. Silicon Valley philanthropists are just one piece of a growing movement for using basic income to improve people’s lives. In recent years the Stanford Basic Income Lab and the Center for Guaranteed Income Research have been tracking 30-plus pilot programs that have tested basic income in towns and cities across the U.S. “There’s a long history of interest in basic income in the United States,” says Sara Kimberlin, executive director of the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality. Founding father Thomas Paine advocated for it in The Rights of Man. Martin Luther King, Jr., called it the solution to poverty. Even economist and free-market capitalist Milton Friedman suggested basic income in the form of a “negative income tax.” If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

When people receive unconditional cash, they tend to use the money in ways that increase their financial security and housing stability, Kimberlin says, pointing to a “large body of research.” Those observations line up with the most recent results from OpenResearch, which showed that participants increased spending to meet their basic needs and to help family and friends. A separate study published online in July in the Journal of the American Medical Association also found that cash benefits reduced emergency room visits. \"Cash is flexible. It gives people a lot of dignity and autonomy in deciding how they are going to use it.\" —Sara Kimberlin Taken as a whole, the evidence suggests that when people’s most basic needs are met, they start to build a firmer financial foundation for themselves and their family. Scientific American spoke with Kimberlin to learn more about these basic-­income pilot programs and how this unconditional, guaranteed aid improves people’s lives. An edited transcript of the interview follows. What is the promise of basic income? A key problem that basic income or guaranteed income is designed to address is the significant share of people and families who don’t have enough resources to be able to meet their essential needs. And we have a lot of research that shows the challenges that arise from struggling to meet your basic needs. For example, if you don’t have access to stable, safe housing, health care or food, that interferes with your ability to be a productive worker or to take care of your family. And if you’re a child, that interferes with your ability to concentrate in school. On the flip side, there’s a lot of research showing the positive things that happen when a policy ensures people’s needs can be met. It shows that when food stamps are introduced in a particular area, the outcomes for the families improve. Other research shows that children whose families received the Earned Income Tax Credit when they were young had more positive long-term educational outcomes, which translated to stronger financial security later in life. Why provide cash, as opposed to food stamps or rent assistance? Cash is flexible. People can use it to meet whatever their most pressing need may be. It’s an efficient way of addressing people’s needs, and it also gives people a lot of dignity and autonomy in deciding how they’re going to use it. It helps to avoid situations where someone may already have resources designated to pay for food but needs, for example, emergency child care. If they don’t get it, then they can’t get to their job, which could cause a lot of disruption down the line by making them miss a paycheck, then miss the rent. You can look at unconditional cash as a potentially very promising way of approaching social support because it streamlines the administrative costs and makes it easier for people to access the support they are eligible for. What stood out for you about the new findings from OpenResearch?  It’s a very large study, and it’s well designed and well funded. It studied a fairly broad, more representative population, rather than being targeted to a specific group such as parents of young children, which meant there was a lot of variation in the outcomes. It wasn’t surprising that the study found the most common uses of the funds were to cover basic needs such as housing, food and transportation. This is something we see consistently across guaranteed-income pilots that are tracked on the Guaranteed Income Pilots Dashboard on the Stanford Basic Income Lab website. Something that stood out for me was the significant increase in people spending money to help their friends and family. That struck me because it means there are some effects of this program that are not fully captured in the results. If a participant is saying, “Oh, my cousin called me because her husband lost his job, and they can’t make their rent this month, and I gave her some money so her family wouldn’t get evicted”—outcomes like that wouldn’t be fully captured in the participant data. There’s a ripple of positive effects that are going out beyond the direct recipient. People who received the cash worked an average of one hour less per week and were 2 percent less likely to be employed than people in a control group that received $50. What does that tell you?  People wonder: Does receiving unrestricted cash mean people are going to just stop working? How would that affect the labor market? There have been different findings across different studies. Some have shown somewhat increased employment. You can imagine how that’s possible. If receiving a basic income allows you to repair your car so that it’s reliable or pay for child care, that might make it more possible for you to get a job. There have also been studies that have shown no significant impact on employment. And then there have been studies that show some reductions in employment or in number of hours worked compared with a control group. That’s what was found in these OpenResearch results. One important piece of context here is that this study, along with many of the studies in this recent crop of guaranteed-income pilots, took place in the unusual economic setting of the pandemic. Unemployment was very high across the entire U.S. in both the treatment and the control group at the beginning of this study. Over the course of the three years lots of people in both groups went out and got jobs as more jobs became available again—overall, employment and hours worked increased in both groups, but they increased less in the group receiving $1,000. Many of the drivers that might cause somebody to work less when they receive a basic income could be seen as positive outcomes in other ways. For example, single parents or parents of young children might work fewer hours to spend more time directly caring for their children. Is just giving people money really a viable solution to poverty? Basic income, particularly at this scale that has been studied, is not a cure-all or magical solution to poverty. Access to health care, schooling, child care and affordable housing are still needed. I think it makes sense to think about basic income as a promising intervention that complements other parts of the social safety net. Unrestricted cash has a lot of power to be able to fill in places where the safety net is inadequate. What are some open questions about the impacts of basic income that you hope more research will answer? It’s really important to study how these programs work for different groups of people. There are different pilots focused on specific populations, such as people aging out of foster care, people experiencing domestic violence or people reentering society after incarceration. Understanding how it works for different groups is helpful for designing programs and policies. And a critical question is: What are the long-term effects of these programs, in particular on people’s health? A three-year study can’t address health problems that have developed over people’s lifetime. But if you had a long-term program in place, would you see different effects on people’s health, such as on chronic health conditions? And studying the potential effects of these programs on children’s long-term trajectories is very important. Some of those outcomes are not measurable yet, but they may be quite consequential for the people who receive the money and may ripple out to their families and communities.

Read more: Discover the Right Bank Account for Your Finances The initiative, Oregon Rebate, proposes to increase the minimum corporate tax rate for Oregon-based companies making more than $25 million per year in sales to 3 percent tax, whereas the current minimum sits under 1 percent. The amount raised would then be given to the Oregon's State Department of Revenue for rebate distribution, which means that every Oregonian—regardless of their age or income—would receive a guaranteed income. Any money left from the rebate would be used to fund services in favor of senior citizens, health care and public education. The proposal has passed the signature threshold of 117,173 needed to make it to the November ballot, having attracted more than 135,000 signatures as of June 14, as reported by Oregon Live. Now these same signatures must be certified by the office for the Oregon's Secretary of State. \"We are still collecting signatures and feel cautiously optimistic that we are doing the things we need to do to qualify for the November election,\" a spokesperson for Oregon Rebate told Newsweek. \"Formally, the Secretary of State will make that determination by or around mid-July, and we'd be thrilled to chat again then for a deeper interview if you are interested.\" Read more: Rates Are Still High for These High-Yield Savings Accounts If the proposed measure reaches the ballot and is approved by voters, it should come into effect as of January 2025. Should it be approved, Oregon would become the first state in the U.S. to create a universal basic income program—a historic event that could embolden the universal basic income movement in the country and pave the way for other states to follow. There are corporations and individuals in California who appear particularly interested in promoting the issue. Part of the contributions for the Oregon People's Rebate campaign came from Jones Holding LLC, a Los Angeles-based corporation controlled by investor and universal basic income supporter Josh Jones. The company made the highest contribution to the campaign, $425,000 out of the total $740,000 which Oregon People's Rebate received, according to Oregon Live. Read more: Best Place for Short-Term Investing: CD vs. High-Yield Savings Account The second-highest contribution came from a related company, Los Angeles-based Jones Parking, Inc, which put in $95,000. The third-highest came from California's universal basic income supporter and software engineer Gerald Huff's foundation and his mother, who contributed $90,000 together. Huff died in 2018. The rebate could have a tremendously positive impact in Oregon, according to the measure's proponents. On its website, Oregon Rebate estimates that the money—not taxable in the state—could reduce child poverty there by 26 percent. The rebate does not affect Oregonians' eligibility for income-based benefits. But while the measure's proponents say that the rebate will only ask that big corporations in Oregon pay their \"fair share\" of taxes (Oregonians pay about 5 to 10 percent for the state income tax), its opponents say it will scare businesses away from the state. In a statement to Newsweek, Oregon Business and Industry (OBI) President and CEO Angela Wilhelms said that the measure \"would impose a massive tax increase in Oregon.\" She added: \"If it qualifies for the ballot, our organization will be involved in a campaign against it, and we are confident that when voters look at the facts, they will vote to reject it.\" Update, 6/27/24 4:35 a.m. ET: This article was updated to include comments from Oregon Rebate and OBI. © 2025 Newsweek Digital LLC",

        "text": "The U.S. needs policies now to support workers made redundant by artificial intelligence. Listen to more stories on hark Artificial intelligence is coming for all our jobs. That is a prevalent fear these days, and not one easily dismissed. The specific effects of revolutionary technologies are impossible to predict, and perhaps AI will turn out to be overhyped. But it really is different from past advances: The work it can do really is different; the jobs it threatens really are different; its effects on the labor market really might be different. A pair of economists at Goldman Sachs recently estimated that two-thirds of American occupations are now “exposed” to AI-driven automation. In the coming decade, the technology will wipe out 300 million jobs, they forecast. That’s one in every 11 jobs on the planet. Here in the United States, an AI jobs revolution need not be anything for average wage-earning families to fear. If AI does not enslave the human race or destroy humanity outright, this generative technology can and should be a very, very good thing. It should lift productivity growth, increase our national wealth, and contribute to our commons of knowledge. Every person in this country can and should benefit from such an awe-inspiring invention. The problem with AI is not the technology. The problem is not even the technology’s potential effect on the labor market. The problem is that we do not have any policies in place to support workers in the event that AI causes mass job loss. The good news is that we do not need to invent them. Say hello to the universal basic income, a 500-year-old policy idea whose time has perhaps finally come. It is simple and radical in its design. The government would raise revenue by raising taxes. It would then distribute the money to everyone, in small amounts, in perpetuity, with no strings attached. To understand why this might be beneficial, imagine our economy as transfigured by AI—not 1,000 years from now, but 20 or 50 years. (This is still a hyper-speculative exercise, I admit, but a useful one nevertheless.) Let’s assume that AI will continue to improve at cognitive tasks. More and more people will use it to kill time. More and more businesses will use it for clerical, administrative, and creative work. This will reduce employment in the “middle tier of white-collar jobs,” David Autor, an economist at MIT and one of the country’s foremost experts on technological change and employment, told me recently. Annie Lowrey: AI isn’t omnipotent. It’s janky. If that happens slowly, workers will have time to adapt, shifting into new jobs created by AI or into sectors impervious to automation, such as care work. (Autor and his co-authors have estimated that three in five workers today are employed in occupations that did not exist 80 years ago.) But if job obsolescence happens quickly, mass unemployment and wage stagnation are likely, with inequality yawning to previously unseen levels. Employees will get piddling pay raises, shareholders huge dividends. The whole country will become richer while workers become poorer. But none of that has to happen. The government could capture some of the enormous bounty generated by this new technology and redistribute it to the people who supplied the training data that created it in the first place. A UBI would act as a tax-and-transfer program on steroids, correcting the inequality that AI is likely to gin up. The program would act as a social dividend, ensuring that everybody gets to share in the country’s new growth. It would also act as societal insurance, making certain that technological change does not damage our families and our polity, as has happened before. The China Shock, for instance—the large, persistent job losses in American and European manufacturing communities caused by China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001—worsened workers’ health, shortened their lives, and polarized their political views, all of which could have been mitigated by smart policy making. What about work? What happens if we just need less human labor, full stop? That’s a cultural question more than an economic one. A shortage of remunerative jobs is not the same thing as a shortage of work; there is always something to do. (The crew of the USS Enterprise was tasked with exploring new worlds and boldly going where no man has gone before, after all.) In a world of abundance, we could all work less and enjoy life more, if we could financially sustain ourselves while doing so. But in this new economic paradigm, we would need new policies to help us do that. And we would need a new mindset, one that understands wealth as something we all share and that prioritizes keeping each and every family financially secure, regardless of their participation in the job market. What worries me is that Americans may instead blame redundant workers for their own plight. Americans valorize work. We tolerate inequality and poverty. The problem is not the robots, then. The problem is us. TheAtlantic.com © 2025 The Atlantic Monthly Group. All Rights Reserved. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply",

        "text": "Last October, a fire tore through the apartment complex in Stockton, California, where Laura Kidd-Plummer had lived for five years. Nearly a decade earlier, Kidd-Plummer, who will turn seventy this year, had retired from her job in the wardrobe department at the Oakland Coliseum, where she had worked for twenty-one years. She eventually moved to Stockton in search of cheaper rent. After the fire, she and her dog, Poopee, a Pomeranian-Yorkie mix, were left homeless. Ever since, she told me, “I’m just trying to keep my head above water.” She stayed in a motel for a couple of months, which was covered by insurance, and then with acquaintances. In May, she moved into a loft in North Stockton. She was able to make the deposit on the apartment using funds she has received as a participant in the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, or SEED, a basic-income pilot program that has provided unconditional cash transfers of five hundred dollars per month to individuals over the last year and a half. Before SEED, Kidd-Plummer “had credit cards and had to use them to eat,” she said, because she was only eligible for sixteen dollars per month through food stamps. Now she’s able to cover food. “I’ve always worked, so most programs I’m not eligible for,” she told me. “I didn’t expect to be chosen. When I got the letter in the mail, I was floored.” The program, spearheaded by Stockton’s mayor, Michael Tubbs, was scheduled to end this summer: this month’s payment was slated to be the last. In late May, Tubbs announced that SEED would be extended through January, 2021, in response to the economic strain put on participants by the coronavirus pandemic. While the idea of extending the program had been under discussion even before the spread of COVID-19, Tubbs told me that current conditions made doing so a “moral imperative,” as many participants have lost work, and those classified as essential workers face increased risk. “COVID-19 has put the focus on the fact that a lot of Americans live in constant moments of economic disruption, because the fundamentals of the economy haven’t been working,” he told me. Tubbs, who is twenty-nine, is Stockton’s first Black mayor, and its youngest ever. After four years serving on the city council, he ran for mayor on a platform focussed on recovery from the 2008 crash, and was elected, in 2016, with seventy per cent of the vote, defeating an incumbent plagued by a string of scandals. SEED has relied on significant outside funding, as have several other projects that Tubbs has pursued, including an education initiative that has been run on a twenty-million-dollar private donation. Tubbs first encountered the concept of a universal basic income, or U.B.I., while he was an undergraduate at Stanford, in 2009, in a course that covered Martin Luther King, Jr.,’s advocacy for the idea late in his life. The possibility of issuing unconditional payments to a group of Stockton residents came up soon after Tubbs took office, in 2017, as a part of his staff’s research project on addressing poverty. Twenty per cent of Stockton’s residents fall below the poverty line, which is well above the state average, and residents of color are disproportionately affected. Still, Tubbs was initially skeptical—he worried about funding and thought that the idea could prove unpopular with voters. “This was my first time being elected,” he told me. “I didn’t want it to be my last.” The plan started to take shape, though, when Tubbs met Natalie Foster, a co-chair of the Economic Security Project, a basic-income advocacy group launched with the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. The organization was looking for a city in which to test a pilot, and gave Stockton a million-dollar grant. (The program’s extension will be funded separately, through a private donation.) The funding allowed a hundred and twenty-five participants each to receive five hundred dollars a month, an amount that was based on data indicating that around forty per cent of Americans can’t afford a four-hundred-dollar emergency expense. A hundred recipients in the program are anonymous, while the rest, including Kidd-Plummer, have volunteered to speak publicly about their experience. The study set out to prove that a basic income could, according to the research plan, “lead to reductions in monthly income volatility and provide greater income sufficiency, which will in turn lead to reduced psychological stress and improved physical functioning.” A random sample of residents in neighborhoods with populations that are at or below Stockton’s median income level were contacted. Around forty-three per cent of those who were chosen reported being employed either full or part time. Ten per cent of them are caregivers, a group that often fails to qualify for unemployment and other benefits. Tubbs told me that he doesn’t see a basic income as particularly radical but, instead, as “this generation’s extension of the safety net,” following in the path of things like Social Security, child-labor laws, weekends, and collective bargaining. Two professors of social work, Amy Castro Baker, of the University of Pennsylvania, and Stacia Martin-West, of the University of Tennessee, who have conducted research together on the gender and racial wealth gaps, were brought on to help design the pilot and evaluate the results. Stockton, they told me, was an ideal location: as of 2018, it was the most diverse city in the country; many of its residents moved from more expensive parts of the Bay Area and continue to commute into those cities for low-paying jobs; and it is, historically, the foreclosure capital of the United States. In designing the logistics of the program, they emphasized “rethinking our safety net with an anchor of justice and dignity,” as Castro Baker put it, while addressing “inequality predicated on racism and sexism.” Each month, participants receive payments on a debit card, which the researchers are able to track. No restrictions are placed on what the money can be used for; if participants don’t want their expenses tracked or prefer to use cash, they can transfer the money off the card. Castro Baker and Martin-West have also been studying the well-being of people in a control group who did not receive payments. Members of both groups complete monthly check-ins, during which they provide updates and summarize their mental state by using emojis. During the study, the researchers have released data on an online dashboard, where observers can read stories from participants and see spending trends change over time. For example, during the pandemic, the percentage of money that participants spent on food, consistently the largest category, reached nearly twenty-five per cent over the monthly average, while the amount spent on recreation dropped to less than two per cent. Participants have also put the money toward rent, car payments, and paying off debt, as well as one-off expenses for themselves or their children: dental surgery, a prom dress, football camp, and shoes. They’ve also been able to cut back on working second and third jobs; one participant, a forty-eight-year-old mother of two who works full time at Tesla, was able to stop working as a delivery driver for DoorDash. Alcohol and tobacco have accounted for less than one per cent of spending per month. Since SEED was launched, the idea of a basic income, which has long been considered a fringe idea, has gained at least provisional support from the Pope, Jack Dorsey, and Nancy Pelosi. Andrew Yang made U.B.I. a centerpiece of his Presidential campaign. More recently, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which is estimated to have kept twelve million people from sinking into poverty, included direct cash payments to every American with an annual income below seventy-five thousand dollars, and there are currently eight bills in Congress proposing some form of additional cash transfer to back up the checks that have already gone out. In May, eighty-four members of Congress signed a joint letter asking that monthly direct payments be included in future relief bills as “the most efficient mechanism for delivering economic relief to those most at-risk in this crisis.” Jennifer Burns, a history professor at Stanford University, told me that the bipartisan support for the CARES Act marked a significant shift in thinking about cash transfers. Although both Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon briefly considered forms of U.B.I.—Johnson as part of the War on Poverty, and Nixon as an element of the Family Assistance Plan—cash transfers have not, historically, been a widely popular political idea. Nixon’s proposal, which failed to pass in the Senate, was criticized on the right for “rewarding wasteful behavior,” as Burns put it, and on the left for endangering existing programs. Ultimately, the idea was adapted to become the Earned Income Tax Credit, a system of rebates for low-income Americans that has some similarities to a basic-income program but is conditioned on work. Recent calls for U.B.I. have mostly come from Silicon Valley, where libertarian-leaning entrepreneurs embraced the concept as a quick fix for job losses due to increased automation. According to Burns, the current crisis has shifted the focus away from hypothetical disasters toward inequities that already exist. In her view, the automation argument is primarily a distraction, but “if worrying about A.I. helps people look around and think about what’s already under way, that’s good.” The goal of SEED was always to promote the adoption of basic-income programs on a state or federal level, rather than to lay the groundwork for a long-term program in Stockton. Now, as the program moves into its final stretch, its creators have been flooded with requests for advice from pilot programs in development in other cities, including Seattle, Portland, Chicago, Newark, Nashville, and New Orleans. Last month, the U.S. Conference of Mayors adopted a resolution, led by Tubbs, that urges “cities, states, and the federal government to explore the feasibility of a guaranteed income” in response to the way in which “COVID-19 has shed light on economic insecurity and exposed the vulnerability of our current welfare system.” Shenna Bellows, a state senator in Maine who is leading a study committee on U.B.I., told me that, in recent months, her constituents “have really struggled with the byzantine unemployment and small-business-relief programs,” and she hopes “this crisis will point the way to simpler solutions.” Tubbs believes that the potential for a federal cash-transfer program hinges, primarily, on political will. “This country has a history of finding ways to pay for things that we say matter,” he told me. According to Hilary Hoynes, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, the annual cost of a truly universal federal-basic-income program in the U.S. would be around three trillion dollars, which is approximately three-fifths of current total federal expenditures. She believes that a more viable model could, at least initially, be structured like the CARES Act and SEED, with an income cutoff set considerably higher than those of current welfare programs. (Around eighty per cent of Stockton residents were eligible to take part in SEED.) Though this model falls short of universality, it would address a key failing in what’s currently available. As Hoynes put it, “more and more of the assistance that’s provided in America is conditional, and, as is very evident right now, programs that are conditioned on work aren’t helpful where work isn’t plentiful.” Burns told me that, even if discussion of U.B.I. drops off, its opponents “have had to at least engage with the idea, because it met so many of the needs of the crisis.”   © 2025 Condé Nast.

        "text": "How the pandemic took the concept of universal basic income out of Silicon Valley’s hands—and turned it into something far more radical. Several years ago, when Elizabeth Softky first heard of the concept of universal basic income, she had her doubts. She was a public school teacher at the time, and she knew how hard it was to convince people to support even modest financial benefits, like pay raises for her coworkers. “Giving people money? I couldn’t wrap my head around it,” she says. “You can’t just give people money.”  But that was before she was diagnosed with colon cancer, before aggressive chemotherapy left her unable to work and unable to pay the rent, before she was evicted from her home in Redwood City, California, and before she moved into an area homeless shelter. It was also before she got the call saying she was being accepted into a program offering six monthly payments of $500 to 15 people experiencing homelessness.  It was December 2020, and she was being invited into a pilot program, run by the non-profit Miracle Messages, providing guaranteed income—a direct cash transfer with no strings attached. For Softky, it was a lifeline. “For the first time in a long time, I felt like I could … take a deep breath, start saving, and see myself in the future,” she says.  The idea of “just giving people money” has been in and out of the news since becoming a favored cause for many high-profile Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, including Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, Facebook cofounders Mark Zuckerberg and (separately) Chris Hughes, and Singularity University’s Peter Diamandis. They proposed a universal basic income as a solution to the job losses and social conflict that would be wrought by automation and artificial intelligence—the very technologies their own companies create.  But while prominent names in technology are still involved today, especially when it comes to funding projects, the conversation has changed. Its center of gravity has shifted away from “universal basic income” aimed at counterbalancing the automation of work and toward “guaranteed income” aimed at addressing economic and racial injustices.  First proposed by philosophers in the 16th century, the idea of an income delivered directly by the state has been seen in many quarters as a balm for all kinds of social ills. Progressives argue that a guaranteed minimum income has the potential to lift communities out of poverty. Some conservatives and libertarians, meanwhile, see universal basic income as a cost-effective alternative to existing social welfare systems.  In the United States, proponents of guaranteed income as a matter of economic justice have included the Black Panthers and Martin Luther King Jr., while the libertarian economist Milton Friedman advocated it as a form of negative income tax. Even President Richard Nixon proposed providing cash directly to families, without conditions. His plan—produced after 1,000 economists urged it in an open letter—twice passed the House, but got rejected by the Senate. Tech-sector proponents of UBI tend to be driven by the libertarian model. It aligns both with their core beliefs about the future and with their primary theory of change. While it is not a technological solution per se ... it also kind of is. It’s the ultimate hack to get around the complexities of creating equitable social welfare policies.  It’s very much “in keeping with modern Silicon Valley's excitement for alternative policy experiments and ideas,” says Margaret O’Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who has written extensively on the history of the tech industry. “Like, ‘Okay, the regular systems and institutions aren’t working, and here’s this one cool trick.’”  When the concept of UBI began taking hold in Silicon Valley, many proponents looked outside the US for case studies. In 2017, Finland launched a two-year plan giving monthly payments to 2,000 unemployed citizens. In Canada, the government of Ontario announced a three-year program that was cut short when a more conservative party took control of the government. There have also been pilots in Iran, Spain, the Netherlands, and Germany.  But the United States has precedents as well. When Nixon was considering his own guaranteed income plan, studies were carried out in cities including Denver and Seattle. Since 1982, the Alaska Permanent Fund has given out a share of the state’s oil revenues to every adult resident (an average of $1,100 each year). A number of Native American tribes pay a share of casino revenues to every registered member. These American systems have shown almost no impact on the rate of employment—people don’t quit their jobs, one of the common concerns voiced by critics—but have led to improved outcomes in education, mental health, and crime.  Even so, there’s something that has felt inherently un-American about UBI. That’s why Softky objected when she first heard it discussed on the radio—“Because I was a good American,” she explains. (The implication being that a good American wouldn’t take handouts.)  \"For the first time in a long time, I felt like I could … take a deep breath, start saving, and see myself in the future.\" Former presidential hopeful Andrew Yang understood this cognitive barrier of “Americanness” when he proposed UBI as the centerpiece of his 2020 campaign for the Democratic nomination. He knew that what he decided to name his plan to mail monthly $1,000 checks to every American would be crucial to getting a positive reception, and so he workshopped multiple options before landing on “freedom dividend.”  After all, capitalism has become synonymous with the American dream, and what’s more capitalistic than a dividend? And freedom ... well, that part speaks for itself.  By the time Yang launched himself onto the presidential debate stage, a number of basic income pilot projects in American cities were starting to generate data.  One was the Magnolia Mother’s Trust (MMT), a guaranteed income pilot project in Jackson, Mississippi, that specifically targeted low-income Black mothers. In December 2018, its first cohort of 20 mothers received their first $1,000, and they would receive the same sum every month for a year (they were also given savings accounts for their children). For many, the $12,000 effectively doubled their annual income. The program has since added two more cohorts of 110 women each.  The focus on Black mothers was intentional, says Aisha Nyandoro of Springboard to Opportunity, the nonprofit behind MMT: “When we look at poverty in this country and who has been harmed the most,” she says, “it’s Black women.” The group also chose to start savings accounts for the children to address the fact that poverty in the US is often generational.  “So how do we go about ensuring that we are supporting well that population that has been marginalized?” Nyandoro asks. While the analysis is not complete, early results are promising. Compared with a control group, the pilot participants were 40% less likely to incur debt for emergency expenses and 27% more likely to visit a doctor. On average, they were able to set aside $150 each month for food and household expenses.  But for Nyandoro, these measurable “capitalistic outcomes” were only part of the story. They were important, but so were the dignity and agency that it returned to recipients. “For so many of the families that we work with,” she says, “they have not had someone to say to them, ‘You don’t have to prove that you deserve this. You simply deserve it because you are.’” In other words, guaranteed income wasn’t about handouts, but about giving everyone—starting with the most marginalized individuals—a chance at a fair shot.  Giving everybody a fair shot was also the mission of Michael Tubbs, then the newly elected mayor of Stockton, California, when he launched his city’s guaranteed income experiment in February 2019 and became the face of the renewed movement. The Stockton Economic Empower Demonstration, or SEED,  gave 125 randomly selected residents $500 a month for 18 months. It garnered plenty of attention—Tubbs and his efforts were even profiled in an HBO documentary—and drew funding from Chris Hughes’s nonprofit, the Economic Security Project. Results were encouraging. Most of the money went toward fulfilling basic needs. Food made up the largest spending category (37%), whereas just 1% was spent on alcohol or tobacco (an outcome that opponents had worried about). Meanwhile, rather than dropping out of the workforce, participants found jobs at twice the rate of a control group. Buoyed by this success, Tubbs started an organization, Mayors for Guaranteed Income, to expand his city’s pilot. To date, 42 mayors across America have signed on, and additional projects are now being run in towns and cities from Hudson, New York, and Gary, Indiana, to Compton, California.  Since the results of SEED’s first year were released in March, Tubbs has often been asked what he learned from it. “I am tempted to say ‘Nothing,’” he told me in late March. He means the pilot didn’t tell him anything that wasn’t already obvious to him: he knew from personal experience that many stereotypes about poor people (especially poor Black people) are not, as he put it, “rooted in reality.”  Tubbs was born in Stockton to a teenage mother and an incarcerated father. He attended Stanford on a need-based scholarship, and returned home after graduation. Soon he was elected to City Council, before becoming mayor when he was just 26.  Tubbs didn’t need the data to know he could trust people to make rational financial decisions, but the experience did help him “learn the power of narrative.”  He recognized that “sometimes ideology, sometimes racism,” colors people’s perceptions. Part of his job as mayor became to “illustrate what’s real and what’s not,” he says. He saw the chance to “illustrate what’s actually backed by data and what’s backed by bias.”  The need to change narratives through research and evidence was also apparent to Nyandoro, of Magnolia Mother’s Trust. A few days before the third cohort began receiving money, I asked her what research questions she hoped this new cycle would answer. “We have more than enough data now to prove that cash works,” she told me. Now her question was not how cash would affect low-income individuals but, rather, “What is the data or talking points that we need to get to the policymakers ... to move their hearts?” What evidence could be sufficient to make guaranteed income a federal-level policy?  As it turned out, what made the difference wasn’t more research but a global pandemic.  When stay-at-home orders closed many businesses—and destroyed jobs, especially for already vulnerable low-income workers—the chasm of American inequality became harder to ignore. Food lines stretched for miles. Millions of Americans faced eviction. Students without internet access at home resorted to sitting in public parking lots to hook into Wi-Fi so they could attend classes online.  This was all worse for people of color. By February 2021, Black and Hispanic women, who make up only a third of the female labor force, accounted for nearly half of women’s pandemic job losses. Black men, meanwhile, were unemployed at almost double the rate of other ethnic groups, according to Census data analyzed by the Pew Research Center.  All this also changed the conversation about the costs of guaranteed income programs. When the comparison was between basic income and the status quo, they’d been seen as too expensive to be realistic. But in the face of the recession caused by the pandemic, relief packages were suddenly seen as necessary to jump-start the American economy or, at the very least, avoid what Jerome Powell, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, called a “downward spiral” with “tragic” outcomes. \"Covid-19 really illustrated all the things that those of us who actually work with, and work for, and are in relationship with, folks who are economically insecure know.\" “Covid-19 really illustrated all the things that those of us who actually work with, and work for, and are in relationship with, folks who are economically insecure know,” says Tubbs. That is, poverty was not an issue of “the people. It’s with the systems. It's with the policies.” Stimulus payments and increased unemployment benefits—that is, direct cash transfers to Americans with no conditions attached—passed with huge public support. And earlier this year, an expanded Child and Dependent Tax Credit (CTC) was introduced that provides up to $3,600 per child, paid in monthly installments, to most American families.  This new benefit, which is set to last for a year, is available even to families that don’t make enough money to pay income tax; they had been left out of previous versions of the tax credit. And by sending monthly payments of up to $300 per child, rather than a single rebate at the end of the year, it gives families a better chance to plan and budget. It is expected to cut child poverty in half.  Washington might not have used the language of guaranteed income, but these programs fit the definition. The CTC is “a game changer,” says Natalie Foster, a cofounder of the Economic Security Project, which funded many of the guaranteed income pilots, including both SEED and Mayors for Guaranteed Income. It “overturns decades of punitive welfare policies in America,” she says, and sets the stage for more permanent policies.  Whereas her organization originally thought it might take a decade of data from city-based pilot programs to “inform federal policymaking,” the CTC means that guaranteed income has, at least temporarily, arrived.  The stimulus bills and CTC also make Tubbs “more bullish now than ever” that guaranteed income could soon become a permanent fixture of federal policy.  “We live in a time of pandemics,” he says. “It’s not just covid-19. It’s an earthquake next month. It’s wildfires. All these things are happening all the time—not even mentioning automation. We have to have the ability for our folks to build economic resilience.” But even if the rhetoric has shifted away from the technocratic concept of UBI, Silicon Valley’s interest in universality hasn’t gone away. Last April, Jack Dorsey announced a new philanthropic initiative, Start Small LLC, to give away $1 billion.  The donations would focus initially on covid-19 relief and then, after the pandemic, shift to universal basic income and girls’ education, he said. Putting money toward these causes, Dorsey explained, represented “the best long-term solutions to the existential problems facing the world.”  Despite its announced focus on universal basic income, StartSmall has become one of the largest funders of guaranteed income. It donated $18 million to Mayors for Guaranteed Income, $15 million to the Open Research Lab (previously known as the Y Combinator basic income experiment), $7 million to Humanity Forward, Andrew Yang’s foundation, and most recently $3.5 million to establish a Cash Transfer Lab at New York University to conduct more research on the issue.  Yang, now running for mayor of New York City, has also shifted away from his focus on universality. Rather than sending $1,000 checks every month to everyone, he now advocates for a guaranteed minimum income of $2,000 per year for New Yorkers living in extreme poverty.  Tubbs claims some credit for these shifts. He recalls a conversation with Dorsey in which he told the billionaire, “It’s gonna take time to get to universality, but it’s urgent that we do guaranteed income… So look, we’re not going to ... test a UBI. We can test the income guarantee. Let's start there.” If his donations are any indication, Dorsey took Tubbs’s words to heart. What’s still unclear, however, is whether he and other tech leaders see guaranteed income as a stepping-stone to UBI or as an end in itself. (Neither Dorsey nor Start Small staff responded to requests for an interview.) Scott Santens, one of the earliest “basic income bros,” believes that the tech sector’s initial interest in UBI as a fix for job loss is still relevant. The pandemic has led to an increase in sales of automation and robots, he says, pointing to reports that inquiries about Amazon’s call center tech have increased, as have purchases of warehouse robots to replace warehouse workers.  Meanwhile, Sam Altman, who helped kick off Y Combinator’s UBI experiment before leaving to head the artificial-intelligence startup OpenAI, wrote a recent manifesto about the situation. In it, he urged that we remain focused on the bigger picture: even if the pandemic has caused a short-term shock, it is technology—specifically, artificial intelligence—that will have the greatest impact on employment over time.  Altman called for the UBI to be funded by a 2.5% tax on businesses. “The best way to improve capitalism is to enable everyone to benefit from it directly as an equity owner,“ he wrote. But would “everyone” include people of color, who are already being harmed at disproportionate levels by AI’s biases? And could a dividend paid out from the spoils of artificial intelligence make up for that harm? Altman’s manifesto notably leaves out any mention of race.  When reached for comment, he sent a statement through an OpenAI representative saying, “We must build AI in a way that doesn’t cause more harm to traditionally marginalized communities. In addition to building the technology in an equitable and just way, we must also find a way to share the benefits broadly. These are independently important issues.”  He did not respond to specific requests for comments on how AI was already harming Black communities, and how Black men are already being erroneously charged with crimes on the basis of faulty facial recognition.  Margaret O’Mara, the technology historian, notes that for technologists, one thing hasn’t changed during the pandemic: the assumption that technological progress is inevitable—and positive. That promotes an attitude of “Let’s figure out how to adjust society around it rather than saying, well, maybe we should try to prevent the displacement in the first place,” she says. Tubbs, who recently cohosted a Clubhouse session with Altman, has a more generous—and straightforward—view of Silicon Valley’s role in the movement.  “I’m happy that they [technologists] are part of the conversation,” he says, because “a lot of revenue will come from them, or come from the products they make.” At the end of the day, after all, it’s largely tech money that allowed him to put an extra $500 in the hands of his pilot participants every month. “Once that money is given,” he says, what happens next is “up to the person who has the money.”  But what if the harms caused by the tech sector are the reason recipients needed tech largesse in the first place?  When Elizabeth Softky became homeless in 2018, she wasn’t alone; Redwood City's gentrification at the hands of tech companies and workers was in full swing. Economic forces far beyond her control have shaped her personal ups and downs. It’s “hyper-capitalism,” Softky says. She was grateful, of course, for her six months of guaranteed income—but also aware of the broader challenges that a short-term program run by a small nonprofit could not solve. Softky says she hopes the organization will expand both the amount of money it’s giving out and the duration of the program. But far better would be for the government to do the same.  We’re increasingly developing bonds with chatbots. While that’s safe for some, it’s dangerous for others. The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

        "text": "\n\n      Jennifer Ludden\n    \n \n                The proposed White House budget calls for cutting Housing and Urban Development rental aid and sending that smaller pot of money to states \"to design their own rental assistance programs based on their unique needs and preferences.\" The plan also would impose a two-year cap on rental assistance for able-bodied adults.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n President Trump has repeatedly promised to \"make America affordable again.\" But for those Americans most in need, his administration's latest budget plan would dramatically shrink the federal rental aid that helps keep millions of people housed. In its request for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the White House called the current system of federal rental assistance \"dysfunctional\" and proposed essentially ending Section 8 and other housing voucher programs. Its plan calls for cutting rental aid by about 40% and sending that money to states \"to design their own rental assistance programs based on their unique needs and preferences.\" It would also impose a two-year cap on rental assistance for able-bodied adults, which it said would ensure an even bigger share of federal subsidies went to the elderly and disabled. The budget does include $25 million in housing grants for young people aging out of foster care. In a statement, HUD Secretary Scott Turner called the budget request \"bold\" for reimagining aid programs that have become \"too bloated and bureaucratic to efficiently function.\" The proposal comes as nearly half of all renters are considered cost-burdened and as homelessness is at a record high. Advocates say that if millions of poor people barely making ends meet were to suddenly see their rental aid shrink — or even end altogether — it would tip many over the edge. \"We would see, I think, homelessness escalate in a way that has been really unprecedented, and unheard of,\" said Kim Johnson, policy manager with the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Already, federal rental aid falls far short of need. It's available for only about a quarter of all people eligible for it. \"Cutting that really feels like cutting into bone,\" said Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. The president's budget is only a suggestion, since Congress holds authority over spending and will create its own budget. But lawmakers are under pressure to find deep savings to enact Trump's larger agenda, which includes sweeping tax cuts. Some congressional Republicans have already targeted healthcare and food aid for next year's budget, but \"I don't think Congress has the appetite to enact cuts to the housing programs,\" says Kevin Corinth, with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. He sees the White House getting a kind of \"free pass\" to propose more ambitious HUD cuts that likely will not actually happen. While the White House budget blueprint would significantly shrink federal rental aid that helps millions of people, it said states could choose to pitch in with their own funding to make sure the same number of people are covered. The plan does give states more flexibility on how they can use that smaller pool of money, by sending it in the form of block grants. Welfare funding works this way. Over time, however, many states have diverted much, if not most, of that money to things other than cash aid for poor families. Housing advocates noted all this would be disruptive not only for tenants, but also for the millions of landlords who receive federal rental aid. Another part of Trump's budget calls for shrinking HUD funding for homelessness by 12% and putting a two-year cap on people's eligibility for aid. It also proposes a fundamental shift in how homelessness funding is allocated that would bypass thousands of local nonprofits and give the money directly to states. \"That is very concerning to us,\" said homelessness advocate Oliva. \"Homelessness is a very local issue. It happens in people's neighborhoods, it happens on city blocks and in city streets.\" Oliva said states simply don't have the infrastructure or expertise to ensure homelessness funding can go to where it's most effective. This change would also upend decades of federal policy by moving money away from permanent housing and toward shelters and shorter-term housing. Local advocates said the fallout from HUD cuts would affect much more than housing. \"We're talking about a massive impact across communities,\" said Jessica Kubicki with the Housing Collective in Connecticut. For example, people who may no longer be able to afford health insurance would be more likely to seek care in emergency rooms. The need for food aid would increase. And children in school could suffer if their parents were forced to leave their housing and squeeze in with family or friends. \"Because you've got maybe three kids sleeping in the same room, in the same bed,\" Kubicki said. \"They're not sleeping well. They're not doing well educationally. They don't have food.\" The cuts would also come on top of another impending loss of HUD funding. In 2021, as part of the COVID-era American Rescue Plan Act, the Biden administration funded 70,000 emergency housing vouchers for people without housing or at risk of losing it, and for those fleeing domestic violence. That money was supposed to last until 2030. But it's running out faster than expected because of how much rents have spiked in recent years. HUD has told local housing authorities to prepare for emergency voucher funding to end next year — and possibly sooner. In Connecticut, Kubicki is hoping the state can pick up that extra funding to give emergency voucher holders more time. But deep cuts to HUD's broader budget would make that even more difficult. \"This is not fixing anything,\" she said.\"This is making everything so much worse.\" While Corinth of AEI does not believe Congress will slash HUD's budget, he does think it's worth asking whether federal housing programs are fair. \"It makes sense to get people aid when they need it,\" he said, \"but we don't necessarily want them to stay on it forever.\" Many people receive housing subsidies for well over a decade. \"If the median or fair market rent is around, say, $4,000 for a family in San Francisco, your income can get really high and you're still going to be getting those subsidies,\" he said. Corinth also said when there's such a severe housing shortage like now, federal subsidies can goose the market and push up prices for everyone. He'd prefer to help people through other benefits, like tax credits. Another way he thinks rental aid is not fair: There's not nearly enough to help most people who are eligible for it. \"So I think it's very reasonable to say we should lower amounts, or have some kind of time limits,\" he said, \"to kind of share around the resources to others.\" Corinth suggested a five year time limit. Housing Secretary Turner has said the agency's ultimate goal is to \"get people off subsidies and live a life of self-sustainability.\" On a recent trip to Arkansas, where the prospect of federal budget cuts came up, he said HUD's job is to \"maximize the budget that we do have.\" Beyond rental aid cuts, the White House budget for HUD would eliminate a program that creates more affordable housing, and another that funds nonprofits to enforce fair housing laws. Also on the chopping block: community development grants that cities can spend on everything from childcare services to home repair for seniors. The White House said that money has been used for things the federal government should not fund, like a concert plaza and skateboard parks. Johnson, with the low-income housing coalition, said shrinking HUD funding could undermine the Trump administration's pledge to build affordable housing on federal lands. \"How are you going to build affordable housing if you're also cutting the programs that make those deals pencil out for developers?\" she said. Advocates worry that HUD funding for disaster recovery could also be disrupted. \"In my own experience, folks who can get out of a disaster shelter on their own do so,\" said Oliva, with the homelessness alliance. But those who were already precariously housed or who have disabling conditions, she said, \"without additional support, they will end up in the homeless services system.\" The White House proposal to shrink HUD's antipoverty programs doesn't come in a vacuum. The administration has already pushed out thousands of agency employees and signaled more staff cuts to come. It's canceled contracts that support low-income housing, and targeted housing and community development programs at other agencies. In a recent report on those moves, even before the White House's budget proposal came out, the National Association of Affordable Housing Lenders warned of far-reaching consequences. \"These disruptions would ripple through the broader economy, reducing construction activity, limiting job creation, and potentially destabilizing housing finance markets that depend on the certainty and liquidity provided by federal programs,\" the report said.

The property had received more than $4 million in federal tax credits and, in exchange, was supposed to remain affordable for decades. The company then used a legal loophole that stripped the affordability protections from the apartments. The maneuver appears to have been lucrative for the company, which bought the property for under $20 million and flipped it two years later for $63 million. Today, advertised rents there have gone up by around 50%. Similar stories have been playing out across the country for years, as developers and real estate investors take advantage of an obscure section of the tax code known as the “qualified contract” provision. It allows owners of low-income rental properties that have received generous tax credits to raise rents far sooner than the law typically requires. Some 115,000 apartments in the United States have lost rent restrictions as a result, according to one estimate. Experts say these conversions are exacerbating the nation’s shortage of affordable housing, which has intensified in recent years. One report recently concluded that the country has nearly 5 million fewer housing units than it needs. The problem is most acute for those with low incomes. The loophole has remained open for decades despite widespread agreement among regulators and advocates about its harm. Congressional efforts to repeal the provision have failed — most recently in 2023 — though state reforms have trimmed its effects. President Donald Trump has pledged to lower housing costs, but some advocates for reform are skeptical that his administration or a Republican-controlled Congress will strike a statute that can be lucrative to the real estate industry. (The White House did not respond to a request for comment.) “We have an affordable housing crisis just about everywhere in the country,” said Robert Rozen, a former Senate aide who helped draft the provision and now calls for its repeal. “We can’t afford to lose more affordable units, particularly as a result of a loophole in the law.” The statute is part of the law defining the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, which has become the primary catalyst for new affordable rental housing in the country. The program offers developers a tax subsidy worth potentially millions of dollars in exchange for keeping units affordable and renting them only to poor and working-class tenants. Typically that’s households making below 60% of the area median income. For a family of three to qualify in Phoenix last year, it would’ve had to make $55,560 or less. Rent and income restrictions are supposed to last at least 30 years. But, after just 14 years, property owners may ask their states to find buyers. This opt-out clause was meant to offer wary investors an early exit from the program while retaining the affordability protections on the properties. But it included a critical unintended flaw: States can only sell at prices set by a formula that almost always overvalues the properties. As a result, buyers are rarely found. If states can’t find buyers within a year, owners are free to raise rents on vacant units and, a few years later, on existing tenants as well. “It was obviously a mistake to include this in the law,” said Rozen, now an attorney specializing in affordable housing. “We didn’t know what we were doing when we constructed the buy-out formula.” The beneficiaries of this maneuver are often shielded from public view. The Arizona property, previously called Sombra Apartments, was flipped by a Delaware limited liability company that incorporated under the name Sombra Apartments LLC shortly before the purchase and has a small online footprint. Through a public records request, ProPublica received the application that triggered the loss of affordability protections, which shows the LLC was controlled by a real estate investment firm in Scottsdale, Arizona, called ReNue Properties. ReNue’s website says the company specializes in “the acquisition and rejuvenation of underperforming multifamily properties” and has generated an average 81% return. Michael Christiansen, whose LinkedIn profile lists him as ReNue’s CEO at the time of the transactions, did not respond to requests for comment. (More than 5,700 low-income units in the state have lost affordability protections through the same opt-out method, according to a 2023 Arizona Republic report.) Some companies exploiting the loophole appear to have done so with the indirect assistance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The government-sponsored enterprises support the nation’s housing sector, typically by buying mortgages to inject cash into the mortgage market. Property records show that the enterprises were involved in loans to owners of low-income housing who then stripped the properties of affordability protections or are seeking to do so. The enterprises’ involvement appears at odds with their declared support for affordable housing. Spokespeople for Fannie and Freddie did not respond to requests for comment. Two industry insiders defended the qualified contract process as a way to fight the shortage of middle-income housing. That’s the position of Charlie Moline, CEO of Moline Investment Management, who said he has used the mechanism to remove affordability protections from around 20 multifamily properties across the Midwest. Typically, low-income housing tax credit properties are too old and worn to be converted into high-end market-rate units, he said. But, freed of the income and rent limits, the properties can become appealing to middle-income renters after some basic renovations. “No one’s displaced by what we’re doing,” said Moline, who contends that he keeps rent increases moderate. “Our goal is to expand affordable housing to the missing middle.” That goal would be of little benefit to Lashunda Williams, a resident of a low-income apartment complex in Omaha, Nebraska, that Moline purchased last year and is taking through the opt-out process. Williams, 33, said she makes $17 an hour as a custodian at an Amazon warehouse and pays $899 for a one-bedroom apartment. “I can barely keep up with my rent half the time,” she said. If it increased, “I would have to move.” Moline’s argument was similarly unpersuasive to Rozen, the former Senate aide. “The bottom line is the owner is increasing his rental income and tenants who the program was intended to serve are losing their affordable rents,” Rozen said. “And the federal government is being taken advantage of.” Affordable housing proponents have long called for repealing the qualified contract provision. But congressional efforts to do so have fizzled, in part due to lobbying from developers and private equity firms with interests in low-income housing, according to a former congressional staffer involved in the repeal effort. Advocates have had more success pushing for state-level reforms. A majority of states now incentivize or require applicants for low-income housing tax credits to waive their opt-out rights, according to Moha Thakur of the National Housing Trust. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Department of Agriculture’s Rural Housing Service have also recently proposed or enacted policies to combat the problem. That includes a 2023 FHFA requirement that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac no longer invest in low-income housing eligible for early opt-outs. However, Fannie and Freddie can still back loans on such properties, which is more commonly how they are involved, according to Rozen. (Freddie has said it is studying the issue.) And given the Trump administration’s mass-scale attempts to demolish regulations, particularly those adopted under the Biden administration, it’s unclear whether the new policy initiatives will survive. The state-level changes have had an impact, bringing the number of apartments lost annually through the opt-out from around 10,000 a year to between 6,000 and 7,000. Without congressional action, however, the loophole remains on the books and a threat to poor tenants. “That loophole shouldn’t exist,” said Joy Noll, a tenant of the Arizona property, who lives on modest housing and disability subsidies. If rents rise further, Noll fears she will have to move: “It made it impossible for those of us who are low income to stay.” \n\tI cover housing and transportation, including the companies working in those fields and the regulators overseeing them.

A Trump administration proposal could put more than a million low-income households at risk of losing their government subsidized housing. That’s according to new research from New York University - obtained exclusively by The Associated Press. \n WOODINVILLE, Wash. (AP) — Havalah Hopkins rarely says no to the chain restaurant catering gigs that send her out to Seattle-area events — from church potlucks to office lunches and graduation parties. The delivery fees and tips she earns on top of $18 an hour mean it’s better than minimum-wage shift work, even though it’s not consistent. It helps her afford the government-subsidized apartment she and her 14-year-old autistic son have lived in for three years, though it’s still tough to make ends meet. “It’s a cycle of feeling defeated and depleted, no matter how much energy and effort and tenacity you have towards surviving,” Hopkins said. Still, the 33-year-old single mother is grateful she has stable housing — experts estimate just 1 in 4 low-income households eligible for U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development rental assistance get the benefits. And now Hopkins is at risk of losing her home, as federal officials move to restrict HUD policy. Amid a worsening national affordable housing and homelessness crisis, President Donald Trump’s administration is determined to reshape HUD’s expansive role providing stable housing for low-income people, which has been at the heart of its mission for generations. The proposed changes include a two-year limit on the federal government’s signature rental assistance programs.  \n At a June congressional budget hearing, HUD Secretary Scott Turner argued policies like time limits will fix waste and fraud in public housing and Section 8 voucher programs. “It’s broken and deviated from its original purpose, which is to temporarily help Americans in need,” Turner said. “HUD assistance is not supposed to be permanent.” Havalah Hopkins, a single mother who lives in government-subsidized housing with her teenage son, talks with a cashier as she buys some balloons for her son’s birthday at a Dollar Tree, Thursday, July 10, 2025, in Woodinville, Wash. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)  But the move to restrict such key subsidies would mark a significant retreat from the scope of HUD’s work. Millions of tenants moved in with the promise of subsidized housing for as long as they were poor enough to remain qualified, so time limits would be a seismic shift that could destabilize the most vulnerable households, many unlikely to ever afford today’s record-high rents.

New research from New York University, obtained exclusively by The Associated Press and published Thursday, found that if families were cut off after two years, 1.4 million households could lose their vouchers and public housing subsidies — largely working families with children. This would lead housing authorities to evict many families, the report said. A broad time limit would cause “substantial disruption and dislocation,” it said, noting the policy is largely untested and most of the few housing authorities to voluntarily try it eventually abandoned the pilots. A break from HUD’s long-held purpose of helping house the poor could also jeopardize its contracts with private landlords, who say they’re already feeling the uncertainty as public housing authorities from Seattle to Atlanta announce they’re scaling back in anticipation of federal funding cuts. Critics fear the restriction could derail those working towards self-sufficiency — defeating the goal time-limit supporters hope to achieve. HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett pushed back on the NYU study. “There is plenty of data that strongly supports time limits and shows that long-term government assistance without any incentive disincentivizes able-bodied Americans to work,” Lovett said in a statement. She primarily cited statistics suggesting low employment among HUD-subsidized tenants. Hopkins said the policy would likely leave her and her son homeless in an economy that often feels indifferent to working poor people like her. “A two-year time limit is ridiculous,” she said. “It’s so disrespectful. I think it’s dehumanizing — the whole system.” Havalah Hopkins, a single mother who lives in government-subsidized housing with her teenage son, pets her dog, Benny, in her bedroom Monday, July 14, 2025, in Woodinville, Wash. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)   Researchers from the Housing Solutions Lab at New York University’s Furman Center analyzed HUD’s data over a 10-year period and found about 70% of households who could be affected by a two-year limit had already been living on those subsidies for two or more years. That’s based on 2024 estimates and doesn’t include elderly and disabled people who wouldn’t be subject to time limits. Exempted households make up about half of the roughly 4.9 million households getting rental assistance. In the first study to examine the proposed policy’s possible impacts, the NYU researchers found time limits would largely punish families who are working but earning far below their area’s median income, which would ultimately shift federal rental assistance away from households with kids. “Housing assistance is especially impactful for children,” said Claudia Aiken, the study co-author and director of new research partnerships for the Housing Solutions Lab. Their health, education, employment and earnings potential can “change in really meaningful ways if they have stable housing,” she said. It would affect people like Hopkins, whose family was on a years-long waitlist in the expensive region where she grew up. In July 2022, she and her son moved into a two-bedroom public housing unit in Woodinville, Washington. She pays $450 a month in rent — 30% of her household income.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)  A market-rate apartment in the area costs at least $2,000 more, according to the King County Housing Authority, which in June announced it would pause issuing some new vouchers. Hopkins knows she could never afford to live in her home state without rental assistance. It was a relief they could stay as long as they needed. She had been struggling to scrape together hundreds of dollars more a month for her previous trailer home. “There’s no words to put on feeling like your housing is secure,” Hopkins said. “I feel like I was gasping for air and I’m finally able to breathe.” She credits the housing subsidy for her ability to finally leave an abusive marriage, and still dreams of more — perhaps her own catering business or working as a party decorator. “We all can’t be lawyers and doctors — and two years isn’t enough to even become that,” Hopkins said. Since learning of Trump’s proposal, Hopkins said she’s been haunted by thoughts of shoving her possessions into a van with her son, upending the stability she built for him.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)    The average household in HUD-subsidized housing stays about six years, studies show. HUD funds local public housing projects where nearly 1 million households live and the Section 8 vouchers that about 4 million households use to offset their private rentals. There’s been little guidance from HUD on how time-limited housing assistance would be implemented — how it would be enforced, when the clock starts and how the exemptions would be defined. Both Democrats and Republicans have acknowledged the potential for time limits to help curb HUD’s notorious waitlists. Hard-liners contend the threat of housing loss will push people to reach self-sufficiency; others see limits, when coupled with support and workforce incentives, as a means to motivate tenants to improve their lives. Yet there are strikingly few successful examples. NYU researchers identified just 17 public housing authorities that have tested time limits. None of the programs were designed for only two years and 11 abandoned the restriction — despite being able to use federal dollars for services to help people achieve self-sufficiency. Several agencies that dropped the limits said tenants still struggled to afford housing after their time was up. \n “These policies are complex and difficult to monitor, enforce, and do well,” NYU’s Aiken said. The city of Keene, New Hampshire, tried five-year time limits starting in 2001, but terminated the policy before fully enforcing it to avoid kicking out households that would still be “rent burdened, or potentially homeless,” said Josh Meehan, executive director of Keene Housing. In California, Shawnté Spears of the Housing Authority of San Mateo County said the agency has kept its five-year time limit in tandem with educational programs she says have “given folks motivation” to meet their goals. It also gives more people the chance to use vouchers, she said. NYU’s Aiken acknowledged HUD’s long waitlists make the current system “a bit of a lottery,” adding: “You could say that time limits are a way of increasing people’s odds in that lottery.”  HUD’s Section 8 programs have long depended on hundreds of thousands of for-profit and nonprofit small business owners and property managers to accept tenant vouchers. Now, landlords fear a two-year limit could put their contracts for HUD-subsidized housing in limbo. Amid the uncertainty, Denise Muha, executive director of the National Leased Housing Association, said multiple landlord groups have voiced their concerns about HUD’s next budget in a letter to congressional leaders. She said landlords generally agree two years is simply not enough time for most low-income tenants to change their fortunes. “As a practical matter, you’re going to increase your turnover, which is a cost,” Muha said. “Nobody wants to throw out their tenants without cause.” It’s always been a significant lift for private landlords to work with HUD subsidies, which involve burdensome paperwork, heavy oversight and maintenance inspections. But the trade-off is a near guarantee of dependable longer-term renters and rental income. If that’s compromised, some landlords say they’d pull back from the federal subsidy programs. Brad Suster, who owns 86 Chicago-area units funded by HUD, said accepting subsidies could become risky. “Would we have the same reliability that we know has traditionally come for countless years from the federal government?” Suster said. “That’s something landlords and owners want to know is there.” The diminishing housing stock available to low-income tenants has been a brewing problem for HUD. Between 2010 and 2020, some 50,000 housing providers left the voucher program, the agency has reported.

(AP Photo/Jon Cherry)    It’s up for debate whether lawmakers will buy into Trump’s vision for HUD. This week the U.S. House appropriations committee is taking up HUD’s 2026 budget, which so far makes no mention of time limits. HUD’s Lovett noted the Senate’s budget plans for the agency have not yet been released, and said the administration remains focused on future implementation of time limits. “HUD will continue to engage with colleagues on the hill to ensure a seamless transition and enforcement of any new time limit,” Lovett said in a statement. Noëlle Porter, the director of government affairs at the National Housing Law Project, said Trump’s fight for time limits is far from over, noting that legislative and rule changes could make them a reality. “It is clearly a stated goal of the administration to impose work requirements and time limits on rental assistance, even though it would be wildly unpopular,” Porter said. Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina says there’s no evidence time limits would save HUD money. “This doesn’t help families who already are working multiple jobs to become self-sufficient,” Clyburn said at a June hearing. “Instead, it creates chaos, financial uncertainty and pushes these families into more severe trade-offs.” Time limits could imperil Aaliyah Barnes’ longtime dream of graduating college and becoming a nurse, finding a job and a home she can afford.

(AP Photo/Jon Cherry)  The 28-year-old single mom in Louisville, Kentucky, this year joined Family Scholar House, which provides counseling and support for people pursuing an education — and, to Barnes’ relief, housing. Her apartment is paid for by a Section 8 voucher. In March, Barnes moved in and her 3-year-old son, Aarmoni, finally got his own room, where she set up a learning wall. Previously, she had struggled to afford housing on her wages at a call center — and living with her mom, two sisters and their kids in a cramped house was an environment ridden with arguments. The stable future she’s building could disappear, though, if she’s forced out in two years when her schooling is expected to take three years. “I’d be so close, but so far away,” Barnes said.

        "text": "Experts warn that the cuts may harm vulnerable Americans. A contract to inspect low-income and other assisted housing for gas leaks, faulty smoke detectors and other life-threatening deficiencies was terminated by the Trump administration in February as part of its cost-cutting efforts, according to a Department of Government Efficiency database, potentially leaving thousands of vulnerable Americans in harm's way. Tom Feehan, a veteran home inspector who lost work as part of the termination, told ABC News that these legally required inspections frequently uncover painted-over ceiling sprinklers, defective gas ranges and any number of home-related liabilities that can pose a danger to occupants. \"By not doing [the inspections], we're not catching those,\" Feehan said. \"So those are not being repaired, and it's putting people at risk.\" Last year, the contractor, Project Solutions Inc., in its third year of working with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, was assigned to inspect roughly 6,200 public housing and multifamily properties across the country over the course of 12 months. In addition to flagging dangerous conditions, the inspections ensure that tenants have hot and cold water, safe electrical outlets, and working heating and cooling systems, experts said. A HUD official told ABC News that the contract was for \"software modification,\" despite Project Solutions identifying the contract as being for inspection services. The HUD official declined to elaborate on the reason behind the contract's termination. The sudden termination threatens thousands of inspections, according to Robin Miller, a contract manager at Project Solutions, including those at roughly 250 \"priority\" properties, where inspections were already delayed or significant deficiencies were found during previous inspections. Project Solution's contract termination was among more than 7,000 federal contracts canceled by DOGE and posted to the agency's \"Wall of Receipts\" web page in recent weeks. The DOGE site claimed that terminating the inspection contract would return $285 million to taxpayers. But Miller, the Project Solutions official, said that figure was inflated because it was based on a high estimated ceiling value that wasn't reflective of what the contract would actually cost. According to federal spending records, HUD had only awarded Project Solutions roughly $29 million so far. Experts said it was unclear how housing officials planned to carry out the outstanding inspections. HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett said in a statement that \"HUD is reviewing all contracts for efficiency and effectiveness to accomplish good government goals,\" and that \"certain contracts were found not to accomplish HUD's mission with economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.\" Industry experts said that the inspections, which are required by law, will likely fall to other contractors at a similar price. But arranging those inspections will take time, experts said, and delaying inspections compounds the risks for tenants. \"We're helping low-income people and we're helping senior citizens maintain a safe, livable environment,\" Feehan said. \"And with not getting these inspections done on time, it's hurting them.\" Another HUD-certified inspector based in Illinois, who asked that their name not be used so they could speak freely about their field of work, told ABC News that one of the properties that was scheduled to be inspected until the Project Solutions contract was canceled was a 24-unit multifamily property that had received far below the \"failing\" score, meaning significant deficiencies were found during its previous inspection and the property needed more frequent inspections. The property was already past due its Dec. 13, 2024, inspection date, and its inspection has yet to be rescheduled, the inspector said. Project Solutions was one of at least three contractors that were hired to inspect HUD-insured and assisted properties under the agency's Real Estate Assessment Center program, which is aimed at \"improving housing quality by performing accurate, credible, and reliable assessments\" of its properties. \"I 100% agree that all governments, all organizations, businesses, even personal family units, should routinely review budget and spending habits and cut things out that are not necessary,\" the Illinois inspector said. \"Get rid of the fraud, waste abuse -- but you have to be responsible about it.\" \"If it wasn't for DOGE, we'd still be doing the contract. That's my opinion,\" Feehan said. \"DOGE is trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse. I didn't see where there was waste fraud and abuse with PSI.\" Alia Trindle, co-director of political strategy at housing advocacy group Right to the City Alliance, stressed that many HUD-funded buildings have been in dire shape for decades due to past funding cuts. She said for some properties, tenants and advocates have had to organize to push for basic repairs after years of neglect. \"Working-class and poor communities have to contend with substandard and neglected housing that could have devastating long-term health consequences for those that live there, from mold to pest to a lack of access to basic utilities like water and heat,\" Trindle said. \"So regular inspections, whether done by HUD or HUD-affiliated groups or by municipalities, are critical to ensuring that those who are responsible for this housing stock do the bare minimum to maintain them,\" she said.

        "text": "Published Mar 12, 2025 at 07:30 AM EDT updated Mar 14, 2025 at 04:02 PM EDT Breaking News Editor The Trump administration has moved to terminate a $1 billion program aimed at preserving affordable housing, a decision that could disrupt efforts to maintain tens of thousands of units for low-income Americans. The move, directed by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is part of broader funding freezes at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), according to an internal document reviewed by The Associated Press. DOGE has come under scrutiny for the pace, depth, and breadth of its cuts to federal funding under its mission to eliminate waste and fraud. Trump, responding to such criticism, said he wants Musk's DOGE to use a \"scalpel\" and not a \"hatchet\" in its approach to spending cuts. The Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, passed by Congress in 2022, was designed to provide grants and loans for energy-efficiency improvements in affordable housing units. While officially intended to promote sustainability, the funding was also a crucial mechanism for keeping units affordable. Participating projects were required to maintain affordability for up to 25 years, and the federal funds often served as a key financial lever to attract additional investment. Without this support, thousands of affordable units could deteriorate or be lost entirely. The program had already allocated funding to upgrade at least 25,000 housing units nationwide, but HUD has not clarified how it will handle the rollback. According to an internal HUD document obtained by the AP, the decision to shutter the program came at the direction of DOGE. Two HUD employees, speaking anonymously due to fear of reprisals, confirmed the directive. HUD did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Mike Essian, vice president at American Community Developers, Inc., which had received program funding, warned that without this support, projects could collapse. \"Projects will fail, and these are projects that are already difficult to finance,\" Essian said. The U.S. is experiencing a significant affordable housing crisis, characterized by soaring home prices and escalating rents that outpace income growth. The shortage of affordable housing units further compounds the issue. This crisis has led to an 18 percent rise in homelessness nationwide, per HUD data, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive policy interventions to expand affordable housing. Residents and property managers impacted by the funding freeze have expressed deep concern. The Smith Tower Apartments in Vancouver, Washington—a 170-unit building serving low-income seniors—had been approved for a $10 million grant from the program to help fund a crucial $100 million renovation, including safety measures. \"The potential loss seriously jeopardizes our ability to be able to provide an upgrade to the current systems,\" said Greg Franks, president of the building's management company. \"This work is needed to sustain the livability of this building based on its age, and to keep it viable for another 60 years.\" \"If we are losing the homes that are currently affordable and available to households, then we're losing ground on the crisis,\" Sarah Saadian, vice president of public policy at the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in October. \"It's sort of like having a boat with a hole at the bottom.\" With HUD silent on the future of the program, affordable housing developers and property managers are scrambling for contingency plans. Some projects that had already been approved may still receive funding, but many remain in limbo. Across 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, hundreds of affordable housing projects now face uncertainty. Without the necessary funding, many buildings could fall into disrepair, further exacerbating the nation's housing crisis.

        "text": "Watch CBS News \nUpdated on:  June 18, 2024 / 2:33 PM EDT\n            / CBS News\n           More than 18 million Americans are living in homes that stretch their budgets far beyond what's considered financially healthy.  That's the biggest takeaway from a LendingTree study released this week that found that 18.3 million homeowners are what the housing industry calls cost-burdened, or \"house poor.\" That refers to homeowners who pay more than 30% of their monthly income on housing, including the mortgage, utilities and other costs. Anyone who spends more than half of their monthly income on housing is considered severely cost-burdened. High cost-of-living states California, Hawaii and New York have the largest share of house poor residents, while West Virginia, Indiana and Arkansas have the fewest, LendingTree said.  To be sure, homeowners who spend more than 30% of their income on housing aren't necessarily struggling to make ends meet, according to Jacob Channel, LendingTree senior economist, noting that some people can spend more than 30% of their income on housing and remain comfortable financially. But for many Americans, keeping housing costs at a manageable level is difficult, particularly in an economy where inflation is still high, home prices have reached record highs and mortgage rates are hovering around 7%. The median U.S. home price hit an all-time high this month of $394,000, up 4.4% from a year ago, according to Redfin.  LendingTree based its study on 2022 U.S. Census data on how much owner-occupied households spent on housing. The study suggests that the number of house-poor homeowners is falling. About 19 million homeowners were house poor or worse in 2023, according to a Harvard University estimate.  Here is a breakdown of the states with the highest concentration of cost-burdened homes, according to LendingTree. Here's a breakdown of the states with the lowest concentration of cost-burdened homes, according to LendingTree.  \n      Edited by\n                                        \n                                  Anne Marie D.

        "text": "Moving low-income, Black people into ‘better’ neighborhoods splits up communities and does not solve poverty For 20 or so years, the architects of public housing have clung tightly to what became conventional wisdom in the field: move residents of low-income neighborhoods out of public housing and into economically resourced neighborhoods. As the theory goes, middle-class and wealthy communities with high-quality schools, healthcare and public facilities could work “wonders” on the residents of low-income and mostly Black neighborhoods. This idea – which advocates call “mixed-income housing” and includes Section 8, among other programs – depends on the idea that people with low incomes, especially those who are Black, are somehow culturally deficient. They need to be immersed in “better” neighborhoods so they are no longer exposed to food deserts, street violence and a lack of employment opportunities. More often than not, this policy experiment fails. In Chicago, many residents who were moved into higher-income neighborhoods ended up living in Black, low-income neighborhoods within five years. Mixed-income housing policy initiatives have struggled for a variety of reasons, but mostly because they are rooted in racist notions of public housing as a breeding ground for Black dysfunction. It’s clear “compassionate relocation” has been a notoriously mixed bag. Sociologist Ann Owens found that mixed-income housing policy has had a minimal impact on concentrated poverty from 1977 to 2008. Another study examined the experiences of 4,600 families who participated in the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program, which offered families subsidized vouchers for private rentals. Moving improved the educational prospects of younger children and the mental health of women (who wouldn’t feel better in housing not plagued by chronic plumbing or heating problems, pests and cramped living conditions?). But relocation had no effect on employment or income for people who moved as adults. Economic opportunity didn’t magically appear at a new address. By the 1990s, scholars and politicians had made a cottage industry out of claiming that grouping poor Black people in high-density residential communities causes poor quality of life in the form of struggling schools and other ills. If you subscribe to this view, you probably believe poverty spreads among people with lower incomes like a highly contagious virus. The US Department Housing and Urban Development (HUD) bought into this narrative and, with its Hope VI transformation plans, emphasized moving former public housing residents out of their old neighborhoods. The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA), one of the nation’s largest public housing systems, committed to this course of action in 1999. Soon Chicago began demolishing “severely distressed public housing”. Among them were high-rise public housing developments like the infamous Cabrini-Green complex, which became a national symbol of urban blight and failed housing policy; those ideas were imprinted on the American imagination when Cabrini-Green appeared as the location of the 1970s sitcom Good Times and as the nightmarish setting for the 1992 horror film Candyman. The real experts on how relocation is not all it’s cracked up to be are the very targets of resettlement. As a political scientist who studies public housing, I’ve interviewed dozens of women who lived in properties owned by the CHA, which has a 50-year-old track record of grossly mismanaged and dilapidated public housing. I attended a memorable 2011 CHA tenants association meeting where women questioned discriminatory drug-testing policies in mixed-income housing developments. A CHA official claimed, “We don’t have a drug policy.” Chaos erupted because the women knew otherwise. Developers who managed mixed-housing programs often did as they pleased and made their own policies, sometimes in violation of CHA or HUD rules. Later in the meeting, another official seemed to admit those enrolled in mixed-income programs were subjected to more drug testing than residents who paid full market value. That contradicted talking points from advocacy groups like the National Housing Conference. It has contended that “mixed-income communities provide a safer environment that offers a greater range of positive role models and exposure to more job leads for area residents”. Transplanted residents weren’t safer, but rather vulnerable to additional surveillance, potential interaction with law enforcement (sometimes when neighbors reported them for no reason) and a different kind of stress in their nice, new homes. White supremacy and class bias followed residents wherever they moved, if they could move. Many participants in voucher programs continue to have trouble finding landlords willing to accept them. Researchers who hew to the old, entrenched school of thought – that masses of poor Black people living together are the problem – don’t seem to grasp that kids who once lived in public housing may not be accepted in their new schools. Or that their parents don’t “fit in” enough to get a nearby job. Or that groceries and life essentials are often more expensive in wealthier areas. Or that families are often placed in suburbs far from any of the public housing or welfare offices, let alone public hospitals and other support systems. Robert Chaskin and Mark Joseph coined a term for the marginalization of relocated families: “Incorporated exclusion”. People considered “lucky” enough to “get out” deal with isolation from valuable community networks. Contrary to popular belief and social entitlement policy, such networks and social support do exist in public housing. Far from being the “welfare queens” of the Reagan era, residents work hard and frequently to support each other. They provide childcare or elder care, organize meals for each other and advise neighbors on how to deal with bureaucracy that ignores the crumbling state of public housing it’s supposed to maintain. Sign up to First Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Yet mixed-income housing policy has shown little to no consideration of the importance of living near friends, family, church, schools and so on. Lack of easy access to community can also have detrimental effects on both community and individual health. By transferring residents all over metro Chicago, the CHA disrupted mutual aid mechanisms. Importantly, it also undermined tenants’ ability to organize and advocate for themselves. Because Black and poor Americans are presumed to be socially, culturally and spiritually broken, US poverty policy has never prioritized maintaining or protecting their communities. We don’t have enough meaningful public conversation about what redlining housing discrimination, systemic underdevelopment of places like Chicago’s South Side and police torture have done to low-income Black communities today. Housing policies forged in racism, sexism and classism do little but duplicate anti-Blackness and socioeconomic biases. Mixed-income housing policy attempts to shift the blame for what geographer Ruthie Wilson Gilmore calls “the organized government abandonment” of public housing stock and inner cities, de facto economic dead zones where white people and investment will not go. The problem is not high concentrations of Black, low-income people causing negative child and family outcomes. Rather, it’s that our government, businesses, schools and citizens discriminate against the working class, the poor and the unhoused. Members of the “underclass” – once a popular term in US poverty studies – are literally pushed out of sight and into public housing, low-performing schools and low-wage jobs. We deny them the rights to safe and secure housing, transportation and living-wage employment. White, middle-class and wealthy citizens refuse to frequent businesses or attend schools in high-poverty neighborhoods, and businesses are disincentivized to offer services in neighborhoods with high numbers of Black people. Assumptions about public housing residents have been built into the very foundations of public housing policy. It’s time to retire these damaging scripts – and eradicate them in policy because, as Fannie Lou Hamer said: “Nobody’s free until everybody’s free.” Alex J.

María Lara and her 10-year-old daughter, Ashley, live in Langley Park, Md., a densely populated, low-income suburb of Washington, D.C. She says the worst part about living in the Bedford and Victoria Station complex, a multifamily residential property, is that she and her daughter don't feel safe. \"These apartments are rotten,\" Lara says, because the place is \"roach- and mice-infested, water leaks everywhere, [the] walls have holes and pipes are exposed.\" Her kitchen floors are buckling, and Lara can see down to her neighbor's first-floor apartment. \"I feel like the ceiling is going to collapse on us or we are going to fall on my neighbor below us,\" the 44-year-old native of El Salvador says. Ashley worries about being bitten by bedbugs or rodents at night. \"Sometimes my daughter wakes up in the middle of the night when she hears rats and mice roaming around,\" Lara says, fighting back tears. Ashley asks her mom if rodent traps are set up in the apartment. \"She's anxious and stressed and often develops difficulty breathing.\" \n                The bottom of María Lara's oven is broken and full of mice feces.

The complaint alleges violations of the Fair Housing Act, including intentional discrimination based on race and national origin. The company's business strategy, the complaint alleges, involves the \"intentional targeting of these low-income communities of color.\" \"Basic maintenance and necessary repairs to both properties have been ignored and neglected to the point that the exclusively minority families living in them are forced to live in conditions that belie expected housing conditions in the region,\" the complaint states. CASA de Maryland, an immigrant advocacy organization headquartered in Hyattsville, Md., organized the tenants for months and is also a plaintiff in the case. \"The conditions at the BVS [Bedford and Victoria Station] properties, deteriorating in real time around the families living in them, would shock the conscience of most Marylanders and others living only a short distance away,\" according to the complaint. \n                Jesús González says that the landlord recently repainted his bathroom after a drawn-out dispute.\n                \n                    \n                    Ian Morton/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n The Bedford and Victoria Station complex is managed by Ross Companies, a defendant in the class action. According to the company's website, Ross is \"a premier owner, renovator and manager of multifamily assets in the Mid-Atlantic region since 1983.\" NPR reached out to the company's public relations office in Bethesda, Md., and was told that \"the company has seen the complaint, but it's not talking to the media. We speak with our residents.\" NPR reached out to Arbor Realty Trust but got no response to requests for comment. According to the complaint, the company owns \"over 8,000 units and has acquired more than $1.75 billion of multifamily properties across the country.\" Like many immigrants, Lara says crushing poverty pushed her to migrate to the Washington area in 2006. She thought life in the U.S. would be easier, but it has been a struggle. Ashley's father abandoned them when Lara was expecting the baby. Lara works in construction, cleaning and prepping materials — work that isn't always reliable. The coronavirus pandemic severely cut her work hours to less than half. Lara has lived in the Bedford and Victoria Station complex since 2009, and though Lara says management has neglected the units for a long time, she says that the pandemic lockdown seems to have emboldened her landlord. When she has asked for needed repairs in her unit, \"the manager says, why don't you leave if you don't like it here?\" \n                Jesús González, who has lived in Bedford and Victoria Station for 15 years, says he has put much of his time, energy and money into fixing his apartment to keep it clean.\n                \n                    \n                    Ian Morton/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n If she could, Lara would move, \"but I don't have options.

It's not easy for people to get up and move.\" A 2019 study published in the American Journal of Sociology explored the burden of housing costs on low-income renters in urban neighborhoods, landlord exploitation and the high profit margins gained by landlords that own properties in those areas. \n                Top: The front door to María Lara's apartment is broken.

They don't have many options, even if they're living in an apartment that's falling apart around them, like the apartments in Langley Park.\" Arbor Realty Trust Inc. is managed by Arbor Commercial Mortgage LLC, and according to the complaint, Arbor Realty Trust \"exerts controlling authority over the co-defendants and subsidiaries,\" including Bedford United LLC, Victoria United LLC and others. The LLC, or limited liability company, model is used by large companies to organize themselves, says Donahue, but also to wall off their business. \n                Jesús González shows the extension cable he uses to run power from the main outlet of the apartment into his bedroom to power the air conditioning unit.

When you rent a house, you have to follow landlord-tenant laws, but an LLC is typically a company behind a company and it can skirt those laws, he argues in an interview with NPR and in the complaint. \"I believe they have created a conflict of interest for themselves,\" Donahue says, describing the allegations in the complaint. Arbor Realty Trust Inc., a publicly traded company, has a duty to ensure profits for its shareholders, he says, but it also has duties to its tenants under the law. \"They need to provide safe homes,\" Donahue says. In describing the complaint, he told NPR, \"Arbor has violated their duties to their tenants. It's profits for nameless shareholders and terrible conditions for folks who live and pay their rent in these properties.\" \n                María Lara shows a loose and broken window in her home.

Residents don't have central air conditioning or heat, and tenants have to set up their own air conditioning units and portable heaters, according to González. González, 65, says he suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol and has breathing difficulties. He often uses supplemental oxygen, he says. He has stayed put for 15 years \"because of the neighborhood. We are all Hispanics here. If you need an onion or salt, I feel comfortable borrowing those from a neighbor. I feel the warmth of El Salvador here.\" González came to the U.S. from the small Central American country more than three decades ago. \"We are tired of being neglected, being ignored,\" he says. He adds that his community was heavily affected by the pandemic, with many losing jobs and unable to pay rent or buy food. \"Hunger and need pushed us to sue the landlord — to say enough. We have never asked for free housing. What we ask for is fair housing conditions.\" The Bedford and Victoria Station complex houses 589 units, built in the 1940s \"and never significantly renovated,\" according to the complaint, which alleges that living conditions for families have worsened because repairs, rodent infestation and toxic mold have been neglected. The complaint asks the court to certify the lawsuit as a class action on behalf of all tenants. Donahue, the attorney, says he hopes the litigation sheds light on the practices of investors that, he says, take advantage of low-income, multifamily residential properties such as the one in Langley Park. \"There's a lot of companies that own properties like this, and they don't fix them and they squeeze the properties for rent,\" he says. \"This needs to stop.\"",

        "text": "  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro would transform and expand a housing assistance program for the poor and give renters a tax credit in a housing plan he unveiled Monday. “People are experiencing an affordable housing crisis, whether they live in a red or blue community, whether they are white or black. This rental affordability touches the lives of so many,” said Castro, who served as President Barack Obama’s housing secretary, in unveiling the first installment of his three-part housing plan. Just 25 percent of people eligible for the housing subsidies actually get vouchers, Castro said, and he wants to transform the housing assistance program, known as Section 8, into a fully funded entitlement program — a reference to federal safety net programs such as Social Security. In addition, Castro called for a refundable tax credit for low- and middle-income renters if their rent exceeds 30 percent of their income. It would be a progressive tax credit that would give priority to low-income individuals and cover families earning 50 to 100 percent of the area median income. The credit would be paid monthly and participants could direct their credits to a tax-advantaged savings account to use for a down payment on a mortgage. Castro said housing affordability is an issue that affects seniors on a fixed income, young adults trying to save for their first home, renters in gentrifying neighborhoods and mobile home owners who rent the land under their homes. He plans to release plans later on how he'll pay for these and other policy proposals he's announced. Castro also seeks to increase the supply of affordable housing with investments in construction of additional public housing, in upgrades of public housing and through the expansion of the Low Income Housing Tax Credit. “Housing is a human right,” Castro stated in his plan. He set lofty goals for housing should he be elected. He said he would end veteran, child and youth homelessness by the end of his first term and end chronic homelessness by the end of 2028. Castro had planned to release his housing platform Monday at the Poor People’s Campaign presidential forum in Washington, but a canceled flight kept him from getting to the forum in time. The Poor People’s Campaign serves low-income people, and the forum was intended for allow members to hear from Democratic candidates on their plans to combat systemic racism and poverty. “I’m committed to working toward prosperity for every single American no matter their background,” Castro told NBC News on Monday. “The fact is in our nation’s history, poverty and racism have been so intertwined that we need to address both at the same time.” Castro grew up in a poor area of San Antonio, Texas, and is the only Latino candidate in the race. He has yet to break into the upper ranks of the crowded Democratic field but did qualify for the Democratic debates in Miami on June 26 and 27. He'll appear on the first night. The remaining installments of his housing platform were to be released Tuesday and Wednesday. FOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.

Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published. The complaints started as soon as Louisiana launched its massive program to help homeowners rebuild after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Community leaders said the largest rebuilding program in U.S. history would be unfair to the state’s poorest residents. Activists and real estate experts spoke out at meetings of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which designed and ran the Road Home program. An attorney representing poor homeowners testified before Congress. A fair housing group sued the state and federal governments. State officials made tweaks and settled the lawsuit, but they never changed a core part of the formula that determined how much homeowners received. Now a groundbreaking analysis of nearly 92,000 rebuilding grants statewide shows critics were right all along: Road Home shortchanged people in poor neighborhoods while giving those in wealthy neighborhoods more of what they needed. People in the most impoverished areas in New Orleans — those with a median income of $15,000 or less — had to cover 30% of their rebuilding costs after Road Home grants, Federal Emergency Management Agency aid and insurance. In areas where the median income was more than $75,000, the shortfall was 20%, according to the analysis by ProPublica, The Times-Picayune | The Advocate and WWL-TV. Median household income Damage left uncovered for all properties in each income group 30% <$15K $15-30K 27% 25% $30-45K $45-60K 23% 23% $60-75K >$75K 20% Poverty tracks closely with race in New Orleans, so the shortfalls in the city disproportionately hurt Black people. Road Home also underpaid residents of St. Bernard Parish, a mostly white, working-class community devastated by the hurricane. Had properties in the lowest-income parts of New Orleans been covered at the same rate as the wealthiest, each of those households would have received about $18,000 more on average. Across the city, covering all homeowners’ repair costs at the rate of the highest earners would have resulted in another $349 million for rebuilding. The Road Home program was hugely consequential for Louisiana, and much more so for its largest city, most of which flooded after Katrina’s storm surge overwhelmed its levees. Most homeowners didn’t have adequate insurance. Facing the possibility of a mass exodus, state leaders devised Road Home to cover the gap and encourage people to rebuild. Road Home also allowed homeowners to sell their property to the state and move elsewhere, though housing was scarce in the region. If homeowners didn’t stay in Louisiana, they forfeited 40% of their home’s value. New Orleans was the biggest beneficiary of rebuilding grants, and half of all owner-occupied homes in New Orleans received rebuilding grants, with $3.3 billion awarded citywide. Some neighborhoods rebounded quickly. Others languished. Housing advocates say that’s due to the original sin of the Road Home program: It calculated each grant based on a home’s value before the hurricane or on the cost of repairs — whichever was less. The value of most homes in poor areas was lower than the cost of rebuilding them, so the resulting grants didn’t cover all repairs. But for most people in affluent areas, the rebuilding cost was lower than the value of their homes. They got grants that came closer to covering their needs. “The practical effects of how this program shaped the city can still be seen today,” said Davida Finger, an attorney who testified to Congress in 2009 about unfairness in the Road Home program. Poor New Orleanians had a much harder time covering the costs. For a homeowner in the lowest-income areas, it would have taken more than 43 months at the average annual salary to pay the cost of repairs not covered by Road Home, FEMA and insurance, the news outlets found. In the highest-income areas, it would have taken less than eight months. The shortcomings in the Road Home program are part of a broader tapestry of failures in the ways America helps people affected by catastrophes. A yearlong investigation by ProPublica, The Times-Picayune | The Advocate and WWL-TV has found that disaster programs often shortchange the people who need it most, worsening inequities in the wake of disaster. Finger said the news organizations’ findings were “shocking but not surprising.” “What Black homeowners, what lawyers, what advocates, what community organizers, what reporters were telling the program designers all along was completely accurate,” Finger said. “They simply didn’t want to hear it.” The state Office of Community Development took issue with the analysis, but none of the points it raised affected the news organizations’ findings. Two officials who were in charge of the recovery told the news outlets that the findings were troubling. Andy Kopplin, the first executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, stressed that state officials took pains to steer more money to poorer homeowners through a second grant program. But Kopplin acknowledged in a written statement that the findings show that low- and middle-income households should’ve received more. That’s “upsetting to those of us who were working to create more equitable outcomes and especially to those families who needed and deserved more resources for their recovery,” he wrote. Walter Leger, who was a key board member of the LRA, said the findings should spur the state to seek more federal aid from Congress to fill the gaps. De’Marcus Finnell, deputy press secretary for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, declined to address the findings directly. But in a statement he said HUD’s experience after Katrina led it to favor programs that guide homeowners through rebuilding rather than giving homeowners money “and letting them manage the recovery process on their own.” In fact, federal rules no longer allow homeowners to be compensated for losses after a disaster, and Leger said using property values to determine aid after Katrina now appears to have been a misstep. “The plan was to help the homeowner repair his home or her home and get back in the home,” Leger said. The news organizations’ analysis shows there were disparities, he said, and “that’s something that should have been, and maybe should be, addressed.” Before Katrina, the neighborhoods of Lakeview and Gentilly Woods had a lot in common. Both sat below sea level on reclaimed swampland near Lake Pontchartrain. They boasted similar post-World War II housing stock. Lakeview was almost entirely white, and Gentilly Woods was more than two-thirds Black. Lakeview residents had higher incomes, and their homes commanded higher prices. Both neighborhoods were swamped when the floodwalls along New Orleans’ drainage canals buckled after Katrina. Water reached the eaves of many homes. Road Home appraised the average Lakeview home at $326,000 and the average repair cost at $286,000. With a grant based on the repair cost, the average homeowner received 83% of what was needed to rebuild, according to the news organizations’ analysis. In Gentilly Woods, the average property was valued at $121,000, with $203,000 in rebuilding costs. With a grant based on the home’s value, the average homeowner ended up with just 73% of what was needed to rebuild. Among those served well by Road Home was Lakeview retiree Rita Legrand, 86. She had to gut her modest ranch home. But she was determined to rebuild. With $53,000 from insurance in hand, Legrand applied for a Road Home grant in fall 2006. Road Home estimated her home’s value at $320,000 and her repair costs at $188,000. Her grant, based on repair costs minus what she’d already gotten from insurance, was $135,000. The grant and insurance proceeds covered her entire loss, as it was supposed to, and by April 2007 she had completely rebuilt. “The program worked great for me,” she said. The experience was quite different for Cynthia and Charles Heisser of Gentilly Woods. Like Legrand, the Heissers had a small ranch house, and they had a similar repair estimate: $190,000. But their initial grant was just $32,000. Charles Heisser, a 90-year-old Korean War veteran, still has the documents explaining how Road Home arrived at that figure. Program officials estimated the pre-storm value of their home at $83,000. The state subtracted $40,000 in insurance proceeds, which their lender had made them use to pay off their mortgage, and $10,500 in FEMA aid they had received for living expenses. Charles Heisser appealed, arguing Road Home had failed to factor in tens of thousands of dollars in improvements they had made before the storm. Their home was reappraised for $135,000. That increased their grant to about $83,500. Even then, their total compensation including insurance and FEMA grants was $135,000 — just 70% of Road Home’s original estimate of what it would take to make their home livable. The Heissers spent some of the Road Home grant to convert their garage into living quarters so they could move out of the FEMA trailer in their front yard. For most of the next 10 years, the house sat with a new roof and an unfinished interior where they hung laundry. Cynthia Heisser couldn’t help but notice how differently things went in mostly white parts of New Orleans. “It was unjust, more unjust to the Blacks than it was to the whites,” she said. People used to ask her, she recalled, “‘Oh, you don’t have your house yet?’ Or ‘You’re not in your home yet?’ And we’d say, ‘It isn’t because we’re not fighting for it. We are.’” A nonprofit called Rebuilding Together New Orleans eventually provided labor and materials to help finish repairs. The Heissers finally moved back into their house in 2018 — 13 years after the storm. From the beginning, Road Home had a problem. On the one hand, thousands of residents desperately needed rebuilding aid. On the other, Road Home, like many disaster aid programs, had guardrails to make sure people didn’t end up better off than before the storm. The idea was that “it would be illegitimate for somebody whose house only had a market value of $100,000 to get $120,000, even if that was how much it would cost to repair,” said Andy Horowitz, a history professor at the University of Connecticut and author of “Katrina: A History, 1915-2015.” When people complained that using home values to calculate grants would help some people more than others, officials argued that pre-storm value had been part of the formula from the start. Besides, Leger said at the time, it was required by the federal government, and there wasn’t enough time or money to change the rules. In a June 2006 interview shortly after the program was approved, Louisiana Recovery Authority chair Norman Francis dismissed the very problem many poor homeowners would soon face — that the cost of rebuilding could far exceed the value of their homes. “That money is going to cover the difference between your damages and how much insurance you got,” Francis said. “Now, if you had a $50,000 home, not likely that you had $200,000 worth of damage. So the formula has to take into consideration your home value.” A family member said Francis, now 91, was unavailable to comment for this story. Melanie Ehrlich, who lived in Baltimore while her Gentilly home was rebuilt, said she quickly saw the problem with the formula. She founded a grassroots organization, the Citizens’ Road Home Action Team, and became a thorn in the side of Road Home officials. “It was crystal clear how very unfair the program was in its design,” said Ehrlich, a Tulane University genetics professor. “What I saw is that the victims of Hurricane Katrina were being victimized again.” In October 2006, shortly after Road Home was launched, Ehrlich met with officials in charge of the recovery and argued their formula for calculating grants was unfair. She followed up with examples. Basing grants on the pre-storm value of homes, she wrote, would “justifiably anger the middle and lower economic classes, or, more specifically, everyone who does not have an expensive house or lot.” As homeowners received their grant letters over the course of 2007, hundreds showed up at Finger’s low-income law clinic at Loyola University. She attended dozens of public meetings in Baton Rouge, New Orleans and Washington to ask officials to fix the inequity baked into the calculations. In August 2009, Finger told a congressional committee that the formula disproportionately hurt Black residents because their homes tended to be valued for less. “Road Home’s grant formula design assured that some homeowners would not receive sufficient rebuilding funds,” she said. Six state officials involved with the recovery effort said they didn’t ignore these complaints. But they noted that they were building a program of unprecedented scope and dealing with unforeseen problems, all while under intense pressure to get money to homeowners quickly. Leger said he took Ehrlich’s complaint about pre-storm value to HUD officials and asked to use higher repair estimates instead. “We were told no,” he said. Soon after the program launched, state officials said, they made changes that increased grants for all applicants: factoring land value into appraisals, using the highest of several appraisal methods and increasing rates for repair estimates. They originally envisioned an affordable loan program to fill any gaps between grants and the actual costs of rebuilding, but it never got off the ground. In 2007, they created another grant for less affluent homeowners whose initial grants didn’t meet their damage estimates. That enabled the state to meet a HUD requirement to pay at least half of grant money to low- and moderate-income households. Three years later, after Black homeowners sued the head of the LRA and HUD alleging the program was discriminatory, Francis said, “That did not pass on my radar screen. If it had, I would have questioned why the program wasn’t treating people equitably.” Francis was a revered civil rights leader and longtime president of Xavier University, a historically Black school, and Finger said she does not believe he and the other architects of Road Home intended it to be discriminatory. Nonetheless, Finger said, “It is very difficult to look at a system that’s trying to roll out that much money as quickly as possible and to not do it in a way that replicates historic, systemic inequities.” The plaintiffs in the suit included Almarie Ford, who said the hurricane shutters that adorn her New Orleans East home are all she ever got from Road Home. A month after Katrina, Ford returned to find her Kingswood subdivision in ruins. The now-73-year-old social worker recalled walking into her house and gagging on the smell of black mold. She turned around, locked the front door and left, unsure what to do next. Like many homeowners, she expected significant government assistance, but it never came. Road Home officials assessed her damage at about $297,000 but based her grant on her home’s value, $150,000. They gave her just $3,468 after subtracting about $146,500 in insurance payments. If the grant had been based on rebuilding costs, she would have received the maximum Road Home grant of $150,000. Instead, Ford took out a loan and exhausted her savings. “I was shocked,” Ford said of the size of her grant. “But what could you do? You could complain that you only got $3,500. But they said, ‘Well, those are the rules.’” She wasn’t willing to accept what she described as an injustice without a fight. So she went to the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center. In 2008, the housing center had joined with PolicyLink, a California nonprofit, to collect examples that showed Road Home’s formula disproportionately hurt poor communities and people of color. Ironically, PolicyLink had teamed with the LRA two years earlier to present the state’s initial recovery plan. In a sign of just how unexpected the inequities were, a PolicyLink representative spoke at an LRA board meeting in April 2006 and “applauded the board for the design of the housing action plan,” according to meeting minutes. James Perry, the head of the housing center, said his organization examined two nearly identical homes: four bedrooms, two bathrooms, brick construction. Each had flooded with 6 feet of water and had damages estimated at more than $200,000. But one house was in a white neighborhood and the other in a Black neighborhood. Each homeowner received a grant based on their home value. Perry said the white homeowner got $150,000; the Black homeowner, $90,000. Perry said his organization gave that information to Road Home and HUD, but neither took immediate action. Perry said he was shocked by what he perceived to be their lack of interest. “It wasn’t easy to remedy, but it seemed to me they would want to.” In the resulting lawsuit, attorneys cited 2000 census data to prove their case: About 93% of Black-owned homes in New Orleans were valued at less than $150,000, compared to 55% of white-owned homes. The homeowners secured an important victory before a federal district judge in 2010. The next year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned that ruling and sent the case back to district court, rejecting claims the grant formula was discriminatory. The appeals court ruled that any gap in grants for Black families had been eliminated when, after the lawsuit had been filed, the state removed a $50,000 cap on the additional grant for low-income homeowners. But the news outlets’ analysis shows the appeals court’s assessment was wrong. The additional grants did help homeowners in lower-income, nonwhite areas in New Orleans, most of which are majority Black. Thanks in part to the program, the average grant to a Black homeowner in Louisiana was slightly larger than the average grant overall, according to state records. But in the end, the additional grants merely boosted the average share of damage covered by grants and insurance from about 51% to about 70% in those parts of New Orleans. That meant poor, nonwhite areas ultimately fared about the same as middle-income nonwhite areas, but not as well as even the poorest white ones. The analysis backs up what U.S. District Court Judge Henry Kennedy wrote in 2010 in a preliminary ruling: “The Court does not take lightly that some African American homeowners received lower awards than they would have if their homes were in predominantly white neighborhoods.” Louisiana and HUD “offered no legitimate reason for taking pre-storm home values into account” when calculating grants, he wrote. While the appeals court accused plaintiffs of cherry-picking their data by focusing on majority-Black New Orleans, the news outlets’ analysis shows the disparity between wealthy and poor neighborhoods statewide was similar to that in New Orleans. Three months after the appeals court ruling, Louisiana and HUD settled the lawsuit. The state agreed to put $62 million aside for yet another program, this one for people who made too much money to qualify for additional grants but needed more help. It was a drop in the bucket. According to a state analysis in 2010, 25,000 New Orleans homeowners received a total of $1.2 billion less from the Road Home because their grants were calculated using pre-storm value rather than the cost of damage. Despite being a plaintiff in the suit, Ford said she didn’t receive anything from the settlement. Fewer than 500 people did. It took more than three years for her to complete repairs. During that time, she rented an apartment in Baton Rouge and continued to pay her mortgage, a strain that she said nearly broke her. “It didn’t work for the people it was supposed to work for,” Ford said of the recovery program. “None of the people that I know in New Orleans East actually got any Road Home money. A lot of people, especially people who are more elderly, they just didn’t come back.” One morning in September, Lynette Boutte picked up a piece of artwork in her Seventh Ward beauty salon. In the middle was a photo illustration of hundreds of Black people near the intersection of North Claiborne and Orleans avenues. It depicted Super Sunday in 2003, two years before the storm. Boutte gazed wistfully, as if she could still hear the calls of the Mardi Gras Indians that day. Since Katrina, there hasn’t been such a raucous Super Sunday celebration in her neighborhood. Music was once the lifeblood of the Seventh Ward, a working-class Creole neighborhood near the French Quarter. It has produced musical greats such as Jelly Roll Morton and John Boutte, one of her nine siblings. After school, the sound of children playing trumpets would echo through the streets. In the evenings, musicians would fill her house for jam sessions. The Seventh Ward doesn’t sing like it used to, she said. “There are no children in this neighborhood anymore.” Boutte didn’t receive a dime from Road Home to rebuild, she said, because the state lowballed her property value and repair costs. It took her nearly a decade, but she managed to rebuild with the help of relatives and church volunteers. Many weren’t so lucky. Families who had lived in the neighborhood for generations were unable to return because they couldn’t afford to fix their homes. In the two decades after 2000, the number of children in the Seventh Ward dropped by more than a third, according to the Data Center, a community research nonprofit. The Black population in the Seventh Ward decreased by about 19 percentage points. When asked how much responsibility the Road Home program shares for these changes, Boutte didn’t hesitate. “They are responsible for it all,” she said. William Stoudt, executive director of Rebuilding Together New Orleans, which focuses on the Seventh Ward, said over the past 15 years his staffers have witnessed many people living in “completely substandard conditions.” Road Home’s grant formula is partly to blame, he said. Residents who got shortchanged had to cut corners, often hiring subpar contractors and using cheaper materials, he said. Some abandoned their properties because they couldn’t afford to rebuild; others sold them to predatory developers at below-market prices. “Most of the homeowners that we help work their entire lives for 11 bucks an hour at a hotel in the Quarter cleaning rooms day after day and have no savings,” he said. “They never had a chance.” The community is now pockmarked with empty lots and abandoned homes. Nearly 1 in 4 Seventh Ward houses were vacant in 2020, a 51% increase compared to two decades prior, according to the Data Center. In Lakeview, where Stoudt grew up, the post-Katrina recovery looks dramatically different. Stoudt remembers standing in his street three weeks after the storm amid uprooted trees and abandoned cars covered in dried mud. The waterlogged front door of his family home had swollen shut. To get inside, his parents climbed a ladder and went in through a second-story window. It was the silence, though, that haunted him. Stoudt said it seemed as if everything had died. “It was the quietest place you’ve ever been in your life.” That silence was soon replaced by the sound of hammers and saws. His parents’ flood insurance policy covered the cost of repairs, so they didn’t need a Road Home grant. Construction began almost immediately. Within a year, their home had been rebuilt. Today, he said, Lakeview is largely unrecognizable. People didn’t just rebuild, they expanded — replacing their ranch houses with multistory, modern homes. “Now it’s McMansions, 4,000 square feet, double-lot monsters,” Stoudt said. “If you were in the right neighborhood, you got what you needed to rebuild.” To evaluate the impacts of the Road Home program, The Times-Picayune, ProPublica and WWL-TV obtained a novel dataset of more than 130,000 grants from the Louisiana Division of Administration. The anonymized dataset included, for each grant recipient in the state, the grant amounts, the pre-storm value of the property and any insurance and FEMA payouts. The analysis was conducted on a subset of 91,771 rebuilding grants that had valid grant and damage amounts, were not part of a lawsuit over errors in grant calculations and did not fall under a limited number of other circumstances that could yield incorrect information. Our analysis focused on 30,188 records from Orleans Parish and 5,911 from St. Bernard Parish. For our analysis of demographics and income, we used data from Summary File 3 in the 2000 U.S. Census, downloaded from IPUMS NHGIS, University of Minnesota. This dataset contains survey responses from the longform census questionnaire, which was sent to approximately one in six households, and is available on the block group level. In the city of New Orleans, additional analysis using 2000 census data was conducted using Neighborhood Statistical Areas provided by the New Orleans Data Center, a nonprofit research center that defines those boundaries. Any use of “neighborhoods” refers to these boundaries. The word “areas” refers to census block groups. \n\tSophie Chou is a data reporter at ProPublica.

I’m writing this sitting in my kitchen, at a table for two my husband inherited from his grandmother. We have a small house in Murphysboro, in southern Illinois, and we have made it our own. I especially love it this time of year. Stockings hang from the fireplace mantel near the tree, which is decorated with an eclectic collection of ornaments we both brought to our marriage. My dog is staring at me, wondering if he can have some of my toast. I’m wearing fuzzy slippers and drinking hot tea. There’s a light dusting of snow outside, but it’s warm in here. This is my home. It’s a place that feels safe. I spend a lot of time thinking about my home and how where we live becomes part of who we are. Where we live determines the air we breathe, where children go to school and the people we are surrounded by. Whether renting or owning, where people live has a profound impact on their quality of life. For many low-income families, a safe, decent home is out of reach. That’s why I’ve spent so much time reporting on low-income housing. Last week, I wrote about residents of the Taft Homes in Peoria, who’ve lived for years in unsafe conditions as promises their apartments would be redeveloped were repeatedly dashed. And this week, I looked at a privately run complex in Chicago that had been taken over with great fanfare two decades ago but which has fallen into disrepair. These stories followed reporting on Illinois housing issues from 2018, when I examined the fallout of a public housing crisis in Cairo, at the state’s southern border, and found that poor conditions and financial mismanagement in East St. Louis persisted despite a federal takeover of that city’s housing authority that spanned more than 30 years. There is not a single city in Illinois where a person can afford a two-bedroom rental on a minimum wage job, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, an organization that advocates for housing solutions for people living in deep poverty. A great deal of the affordable housing options that do exist are in neighborhoods without basic amenities like grocery stores or access to transportation. Housing policies and practices have the ability to help achieve great things: to ensure every child has a warm, safe place to sleep; to alleviate homelessness; to integrate neighborhoods; to diversify schools. But for decades in Illinois — and many other states — cities have weaponized housing policies to perpetuate segregation and to exclude people from neighborhoods and schools. In Illinois, some 440,000 people live in homes that receive federal subsidies to offset rental costs, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington-based research and policy institute focused on poverty related issues. In some federally subsidized housing, conditions have been allowed to deteriorate. The problems can be so extreme they make people sick — especially children, seniors and people with disabilities. I started reporting on this issue in 2015, when the public housing crisis emerged in Cairo. In 2018, I was part of ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network. Through that partnership, we explored federal and local oversight failures that contributed to poor conditions for families in small and midsized cities across the country. I’ve logged hundreds of miles on my Jeep traveling to various cities and knocking on doors. I’m touched by the number of people who have invited me into their lives, to talk to me about what’s working — and what isn’t — in their homes and neighborhoods. Every year, I’ve learned more about this topic and, with each story, I have come to realize just how intricately linked housing is to other issues such as health and access to quality education — and how little these connections are understood. I’m going to continue to follow housing issues in Illinois and throughout the Midwest, so please reach out to me with story ideas or thoughts to share. In the meantime, here’s a look at some of our work on this topic: You can read the rest of the housing stories I’ve done here.

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)                                   \n SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Homeless people in California are already a vulnerable group, often struggling with poor health, trauma and deep poverty before they lose their housing, according to a new study on adult homelessness. The study released Tuesday by the University of California, San Francisco attempts to capture a comprehensive picture of how people become homeless in California, and what impeded their efforts at finding permanent housing. The representative survey of nearly 3,200 homeless people found that when they lost housing, their median household income was $960 a month, and for renters on leases it was $1,400 a month, of which on average half went to rent.  “People are homeless because their rent is too high. And their options are too few. And they have no cushion,” said Dr. Margot Kushel, lead investigator and director of UCSF’s Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative. “And it really makes you wonder how different things would look if we could solve that underlying problem.” Homelessness is a national crisis, and all too pervasive in California, where an estimated 171,000 people — or 30% of all homeless people in the U.S. — are homeless. Political leaders are divided over how to address the crisis, with some, including Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, favoring tent encampment sweeps and a tough-love approach toward those with mental health and addiction issues. It it not groundbreaking news that the state’s exorbitant housing costs are a major driver behind homelessness, but researchers hope their study will strengthen public support for policies that focus on offering housing and emergency rental assistance — rather than policies emphasizing punishment or stigma. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. \n Voters could soon get a chance to weigh in on the state’s latest approach to addressing homelessness. On Tuesday, Newsom revealed details of his plan to borrow $4.68 billion for 10,000 new treatment beds as well as community-based housing for people with severe mental health and substance use disorders. That plan would include an overhaul of a voter-approved law from 2004 that imposed a tax on millionaires to fund mental health services. \n Dr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the state’s health and human services agency, said he hopes the expansion will fill a critical need in services. But Dr. Kushel, the study’s lead investigator, said most people who are homeless and struggling with behavioral health impairments do not require intensive, in-patient treatment. Rather, she said, they need housing paired with “really robust services” and she hopes the state gets the balance right. “The root of the problem is housing, and if we want people to recover, to heal, it’s really impossible to do that when they’re homeless,” she said.  Newsom’s plan must first pass the state Legislature this year. If it does, it would go to voters in March 2024. Of those surveyed, 45% reported current, regular use of cocaine, amphetamines and opioids, or heavy episodic drinking. Some participants described how heavy substance use contributed to losing their homes, while others attributed their ability to stay alert and to protect themselves from assault or theft to methamphetamine usage. Kushel’s team surveyed nearly 3,200 adults around California, and followed up to conduct in-depth interviews with 365 people, between October 2021 and November 2022. The study found that Black people made up 26% of the homeless population in a state where they are only 6% of the general population. About 90% of participants were living in California when they became homeless. Half reported an inability to work due to age, health or disability. The median length of homelessness was a little under two years.  More than a third of adults surveyed met the criteria for chronic homelessness, meaning they had a disabling condition and were homeless for at least 1 year — or were homeless four times in the previous three years totaling more than 12 months. In Los Angeles in 2015, Sage Johnson’s mother was evicted from their apartment when she was unable to meet rent that had increased to $1,200. In disability pay, she received about $1,340 a month. She bounced around, from LA’s notorious Skid Row to various convalescent homes while her daughter lived at a shelter.  Later, Johnson, 28, was able to place her mother in a home, where she stayed for about two years. In 2018 though, her mother died from a debilitating stroke. Johnson, who now has stable housing, wishes she could have done more.  “But in the end, she did have a bed. She was inside. She didn’t have any more strokes outside. And she was able to regenerate and rejuvenate and restore some of her life while in the convalescent home,” said Johnson, a co-chair for one of the study’s advisory boards.  Nearly half of the adults surveyed were not on a lease in the six months prior to becoming homeless, and had likely moved in with family or friends, contributing to rent when they could. Nearly a quarter cited conflict among housemates, desire for more space or not wanting to impose any longer on family and friends as primary reasons they left.  On average, people surveyed who were not on leases received only one day of warning before needing to move out. Among people on rental lease agreements, more than 20% cited income loss or reduction as the primary reason they lost housing. “So it wasn’t so much that their housing costs increased, it’s that they could no longer keep up with it,” said Kushel.  California ranks as the most unaffordable state when it comes to housing, according to an annual report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. A person earning an hourly minimum wage of $15.50 would have to work nearly 90 hours a week to afford the statewide average for a modest one-bedroom rental, which is nearly $1,800 a month, the coalition states. The study was requested by Newsom’s administration, but the state did not fund it so didn’t play a role in analyzing data or interpreting the findings.  The report makes many recommendations, including expansion of rental assistance and cash assistance to struggling households, as well as pilot programs to facilitate shared housing. \n \n  \n \n Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

WESTPORT, Conn. — A dirt field overgrown with weeds is the incongruous entrance to one of America’s wealthiest towns, a short walk to a Rodeo Drive-like stretch replete with upscale stores such as Tiffany & Co. But this sad patch of land is also the physical manifestation of a broader turf war over what type of housing — and ultimately what type of people — to allow within Westport’s borders. It started when a developer known for building large luxury homes envisioned something different back in 2014 for the 2.2 acre property: a mix of single- and multifamily housing that would accommodate up to 12 families. A higher density project is more cost efficient, he said, and would allow him to sell the units for less than the typical Westport home. But the site was zoned to hold no more than four single-family houses, so he needed approval from a reluctant Westport Planning and Zoning Commission, which denied his plan. Residents erupted in fury each time he made a scaled-back proposal, and it took the developer four years after purchasing the property to win approval to build two duplexes and five single-family homes. “You are selling out Westport,” one resident yelled out as the final plan came up for a commission vote last spring. Other residents picketed commission meetings with signs reading “Zoning is a Promise.” The commission’s discussion was couched in what some would regard as code words and never directly addressed race or income. Chip Stephens, a Republican planning and zoning commissioner, voted against the plan, declaring, “To me, it’s too much density. It’s putting too much in a little area. To me, this is ghettoizing Westport.” Now under construction, these two-bedroom duplexes and single-family homes have a price tag of $1.2 million, the going rate for a home in this swanky village just outside Bridgeport and Norwalk. “We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to get this through. Would I do this all over again? No. Probably not,” said the developer, Johnny Schwartz, of Able Construction. Welcome to Connecticut, a state with more separate — and unequal — housing than nearly everywhere else in the country. This separation is by design. Westport is only one example of a wealthy Connecticut suburb that has surrounded itself with invisible walls to block affordable housing and, by extension, the people who need it. In a liberal state that has provided billions in taxpayer money to create more affordable housing, decisions at local zoning boards, the Connecticut Capitol and state agencies have thwarted court rulings and laws intended to remedy housing segregation. As far back as data has been kept, Connecticut’s low-income housing has been concentrated in poor cities and towns, an imbalance that has not budged over the last three decades. Many zoning boards rely on their finely tuned regulations to keep housing segregation firmly in place. They point to frail public infrastructure, clogged streets, a lack of sidewalks and concerns of overcrowding that would damage what’s often referred to as “neighborhood character.” An investigation by the Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica has found that more than three dozen Connecticut towns have blocked construction of any privately developed duplexes and apartments within their borders for the last two decades, often through exclusionary zoning requirements. In 18 of those towns, it’s been at least 28 years. In Westport — where gated residences overlook the Long Island Sound and voters solidly backed Democrats in the most recent state and presidential elections — private developers have been allowed to open just 65 affordable housing units over the last three decades. Public housing rentals operated by the local housing authority have also grown at a snail’s pace, with 71 new units opening in this charming small town of 10,400 homes. The impact of this logjam on families is that the share of housing specifically dedicated for low-income residents has actually decreased by small percentages in one-quarter of Connecticut’s municipalities since 1990. “I think the vestiges of our racial past are far from over,” said former Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who left office in early 2019 after eight years and regularly butted heads with General Assembly members who wanted local officials to have even more authority over housing decisions. For minority residents striving for safe and affordable housing, the state has “denied the opportunity that we allowed white middle-class aspirants to access,” Malloy said. Meanwhile, state lawmakers and bureaucrats watch from the sidelines, reluctant to intervene. This doesn’t appear likely to change any time soon. Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat from Greenwich who took office this year, declined to be interviewed for this story, but he has said his statewide goal is to “work collaboratively with the locals in terms of what they want and what they are not willing to take. At the end of the day, that community will probably take the lead on making that choice.” Lisa Tepper Bates, Lamont’s senior coordinator for housing and transit-oriented development, said in an interview that the administration hopes to bring change by adopting a “different philosophy, which is to go to the communities and try and have this discussion and try and see how far we can get.” The Cunningham family is feeling the brunt of decisions left to local zoning boards. Ashana Cunningham, a 33-year-old mother of three, lives 9 miles from Westport’s posh downtown. Each workday, she takes a bus from a homeless shelter in Bridgeport, where she lives with her family among a landscape of abandoned factories, run-down houses and trash-lined streets to her job in a suburban cornucopia a few miles away. She tends to children from privileged families at a pricey day care in Fairfield. Two days a week she works a second job at Family Dollar. This is not the life Cunningham imagined. She earned an associate degree to become a medical assistant but has never made more than $14 an hour. She and her wife struggled to pay $1,200-a-month rent for a small Bridgeport apartment, and then her wife became disabled and could not work. A car crash further complicated their lives. Cunningham was injured and left without transportation — and, ultimately, out of a job. By the time she found the day care job, which pays $12.50 an hour, the family was living in the shelter, where the smell of bleach lingers and bachata music from a neighbor’s apartment pulses through the walls. Her second job as a cashier pays $11 dollars an hour. She knows that she is trapped, that moving to a town like Westport, Trumbull or Fairfield is impossible. “There’s no other place for us to go. Fairfield or Trumbull? Forget about it,” Cunningham said. “You can’t afford to pay your rent if you are only making $707 every two weeks.” Racial and economic segregation is not unique to Connecticut, but it is extreme and runs counter to the state’s liberal image. Democrats have controlled the state legislature for 22 years and the governor’s mansion for eight. In southwest Connecticut, the gap between rich and poor is wider than anywhere else in the country. Black and Hispanic residents statewide live in some of the nation’s most segregated neighborhoods, census data shows. The repercussions of living in segregated neighborhoods often last a lifetime. “Neighborhoods matter,” researchers at Brown, Harvard and the U.S. Census Bureau concluded. The “Opportunity Atlas” they created makes clear just how much it matters by showing the stark differences in where the 20.5 million children they tracked ended up. For example, children who grew up in Cunningham’s Bridgeport neighborhood were five times more likely to be imprisoned on April 1, 2010, than those who grew up 2 miles down the road over the Fairfield line. The Bridgeport natives also made half the income of their Fairfield peers. But the families of low-income children have few housing options in Connecticut’s higher-opportunity neighborhoods: 63 of the state’s 169 municipalities have no housing authorities to facilitate the creation of public housing and manage it. In southwest Connecticut, where Cunningham lives with her family, it costs 3.5 times more to live near high-scoring elementary schools than the struggling schools her children attend, the Brookings Institution reported. “Would-be movers would have to spend about $25,000 more per year on housing to make that jump,” Brookings found. Malloy, now a visiting professor at Boston College, explained in an interview why such a large share of affordable housing that opened during his tenure was in the poorest neighborhoods. “You build where you can, where a community is inviting,” he said. “I do believe that there is not an openness and willingness to have the people who work in town, live in town. Maybe that’s because some towns want everyone to be the same. I don’t know why a town wouldn’t want a fireman or a policeman or a day care worker who works in their community to be able to live in that community.” During Malloy’s years in office, his administration directed $2.1 billion in public funding to renovate run-down public housing or build new housing so more low-income residents have an affordable place to live. The new housing was disproportionately built in the state’s poorest communities, however. Three-quarters of the new units constructed since 2011 were in the state’s 10 poorest municipalities, although only 20% of Connecticut’s housing stock is located in these communities. Just over 5% opened in the 10 wealthiest towns. Government subsidies aside, another way to bring down housing costs is to build duplexes or apartments on a lot — but that’s not being allowed in many communities, despite state law requiring local zoning commissions to “encourage” such development in order to “promote housing choice and economic diversity in housing.” While dozens of towns have not permitted any duplexes and apartments to be built in two decades, the multiunit construction in another three dozen towns just replaced similar units that had been demolished. (This new construction data only includes privately owned residential developments and not public housing, dorms or hotels.) Local zoning rules are often to blame for the lack of more affordable development. “You can’t even build a duplex. Zoning just kills it,” said Sean Ghio, policy director at the Partnership for Strong Communities, an advocacy group that lobbies for more affordable housing. “People often fear the unknown, and as a result try to keep the unknown out of their lives by maintaining the status quo. The status quo in Connecticut is living in segregated communities.” Local officials, however, say there are often legitimate reasons to deny multiunit housing because local infrastructure is not in place or there are environmental concerns. “Unfortunately, we are limited in what we can provide,” said Joyce Stille, who since 1995 has been the administrative officer of Bolton, a small town in central Connecticut that has limited sewer access and where just one duplex has received a permit in 30 years. “Because of our proximity to Vernon and Manchester, we don’t really need any [affordable housing]. They have such a wide range of options. People don’t come to Bolton because Bolton has a higher cost of living.” Only 19 cities or towns allow housing with three or more units to be built without requiring special permits, according to a 2013 review by Trinity College’s Cities, Suburbs, and Schools Project and the Connecticut Fair Housing Center. Twenty-five municipalities explicitly prohibit such housing and 123 require a special town permit. In some towns that do allow it, other zoning requirements make it exceedingly difficult for projects to come to fruition since they need more land to build anything besides a single-family home. For example, Monroe, a high-income town in southwest Connecticut, requires at least 70 acres for multifamily housing construction, and each unit may have no more than two bedrooms. A single-family home requires 1 acre. In its specially zoned “Housing Opportunity District,” 20 acres of land are required to build multifamily housing, but because of density restrictions only 13 apartments or townhomes may be built. Avon requires 15 acres for a two-unit home, compared with 1/3 acre for a single-family residence. “A large lot requirement makes it financially infeasible for such housing to be built. That’s just logic,” said Fionnuala Darby-Hudgens, who did the analysis that Connecticut’s Department of Housing used in its mandatory report to the federal government on exclusionary zoning. All of this comes 30 years after the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled for the first time that exclusionary zoning practices that quash moderate-priced housing are illegal. That groundbreaking case involved a truck driver attempting to build an affordable single-family home in middle-class East Hampton that was smaller than the minimum square feet the town required. The justices ruled against the town, saying its requirements “are a form of economic discrimination.” In the following months, state lawmakers passed a law that set the stage for the courts to review local zoning decisions in towns with few affordable homes. Most notably, the law — commonly referred to by its statutory reference as 8-30g — outlined the process for developers to bypass local zoning decisions by going through the courts if they set aside 30% of a project’s units for poor people. But the law had limited impact. Just 2% of all the housing developed in Connecticut since then is dedicated to low-income families. Since the law passed, the share of housing for low-income residents has actually decreased in 47 of the state’s 169 municipalities, according to state Department of Housing data. “Any developer who’s going to use [this law] has to be ready for the potential of a long, expensive slog, first through the zoning commission and then through the court system,” said Timothy Hollister, the land-use attorney who won the East Hampton case. He has been trying since 2005 to win approval for a client to open affordable units in Westport. Each year, legislators file a slew of bills to weaken the law. State Rep. Brenda Kupchick, a Republican from Fairfield who served as the ranking member of the legislature’s Housing Committee from 2013 to 2018, said her top committee priority is to scale back the law. “Predatory developers are taking advantage of communities, and we aren’t getting much affordable units out of it,” she said. “In 30 years, the needle hasn’t moved. It’s not working. Let’s brainstorm and come up with some ideas that may actually work.” Former Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, a Republican from Fairfield, said amending the law was a big issue for his caucus during his 16 years in the state Senate. “Look, I get the argument that you need it. You can’t let the Westports and the Greenwichs off. You have to have something. I just think there is a better way,” said McKinney, who left office in 2014 to run for governor, a bid he ultimately lost. He and Kupchick believe the state should provide financial incentives for towns that allow more affordable housing to be built within their borders. Otherwise, he said, developers game the system. “They are not really out to build affordable housing for the community. They are out to build market-rate housing, and if they have to put some affordable units with it to get approval, that’s what happens,” McKinney said. “There are developers who literally come into these meetings with two plans and say, ‘Give us this plan, or you get this affordable housing plan.’” After years of failed attempts, lawmakers in 2017 finally weakened 8-30g by making it easier for towns to get exemptions from the law’s requirements. Malloy vetoed the measure, because he said it would “perpetuate the harmful effects of bad economic policy and institutional segregation.” But the General Assembly overrode the veto. This March, the Department of Housing granted Westport — where 3.4% of the housing is considered affordable — a four-year exemption, which prevents a judge from overriding its zoning decisions. The exemption protects the town from legal challenges, but it came after the zoning commission had already approved 44 new low-income units, mostly studios or one-bedroom units with monthly rents starting at $1,400. A commissioner made it clear during project hearings that only the threat of a lawsuit under 8-30g persuaded him to approve the plans. And now that threat is gone. “The statute requires me as a commissioner to essentially pass this proposal, or give very narrow reasons for denying it, none of which were presented as evidence to this commission. So we don’t have that option. We must pass it,” said then-Commissioner Alan Hodge, a Democrat, before the 2016 vote. Westport currently has 265 units for low-income individuals that were constructed with public or private funding, though one-third of those units replaced existing affordable housing. For example, the town purchased Westport’s only trailer park and replaced its 60 mobile homes with 93 affordable apartments run by the local housing authority. What this means is that approximately 1 out of every 30 housing units in Westport is dedicated to low- or moderate-income residents, compared with 1 in 8 next door in Norwalk, or 1 in 5 in Bridgeport 9 miles away. In May, the commissioners signaled they were prepared to reject a new batch of affordable units. They say they are doing a great job developing affordable housing. “They are unnecessary,” Danielle Dobin, a Democratic commissioner, said during the panel’s discussion of the proposed units. “This commission and the commission before us have been very successful in creating so much more affordable housing in Westport.” Just over 4% of Westport residents are considered to be living in poverty — two-and-a half times less than the state’s poverty rate. Just under 1% of those who live in this town are black and 5% are Hispanic, a long way off from the state’s makeup. The Lamont administration expressed satisfaction with the current law as it stands. “8-30g is the law in Connecticut and can be one of many important tools we have to ensure that the housing our residents need is available to them,” Bates, the senior coordinator for housing and transit-oriented development, said. “The administration is seeking no changes at this time.” Asked what happens if minds can’t be changed, Bates declined to talk about next steps. “I constitutionally don’t believe that in general people’s minds can’t be changed. I think it’s a question of whether there is an effective way to engage them in discussion and conversation. I think sometimes you can go a lot further that way,” Bates said. “You know this is a new administration, so it is hard to come into it and say you are ready to beat somebody with a hammer when you haven’t had that conversation with them.” Local objections to affordable housing projects run the gamut, with developers typically facing intense zoning board scrutiny about issues like a lack of sidewalks or potential impact to the environment. Broader concerns, such as preserving a community’s character or the quality of its schools, are also frequently cited. During his State of the Town Address a few months ago, Westport’s Republican first selectman, Jim Marpe, said high-density developments keep him up at night. “The challenge to our community is not just to the character of neighborhoods, but also to firefighting and police response, potentially to educational capacity, to human services support and to our tradition as a single-family home community,” Marpe told his audience. He added, “Within the tri-state region, Westport remains an attractive and desirable location relative to many nearby communities, and we must invest in keeping our town in that position.” This mindset was on display in March, when a disgruntled Westport board discussed a proposed 187-unit apartment complex, of which 57 units would be available to low-income residents, located a half-mile from the town’s commuter train station. This developer has been trying to break ground since 2005. At one point, board members became incensed when the developer’s attorney expressed disappointment that town officials declined to meet with officials in neighboring Norwalk to negotiate changes that would need to be made so the gravel road in that city could be used for emergencies at the complex. The pathway is on land adjacent to the proposed apartment complex and would serve as a second exit that Westport officials say is necessary for emergency vehicles to access the property. Board members appeared to resent the suggestion that they take any action that would be interpreted as benefiting the developer. “I would like to put it on the record, I am vehemently opposed, disappointed and don’t understand why the town of Westport would be involved in a meeting like that,” Stephens, a planning and zoning commissioner, said. Asked why he was opposed, Stephens declined to elaborate during a recent interview, saying it’s an ongoing legal matter. When unanimously rejecting the proposed development last week, however, commissioners pointed to uncertainty about whether Norwalk would allow its gravel road to be paved and used as a second exit during emergencies. Sometimes local officials even offer money to keep affordable housing from being built. Richard Freedman, another developer who has been trying for years to build in Westport, said the town offered to purchase the land on which he proposed building 48 apartments, 29 of which would be for low-income families. “The town attorney approached my attorney to buy the property. I said: ‘It’s not for sale. We are building affordable housing,’” said Freedman, president of Garden Homes Management. Email correspondence from the developer’s attorney to town attorney Ira Bloom in October 2015 specifically rejects the town’s offer to buy the property. Bloom responds the next day with alternative locations that might be more appealing. Asked about the town’s attempt to purchase the property, Bloom said, “I don’t recall that.” He remembers conversations about finding an alternative building site for the developer, and he said he helped connect the developer with other groups interested in purchasing the property. In 2001, the town paid $4.2 million to purchase a 4-acre property adjacent to a local elementary school where only 5% of the students come from low-income families. The developer had planned to develop 60 units, of which 15 would have been dedicated for poor residents. The land is now a community garden and parking lot. Several years later, the town’s first selectman reached out to several potential buyers to facilitate the $14.5 million purchase of another property where the owner wanted to build 200 apartments by replacing a local hotel, the Westport Inn. Sixty of the units would have been for poor residents. A hotel remains there today. Even if elected officials are supportive of affordable housing, the opposition from residents can be intense. Petition drives are launched. Pamphlets are mailed. Lawn signs go up. Facebook groups are set up to strategize. Fundraising campaigns are created to pay for land-use attorneys and environmental experts. Connecticut has more law firms than any other state specializing in land use, a key indicator of restrictive zoning, the Brookings Institution reported. In Westport, a political party was established to help elect zoning commissioners who the party’s leaders believe will preserve the neighborhoods and small-town New England character. Occasionally, residents voice fear of the type of people they believe affordable housing will bring. “The drug addicts are going to be here, believe me,” William Woermer, of Branford, testified in November 2017 about a proposal to demolish a 50-unit, run-down low-income housing project for seniors and replace it with 67 units for poor families. “Retirees, disabled, old people — I have no objection to renovate the whole place and make it nice for them. But don’t get too much of that riffraff in. There will be a lot of riffraff. Then we go onto, with a project like this, you need security guards in the area.” Woermer did not respond to an interview request. In Greenwich, a public hearing in August 2017 about plans for an apartment complex next to the town’s commuter train station quickly devolved into residents complaining that low-income residents wouldn’t be able to afford to shop locally. “Nobody goes to our restaurants [if you’re] living in affordable housing,” Adam Tooter, a resident who had recently bought a $1.5 million home, said during the August hearing. Tooter did not respond to messages. Gayle DePoli, another local resident, said: “Those people won’t be able to afford to live in Old Greenwich. They won’t be able to afford to shop in King’s [gourmet grocery store]. They won’t be able to afford to eat in any restaurant but Dunkin’ Donuts and maybe grab a slice at Arcadia Pizza. They won’t even be able to afford getting a scoop of ice cream at Darlene’s.” During a recent interview, DePoli said she is opposed to the development because the area is already too congested and it is unfair to have poor people living in such high-cost areas. “It’s not about not in my neighborhood. It’s: enough in my area. It’s overbuilt with condos,” said DePoli, an independent contractor for media companies in Manhattan. “Your heart’s got to bleed a little bit for people that need low-income housing, and then you are going to put them in the middle of something they can’t afford. They can afford the rent, but what else? They aren’t going to the restaurants down there. Everything they can afford [is a car or bus ride] away. It’s pretty sad.” In March, the commissioners approved a scaled-back version of this proposed development that will have about half as many affordable apartments. The apartment will be located 2 miles from Greenwich Point, a beach restricted to residents only until the Connecticut Supreme Court in 2001 unanimously ordered the town to open it to everyone. During a zoning commission meeting in rural Oxford in 2014 for a proposed affordable housing project, the town’s first selectman expressed concern there would not be enough parking for visitors on holidays, specifically pointing to one that originated in Mexico. “I’m sure they could have their little parking spaces, but somebody throws a party, or it’s Cinco de Mayo or something else and pretty soon you can’t park there. Well, you also can’t bring an ambulance there and you can’t bring a fire engine there,” said First Selectman George Temple during a public hearing on the project, adding: “I’m not for putting slumlords into Oxford. You know, that’s perhaps an overstatement, and I am sure it is, but I am concerned about these units.” Malloy has little patience for such concerns. “Is safety genuinely 100% the fear or is there something else at play and the reason why these projects aren’t moving forward,” he said. “Let’s drill down for a second. Every one of those towns has housing on a street that doesn’t have a sidewalk. The difference being that those are single-family homes which are not affordable.” All of this pushback is code for not allowing in poor people, says Hollister, the land-use attorney. “Does anybody say we need to keep blacks and Hispanics out of Westport? No, but they talk about property values, safety and preserving open space — all the things that a town can do to prevent development that would bring up a more economically and racially diverse housing population,” Hollister said. “They don’t use the overt racial terms, but it’s absolutely clear to everybody in the room that’s what they’re talking about.” Marpe, Westport’s first selectman, disputes the idea that the town has practiced discriminatory zoning. “I have lived in many communities in the United States and I would argue Westport is as open and welcoming as any community I have ever lived in. So to cast that as an underlying principle, I would disagree,” he said during an interview. “Anyone who asserts that we don’t want anything to do with ‘those people,’ I would strongly disagree.” Marpe points to the town’s commitment to providing emergency housing for men, women and children, such as homeless shelters and halfway houses. He also points out that decisions on what gets to break ground do not rest with him alone. He cites a proposal he made early in his five and a half years in office for a private developer to build 167 units for senior citizens — 111 dedicated for low-income residents — on a 23-acre town-owned site where an abandoned mansion has sat vacant for years. That proposal was rejected by the town’s Planning and Zoning Commission and the Representative Town Meeting, Westport’s legislative body, didn’t have enough votes to override their decision. Town officials have designated the site as open space, preventing anything from being developed on the land. Marpe and Mary Young, the town’s director of planning and zoning, said there is a path for projects to make their way more easily through zoning approval. That “streamlined process” is only available, however, for those looking to build in one section of town: the highly commercialized Route 1. Winning approval outside of that zone is hard. That was the case for the developer who waited four years to build multiunit housing on the lot of a former landscaping business, which is a short distance from the high-end shopping district. “Should it have gone faster? I’m sure from anyone’s perspective, it was not streamlined. But it was not one of the processes that was enacted by my Planning and Zoning Commission. That was a developer who took his own path,” Young said. “If we’ve laid out the red carpet and asked you to come, you’re more likely to get what you need more quickly.” Stephens, the zoning commissioner, said there were legitimate reasons for the application to take so long, none of which had to do with the type of residents it would attract. “We have one of the most welcoming communities here,” Stephens said. “We go above and beyond. I would be aghast if anyone suggested differently.” Marpe said he must listen to voters. “I have to respect the fact that people who have moved here, or have grown up here and continue to live here, are here because the nature of the community is what they are looking for,” Marpe said. “So to try and change that nature with large structures maybe gets to some goal, but I don’t believe [that’s why] people who have invested in this community and want to be part of this community … came here or stayed here.” When asked if the town has, in fact, purchased or arranged for others to purchase property to keep it from being developed as affordable housing, Marpe said it is not a strategy of the town to avoid having more affordable housing. He facilitated the purchase of the Westport Inn because it’s the town’s only hotel outside a 12-room inn on the Long Island Sound, he explained. “When we have had serious storms, the Westport Inn was the one place we could offer somewhat permanent shelter,” he said. “I believe there is a need for that as well. That was the motivating factor in my mind.” Several hotels are a few miles down the road in Norwalk or Fairfield. The new developments that have been built in Westport are not meeting the demand for affordable housing. The last time the town’s housing authority opened its wait list three years ago, 1,000 people applied in 30 days. Then the waitlist closed, and it hasn’t been opened since. The housing authority still gets calls every day, including on weekends. “They come in at all hours,” said Carol Martin, the executive director of the Westport Housing Authority. “It is very much at a crisis.” Correction May 22, 2019: This story originally misstated the circumstances surrounding the rejection of a proposal to build 167 units for seniors. The Representative Town Meeting voted to approve the application, but it was short of the 2/3 vote needed to override the Planning and Zoning Commission’s rejection. The Representative Town Meeting did not reject the proposal. Lylla Younes and Beena Raghavendran contributed reporting.

But when children experience this, especially in early childhood, it can affect their health years down the line. That’s the finding of a new study in the journal Pediatrics, which says that teens who experienced housing insecurity earlier in life were more likely to report worse health. “Pediatricians, for a long time, have suspected that housing insecurity is associated with negative health outcomes,” says Dr. Hemen Muleta, a pediatrician at The Children’s Hospital at Montefiore in New York City. But this is important evidence from a longitudinal study that follows children from infancy to adolescence and connects their experiences of housing insecurity with long term health, she adds. The Future of Families and Child Well-Being study has been following a group of children across the country since their birth over 20 years ago. Researcher Kristyn Pierce and her colleague in the department of pediatrics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine mined data from that study to get a good sense of kids’ experiences with housing from birth to age 15. “We took measures of housing insecurity that were collected throughout their participation,” says Pierce. That included indicators like “homelessness, eviction, doubling up, meaning like overcrowding in the house and spending a night in a place that wasn't meant for residents and also difficulty paying for rent or mortgage.” A majority of the kids in the study – 47% – had stable housing throughout the study. “There was not one indicator [of housing insecurity] throughout their 15 years of participation,” says Pierce. A similarly large group – 46% – was what Pierce and her colleagues call “moderately insecure.” “Maybe they just had insecurity at one time point, and then were fully secure at another one,” says Pierce. “So it was sort of fluctuating and low.” The third and smallest group – 6% of the study population – had high levels of housing insecurity, especially in early childhood, but with stable housing later on. Kids with any level of housing insecurity – low or high – had worse self-reported health at age 15, says Pierce. They also reported worse mental health. “Children in both insecure groups reported higher levels of depression,” says Pierce. “And then only those in the highly insecure group reported higher levels of anxiety.” Most past studies have looked at the health impacts of housing problems in adults, says Rahil Briggs, the national director of Healthy Steps, a program that supports low income families with kids between the ages of zero and three. “This study is really important in terms of focusing our attention on teens,” says Briggs, who wasn’t involved in the new study. “Everything we know about [early] childhood is that it's the most critically important time to get your foundation right,” she adds. So it makes sense that experiencing housing instability in those early years would affect health in adolescence. This goes back to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, explains Briggs. “It's got five levels to it. And at the very, very bottom is what they call physiological needs breathing, food, water, sleep and shelter,” she says. “So just as foundational as breathing and water and food and sleep is this idea of shelter.” The absence of a safe and secure shelter creates “chronic and unrelenting” stress for the parents or caregivers, which is then picked up by kids, as well. “The acute stress of the parent and chronic stress with parents leads to dysregulation in children,” which in turn affects their development and mental health down the line. “It tells us that, you know, you need to intervene early,” says Dr. Suzette Oyeku, a pediatrician and the chief of Division of Academic General Pediatrics at Montefiore and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. That early intervention starts with screening families with young children, says Dr. Carol Duh-Leong, a pediatrician at Hassenfeld Children's Hospital NYU Langone and co-author of the new study. “As a primary care pediatrician, I'm a big believer in the primary care clinic as sort of a population health based place where we can reach a lot of children, especially young children.” Pediatricians who are part of the Healthy Steps effort already screen families with newborns up to age three several times during well-child visits . “Ninety percent of young children regularly attend well-child visits. It is the single and only setting that we have in this country to regularly reach young children in their families. Furthermore, families trust pediatricians,” Briggs says. It’s something Montefiore has also been doing. “Here at Montefiore, we screen all of our clinic pediatric patients for social needs,” says Muleta, including housing insecurity. Both at Healthy Steps clinics and at Montefiore, families who need help with housing are connected to resources in the community through a social worker or a community health worker. Montefiore’s Community Health Worker Institute, which opened in 2021, has reached more than 6,000 families with social needs, including housing, says Oyeku. However, Muleta admits that “of all the social needs that we screen for and intervene upon, I would say that housing insecurity is probably one of the most difficult and the longest to be able to resolve.” It’s a reality tied to the limited availability of affordable housing, she adds.

For most of his life, Ernest Block has managed to stay one step ahead of homelessness. When he was 9, his parents scrambled to find a new place to live after his grandmother sold the family ranch. As an adult, when his rent surpassed his income, he found friends willing to take him in as a housemate. And at other times he obtained shelter by providing live-in care for an ailing family member. Then, about 10 years ago, he found Nystrom House, in the shadow of downtown Reno’s Sands Regency Hotel Casino. The rent was affordable. For $450 a month, he had a room with a shared kitchen and bathroom. To Block, the eight-room home on Ralston Street — though aging and not the grand house it had been in its heyday — was an oasis in a busy, and often rough, neighborhood on the western edge of downtown. Fruit trees sheltered the backyard from the lights of nearby casinos. When he returned home from his job as a dishwasher, the neighborhood cat would be waiting. Block would lie on the grass and let her curl up on his chest. “I liked that place,” he said. “It felt like home to me.” In late 2016, an out-of-state casino owner, Jeffrey Jacobs, started buying up property surrounding Nystrom House: vacant land, derelict houses, historic mansions, a car repair shop, a dry cleaner, a wedding chapel, a neighborhood bar, a gas station. And motels, lots of motels. Within months, Jacobs owned Nystrom House, too. Then, as Block and his housemates watched, Jacobs began demolishing the motels. First the Carriage Inn and Donner Inn Motel. Then the Stardust Lodge. Next, the Keno, El Ray and Star of Reno fell. The motels, decades past their prime, had served as housing of last resort for hundreds of people with extremely low incomes and few other options. Jacobs was clearing the way for what he said will be a $1.8 billion entertainment district anchored by his two casinos. Jacobs’ property manager called a meeting of the Nystrom House tenants one day in mid-2018. She served free barbecue and told them they would need to find new places to live. She said she’d help. Block, like hundreds of others in motels and boarding houses bought by Jacobs in the last five years, was thrust into Nevada’s brutal affordable housing shortage — a crisis that is among the most severe in the country for extremely low-income renters, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. A ProPublica investigation found that local policies and federal tax breaks have accelerated demolition of motels and other properties where extremely low-income residents live, while doing little to help those who have lost their homes. Unlike some cities, Reno has no policy to deter demolition of affordable housing, and no requirements to replace lost units. Once such housing is gone, it often stays gone. Though the Reno City Council’s strategic plan lists addressing the housing crisis as one of six goals, it doesn’t specify how many units should be built or what to do with people who’ve lost their homes. Instead they call for “partnering with other agencies” and implementing “proven approaches,” which they don’t name. City leaders have not used Jacobs’ project as leverage to increase and improve affordable housing options. They’ve been reluctant to slow what they see as an opportunity unlike any in recent history to remake the city. They’ve been enthusiastic boosters of the project, waiving requirements and making phone calls to property owners on Jacobs’ behalf. The city also has made it easier for Jacobs to profit from any development that follows his demolitions. It has deferred building permit fees and extended the time that he can use fee credits for connecting to the city sewers, meaning he can hold vacant land for longer without losing those credits. Meanwhile, a Trump-era federal tax program that applies to development in the neighborhood has created additional incentives for developers to build market-rate or luxury housing, not affordable housing. In his public rhetoric, Jacobs doesn’t leave room for the idea that the buildings he demolishes are anything but cesspools. “The motels in the area that we demolished were structures that no one should have to live in, and rented for $1,400-$1,500” a month, Jacobs said in a written response to ProPublica’s questions. (He declined an in-person interview.) Jacobs said he has spent $400,000 to relocate 280 people who lived in the properties. “There are only a couple of these properties left in the area, run by local and out of town slumlords. The increasing value of the land in the area will ultimately cause these properties to recycle into a higher and different use,” Jacobs said. But not all of the motels are slums and some charge far less than $1,400 a month. While their number is dwindling, more than 50 remain citywide. As of February, an estimated 2,550 people lived in Reno’s motels. Reno is not the only city in the region facing a shortage of low-income housing. The crisis is particularly acute in cities like Denver, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Colorado Springs and Tucson, in part, because the region started with far less public housing than the national average. From the 1930s to the 1960s, when the federal government was more focused on building public housing for the poor, Southwestern cities were in their infancy and federal resources largely went to bigger, more established cities. Today, Arizona ranks last in public housing units per 1,000 people, according to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development data. Nevada and Utah also rank near the bottom. In Reno, these dynamics are playing out across 15 blocks of downtown, where city government has allowed the demolition of nearly 600 units of last-resort housing in exchange for Jacobs’ inchoate promise of a grand $1.8 billion entertainment district. The details of what that district might eventually look like have changed repeatedly. Most recently, Jacobs has promised a hub of hotels, restaurants and condo towers — though he’s made little progress on any of it. So far, the developer has purchased more than 100 parcels, including 19 motels — 14 of which have been demolished. By 2001, Jacobs’ companies owned, controlled or had the option to purchase 10 parcels, including those containing 0 motel rooms and other housing units that have since been demolished or boarded up.  Source: Records from Washoe County Assessor’s Office Chris Zubak-Skees for ProPublica Reno officials have not taken issue with the displacement of the motels’ residents. Instead, the mayor and some council members have cheered the demolitions, even as housing advocates have pleaded with them to preserve and update the buildings or create alternative housing before turning people out of their homes. Only 326 subsidized housing units have been built in Reno during the last six years, an amount that failed to keep pace with the city’s growth. “That housing was not affordable housing. That housing was horrific,” Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve said of the buildings demolished by Jacobs. “It’s wrong to continue to say we took away people’s housing. Honestly, what happened, it needed to happen a long time ago. We let it go on way too long and subjected people to horrific conditions for a very long time and that’s what we should be ashamed of.” Much of the land purchased by Jacobs remains vacant. A few of the parcels, including where Nystrom House stood, have been converted to parking lots. Some are adorned with sculptures from the annual Burning Man event: a 35-foot polar bear made of car hoods; a 12-ton steel Mongolian warrior; a pair of dancing bumblebees in ballet slippers. Jacobs lined one recently cleared block with replicas of Reno’s historic neon signs, some bearing monikers of the demolished motels. The people who used to live in those motels refer to the row of neon replicas as the sign graveyard. Jacobs calls it the Glow Plaza. Although Jacobs appears to have helped some former tenants find new housing, some who resided in buildings he demolished have ended up living in their cars, on the banks of the Truckee River or in similarly decrepit motel rooms. In the three years since Block was forced to leave Nystrom House, he’s been shuffled from room to room by Jacobs’ property manager. His options are dwindling. He has received an eviction notice from Jacobs’ company for his current residence and is once again trying to stay one step ahead of homelessness. When Jacobs first entered the Reno market, he had begun building an empire of small casinos and gambling halls in three states. The scion of a wealthy family of Ohio real estate moguls, he also had a Cleveland redevelopment project under his belt: a riverfront entertainment complex. In 2001, Jacobs bought his first Reno property, the Gold Dust West, a small casino that catered to locals. If he had plans beyond that, he kept them quiet. But 15 years later, he used limited liability companies that shielded his identity to begin assembling land around that casino. He also brokered a $26 million deal to buy a much larger hotel and casino three blocks to the east: the Sands Regency. Since then, Jacobs has bought every parcel he could in between his casinos, using them as collateral for the $435 million in debt carried by his company, according to property records. Once he bought the Sands, Jacobs could no longer keep his acquisitions quiet. Initially, Jacobs offered few details. He simply told the public he planned to remodel the Sands Regency and build a $500 million mixed-use entertainment project called the Fountain District. The district might include up to 300 housing units, he said at the time. Even with scant details, Jacobs’ plan appealed to city leaders who had spent decades trying to remake Reno. Once the booming gambling capital of the state, the city had seen tourism, the economic lifeblood of its downtown, go into steep decline since the early 2000s. Las Vegas emerged as the country’s leading gambling resort city, and Native American casinos in California had siphoned away many regional visitors. But Jacobs saw an opportunity. “After the 2010 recession I realized that the California Native American casino impact on Reno had bottomed out and I believed that growth and opportunity lay ahead for Reno,” Jacobs told ProPublica. Today Jacobs calls his project The Neon Line District. He says the project will include hotels, restaurants and up to 3,000 housing units — 10 times the number in the original plan. There could be an outdoor amphitheater. Most recently he said he might add a zip line. In Reno, Jacobs is following the same strategy he’s used in the past: relying on public subsidies to further his development efforts. In the 1980s, while serving a term as an Ohio state lawmaker, Jacobs sponsored unsuccessful legislation to publicly finance a Cleveland stadium project he and his partners were pitching, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. Later, his family and their partners used voter-approved sin tax revenue to build Jacobs Field — now Progressive Field, home of the Cleveland Guardians, a team Jacobs’ father used to own. (After his term in the Ohio Legislature, Jacobs ran unsuccessfully for state treasurer. His campaign consultant: Roger Stone.) In the 1990s, Jacobs asked for $4 million in improvements from Columbus, Ohio, for a proposed development there. He told the Cincinnati Enquirer that he might need the city to use eminent domain to help him acquire land. That development never materialized. In Toledo, Ohio, Jacobs proposed building an entertainment district at a declining mall, saying he would need city and state financing. That project also never happened. Jacobs told ProPublica he had “conversations” with both cities about “public-private partnerships,” but a “national recession” put an end to both ideas. When he started buying motels in Reno, Jacobs began contributing to Reno council members’ campaigns, giving to those who supported his project and to the opponents of those who didn’t. Since 2017, he’s contributed $33,250 to Reno council candidates. Mayor Schieve got the majority of that money: $21,500. Jacobs also hired as his lobbyist a former Reno city council member. Referred to by some city staff as the “eighth council member,” Jessica Sferrazza has ties to key city employees and is a close friend of Schieve, a fact the mayor discloses publicly every time the council votes on Jacobs’ project. Jacobs also hired an experienced city planning lawyer, Garrett Gordon, with a long history of helping developers get their projects approved by the City Council. Jacobs and his team have won public subsidies while limiting public input. According to statements by both Jacobs and council members, many of the conversations about his project took place in private. Jacobs refused a council member’s request for a town-hall-style meeting prior to approval of his subsidy requests. And in 2018, his company withdrew support for a community-driven design plan for that part of downtown. Eventually, the city nixed the plan. Council member Jenny Brekhus said it was done at Jacobs’ request. “The assistant city manager had conversations with the Jacobs group and their consultants and told me that Jacobs did not want this planning effort because they were, quote, ‘afraid of losing control of planning in the area,’” Brekhus said. The assistant city manager told ProPublica Jacobs withdrew support for the community plan because he was worried Brekhus, a vocal critic of Jacobs, would use it to thwart his project. As a result, there has been no comprehensive effort to solicit public input on the demolitions or on how to increase affordable housing in the district. Schieve denied her support for the project has been influenced by Jacobs’ campaign contributions or choice of lobbyist. “I approve good projects. I don’t approve projects based on relationships,” she said. Those eager to see downtown rescued from decay are anxious to see construction begin. “I’m sitting there watching it like I’m across the street from Disneyland,” said one nearby property owner. “I hope something stupendous happens.” But not all property owners want to sell, even at the prices Jacobs is offering. (He paid the owners of one motel five times what they had bought it for in 2012, according to assessor records.) In these situations, Jacobs has again turned to City Hall. When Jacobs started sniffing around the Midtown Motel on West Second Street, its owner, Kathie Mead, didn’t give it much thought. She wasn’t interested in selling, leasing or signing an option agreement. In addition to providing retirement income for Mead and her husband, the Midtown Motel serves an important need in the community. A shortage of housing in Reno has driven costs higher. The vacancy rate for rentals is 1.6%, significantly tighter than the regional average of 4.4%. The national average is 5.8%. As a result, the average rent in Reno is $1,600 a month. Mead’s rooms rent for far less and have become a place for those who either can’t afford, can’t qualify for or can’t find a home in Reno’s market. She’s rented to some tenants for more than a decade and kept their rent low. Some pay as little as $650 a month. She continued to ignore calls from Jacobs and his people. But on Aug. 30, a different call came in. She recognized it as a city government phone number. She answered. “My name is Doug, and I’m with the city of Reno,” the caller said, according to Mead. Doug wanted to know if Mead would meet with him and Jacobs that Thursday on the 17th floor of the Sands. He neglected to mention his job title: city manager. “I’m really baffled with what the city of Reno has to do with this,” Mead said she told Reno City Manager Doug Thornley. “He said, ‘No, no. We set up meetings like this all the time. It’s just to get your questions answered.’” Mead refused the meeting. But the call left her unsettled. “Is this some kind of pressure? Are they telling me they are going to take my property if I don’t agree to sell to this person?” she said. In an interview with ProPublica, Thornley denied calling Mead to exert pressure to sell to Jacobs. At the request of Jacobs’ representatives, Thornley said, he had reached out to “several” property owners who had been ignoring the developer’s calls. Each one turned him down. “I have never been part of a discussion involving the Jacobs folks or another property owner on whether or not a property would, should, could be available for sale,” Thornley said. “That’s not me. That’s not my business.” Contrary to what Jacobs said about Reno motel owners, Mead hardly fits the definition of a slumlord. Her motel is not the subject of repeated code violations. And she keeps her prices low, especially for long-term tenants. Cecilia DeRush never dreamed she’d spend her retirement in a weekly motel. She used to own transmission repair shops, where she worked as both bookkeeper and transmission rebuilder. But for the past eight years, she and her partner, Karl Hager, have lived at the Midtown Motel. They pay $650 in rent for a place with a main room big enough for a bed, small couch, chest of drawers and TV stand. There’s a small kitchen, where DeRush keeps a pot of coffee brewing for Hager, who sips constantly as he watches television. The walls are decorated with artwork of Nevada’s iconic wild horses and family photos. DeRush knows Jacobs has been pushing Mead to sell. She’s confident Mead will fend him off. “If he got it, he would tear it down,” she said, shaking her head at the thought of trying to afford rent at a typical apartment on their $1,400 in monthly income. “Can he get his claws in deep enough to force her to sell? That’s the question.” Jacobs' aggressive land acquisition and ambitious plans have given Reno leverage it could use to address its crisis — largely because he wants public assistance to build the project. In exchange for his demands for discounted land, waived or delayed building fees and subsidies from future tax revenue, the city could require him to provide affordable housing. This summer, it appeared the city might do just that. An early draft of a development agreement obtained by ProPublica would have required Jacobs to make 15% of all new housing in the district affordable — a requirement that could have replaced three-quarters of the demolished housing units. In mid-October, the City Council scheduled a key vote on the development agreement that would spell out which financial and regulatory incentives Jacobs would be granted by the city and what he would do in return. That morning, dozens of people arrived at City Hall. Some wanted information about what Jacobs would build. Some thought the council should help get the entertainment district off the ground. But others were there to urge the council to better care for the people being displaced by Jacobs: Was the council willing to use its leverage with the developer to address the city’s dwindling supply of affordable housing? Four hours into the meeting, the council began discussing the agreement. Everyone who wanted to comment on the project had left. But one key figure had just arrived: Jacobs. It was a rare appearance at a public meeting for him. Wearing pressed blue jeans, a navy suit coat and a checked shirt, Jacobs took a seat in the middle of the nearly empty room. Although most of the public had departed, under the council’s rules it was required to play public comments left by voicemail. As Jacobs sat impassively, the voice of George Campagnoni filled the chambers. Campagnoni had lived in downtown’s Courtyard Inn when Jacobs bought it. At one point, Jacobs’ property manager told Campagnoni and his neighbors they’d have a year to vacate. “One month later, they’re kicking us out, telling us we had to move, we had to get out of there,” Campagnoni said. Nearly three years after they were forced out, the motel still stands, but it’s empty. That fact rankles Campagnoni, whose rent is almost 50% higher in his new room in a downtown apartment building. “They have done nothing but left vacant, dirty lots all over the city of Reno,” he said. “They do not deserve any compensation.” (During an interview later in his tiny studio apartment, Campagnoni chuckled when told Jacobs had been present to hear his comments. “Good! Good!” he said.) In early negotiations with the city, Jacobs had asked for a nearly $3 million discount on city property, but ultimately paid market rate in exchange for fewer restrictions on how he could use the land. He had also asked for $20 million of the future property tax revenue generated within his district, but set aside that request for later. At this meeting, Jacobs asked for initial approval for streetscape design elements, including special lighting, signage and skyways. He also wanted $4.7 million in credits for pedestrian amenities and more time to use $1.6 million in sewer credits earned when he demolished his motels. Usually the city gives a landowner five years after demolishing a building to reconnect new construction to the sewer system without paying any fees. Jacobs wanted 20 years, an incentive that would allow him to sit on vacant land for two decades without losing the credits. In return for any of these requests, the council could have demanded the construction of affordable housing. Instead, the city gave Jacobs nearly everything he asked for without requiring the replacement of any low-income housing. The council did reject Jacobs’ request for 20 years to use his soon-to-expire sewer credits, instead giving him an additional five years. And it added a requirement that he apply for building permits for 63 condominium units within a year. But the 15% affordable housing requirement wasn’t part of the final agreement. Jacobs had steered the city away from using the project to advance its housing goals. He declined to comment on why he didn’t agree to the affordable housing requirement in the draft development agreement. In Thornley’s view, the best way for Reno to increase its stock of affordable housing is by adopting citywide ordinances that make it easier to build new units, or by requiring all housing developers to include some affordable units, not by leveraging one project. “That would go a longer way toward development and preserving the naturally occurring affordable housing than any sort of requirement in an agreement,” Thornley said. But that has also been a challenge. In 1999, the Legislature authorized inclusionary zoning, which requires new developments to include some affordable units, but no Nevada cities have actually adopted such an ordinance. Earlier this year, lawmakers killed a bill that would have allowed cities to require developers to pay fees to fund affordable housing in lieu of requiring them to build it directly. The city of Reno has passed several smaller initiatives to address housing, such as density bonuses, which let developers build more units than zoning allows, reduced parking requirements for affordable projects and fee deferrals. Reno’s affordable housing shortage is so severe, however, that the City Council would be justified in more aggressively leveraging individual projects to address it, said Christine Hess, executive director of the Nevada Housing Coalition. “The opportunity to ask the developer to contribute truly affordable units, meaning units that have some income restrictions, would be helpful,” Hess said. “Private developers are a really important part of the solution. ... Those units don’t build themselves.” Jacobs hasn’t ignored the housing crisis entirely. He’s promised to set aside as affordable 10% of any housing his company builds and operates — for example, Renova Flats, the one motel he has renovated to market-rate housing. Renova Flats’ deed, however, doesn’t require any affordable housing or income restrictions. The only thing holding Jacobs to it is his word. Renova Flats is only 46 units, and Jacobs’ representatives have indicated he has little interest in being a residential landlord. They said he’d much rather focus on the entertainment aspects of his project and sell excess assembled land to housing developers. For those developments, his promise that 10% of the units will be affordable wouldn’t apply. Jacobs has donated $1.5 million to the Reno Housing Authority, which went toward a $13 million, 44-unit senior housing project. And Jacobs counters criticism of his housing demolition by pointing out he did not exercise an option to buy and renovate a subsidized housing project on the edge of his Glow Plaza called the Sarrazin Arms apartments. In an interview with ProPublica, Mayor Schieve said she’s wary of requiring landowners to replace demolished housing, because it could hinder development. She agreed the city should develop a better policy to help displaced residents. “I do think we have not handled it the best,” she said. But so far, she’s relied on private conversations with Jacobs and his representatives to ensure they are helping residents rather than spearheading a policy change. Federal programs still exist to encourage private construction of affordable projects and rehabilitate deteriorating housing stock — resources that cities can marshal to address shortages. But on the land assembled by Jacobs, federal policy is working against Reno’s affordable housing goals. Reno’s downtown is in a special tax zone for low-income census tracts, a designation that can promote demolition of affordable housing in favor of investment — any investment. In February 2018, city officials nominated a handful of qualifying census tracts for the then-new federal Opportunity Zone program. According to emails obtained by ProPublica, city officials put Jacobs’ land at the top of the list they sent to the governor’s office. The census tract where it’s located met the federal criteria for poverty rate and median income. The fact that projects by Jacobs and others had already been proposed for the area made it even more desirable to the governor’s office for the designation. This June, the U.S. Treasury Department certified it as an Opportunity Zone. Under Opportunity Zone rules, investors in Jacobs’ project can get a deferral and discount on paying taxes on capital gains invested in the zone. Even bigger tax breaks come in a decade, when any subsequent gains on that initial investment become tax-free. That provision could, in this case, end up working against affordable housing development. Opportunity Zones take an “agnostic” approach to investment, operating under the belief that “investment equals benefits regardless of what that investment is,” said Urban Institute senior fellow Brett Theodos. Opportunity Zones do not prioritize the social good. Because the benefit is directly proportional to the size of the investment gains, the program tends to discourage projects that won’t generate a large profit. Affordable housing development is not an enterprise that generates large profits. “Opportunity Zones are a tool, it’s like a hammer,” Theodos said. “You can use a hammer to build a house or you can use a hammer to tear one down. “Maybe that was not all high-quality housing, but until we provide an alternative, even housing of last resort is housing. It’s better than a shelter. It’s better than under a bridge.” The Opportunity Zone’s influence on Reno’s motel demolitions is reminiscent of the 1990s, when the federal government incentivized cities to demolish decaying public housing projects. The stated intent of the HOPE VI program was to “eradicate severely distressed” public housing and build subsidized units in mixed-income developments. Tens of thousands of such units were demolished across the country, while only a fraction were replaced. In Utah, housing advocates have seen a similar dynamic play out in Opportunity Zones. An established mobile home park in the city of Layton was uprooted for an incoming development, they said. “The people who live there are pretty much screwed,” said Francisca Blanc, advocacy and outreach coordinator for the Utah Housing Coalition, who refers to Opportunity Zones as “gentrification on steroids.” Housing experts refer to low-rent homes that don’t come with subsidies or rent controls — like Reno’s weekly motels — as “naturally occurring affordable housing.” Given the struggle to add affordable housing, the preservation and rehabilitation of such units is key to addressing the crisis. “In areas where there is high demand for housing, that affordability is very much at risk,” said Andrew Aurand, vice president for research at the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Because the Opportunity Zone law requires almost no public reporting, it is difficult for researchers to determine how effective the tax incentives are at spurring investment in underserved areas, Theodos said. A qualitative study by the Urban Institute found multiple barriers to “mission-oriented” projects such as affordable housing. One of them was that such projects “yield below market returns that most OZ investors appear unwilling to accept.” Previous reporting by ProPublica and others revealed that the wealthy have used political connections to designate areas with existing investments as Opportunity Zones, taking tax breaks meant to help the poor. Again, because of the lack of reporting requirements, it’s impossible to know how widespread that abuse is. Jacobs told ProPublica he is not using Opportunity Zone financing. The rules preclude casinos from receiving the tax breaks. But the designation alone makes his assembled land more valuable. Some of the developers considering buying those sites “will include OZ credits in their sources of financing,” Jacobs said. Incentives, both local and federal, that Jacobs has cobbled together have already yielded gains. In September, Jacobs sold one of his parcels for 60% more than he paid for it 18 months ago. When Jacobs moved the tenants out of Nystrom House, Block landed at the Lido Inn, which Jacobs also demolished, then at a former wedding chapel across from Jacobs’ Glow Plaza. While Block lived at the chapel, Jacobs cleared the land where Nystrom House stood. Built in 1875, it had served as a boarding house for out-of-state divorce seekers in the early 20th century and had been put on the National Register of Historic Places. That had given Block a false sense of security when he moved in. “I thought maybe this is some place that is going to be here for a while,” Block said. Rather than demolishing the house, Jacobs moved it to an empty lot next door to the chapel, where Block was living. The house still sits there: empty, resting slightly cockeyed on a temporary support structure, many of its windows shattered. With the house gone, Jacobs plowed under the fruit trees and shrubbery that had created a neighborhood oasis. “He just leveled all the properties there on that street,” Block said. “That’s the thing that made me, like, not even want to know this person. I just wish he hadn’t ever come here.” Block’s time at the chapel didn’t last. Jacobs’ property manager moved him to Renova Flats. The average rent there is $1,000 a month. The property manager gave Block a substantial discount so he could afford a room. Block paid on time and made progress paying off fees he was charged to move in. But in July, he came home from work to find a no-cause eviction notice on his door. The property manager told him the rent discount wasn’t permanent, he said. She gave him additional time to find a place and put his name on the waiting list for a room at a transitional housing project in an industrial area. Block doesn’t blame the property manager, saying she’s done her best to help. His ire rests with Jacobs. It’s “like we don’t matter,” Block said. “It just feels like we’re kinda in the way. Like they’re just trying to move people that don’t make a lot of money. But, being born and raised here, I just feel like that’s not fair. I’ve invested the time in my life to making this a better place.” Correction Dec. 10, 2021: The caption with the first image misstated the origin of the pictured bricks. They were from the demolition of the Reno Mercantile building, not piled in a dirt lot where the Town House Motor Lodge once stood.

You are free to republish it so long as you do the following:\t This article was produced in partnership with The Southern Illinoisan, which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network. When I pulled my Jeep into the Clay Arsenal neighborhood in Hartford, Connecticut, in July, I knew intuitively that I had arrived by the sights of neglect: Beautifully crafted brick homes in varying stages of decay. Boarded up buildings. A feeling of isolation in an otherwise bustling city. I had driven 1,100 miles from southern Illinois for an appointment with Josh Serrano. He was among a handful of tenants who had led a monthslong campaign to implore the city and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to take action against an absentee landlord over poor conditions. I wanted to meet Serrano because I had covered poor living conditions and seeming federal indifference in places like the Illinois cities of Cairo and East St. Louis, in my region, and he was optimistic that by speaking with one voice, a community could achieve change. I recognized Serrano’s neighborhood from online photographs. It’s what journalists would call “distressed,” a catchall word that quickly and diplomatically describes many of the places I visited this year while reporting on the affordable housing challenges facing economically struggling rural towns and midsize cities for The Southern Illinoisan, and supported by ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network. But the word distressed, as one might also describe a favorite leather jacket or piece of reclaimed furniture, has never felt like a strong enough descriptor for the virus of political indifference that plagues these places and the people who call them home. Forget the rural-urban divide. Places like Serrano’s neighborhood in Hartford and the southern Illinois region I call home are connected by a resource gap as much as or more than we are divided by geographic boundaries. Few issues make that more apparent than the nation’s affordable housing crisis. I knocked on Serrano’s door and he led a photographer and me upstairs. Serrano is 26 years old. He’s lived in this neighborhood his entire life. Before he was born, his mother moved to Hartford from Puerto Rico with his two older brothers, searching for opportunity. About 13 years ago, Serrano said his mom moved the family into a federally subsidized property, where she raised him, his brothers and four foster siblings who are cousins. It was fine at first, he said, but complaints about safety concerns went unaddressed in more recent years. A number of tenants, including his mom, were afraid to speak out because they feared losing their homes and ending up in a worse predicament, he said. Finally, Serrano said he’d had enough. Around his kitchen table, Serrano told me how he and a half-dozen of his neighbors met for hours each week over the course of months studying HUD policies, canvassing their neighborhood to gather feedback from other renters and pushing for accountability as the rats multiplied and the mold grew inside their homes. Eventually, the tenants won action from HUD. In May, the agency announced that it was ending its contract with Serrano’s landlord, and that he and the 150 families living in his building and others would receive vouchers to subsidize their rent in the private market. But it’s hard to celebrate the dismantling of a neighborhood and the loss of affordable housing, even if that’s the best of bad options. There is a shortage of subsidized four- and five- bedroom units in Hartford, the state capital, making it challenging for some larger families to find alternative rentals that will accept their vouchers, commonly known as Section 8, in the neighborhoods where they want to live. At the start of the year, my goal was to explore HUD’s failure to enforce legal standards for decent, safe, sanitary housing in apartments subsidized by federal tax dollars, particularly in regions like mine that modern-day HUD policy seems to have left behind. I visited Evansville, Indiana; Wellston, Missouri; Steubenville, Ohio; Peoria, Illinois; and Hudson, New York, and found that they are all dealing with similar challenges. What started as a simple premise brought to light much greater challenges. HUD’s oversight failures are profound, and they have left thousands of children and their families, seniors and people with disabilities living in unsafe housing for years. As landlords have slapped paint over mold, cardboard over holes, and hid problems behind walls and “Do Not Enter” signs, the agency has often looked the other way. But these failures are symptomatic of much broader problems. To some extent, HUD has been put in an impossible position, starved for years by congressional budget cuts and lacking adequate staffing levels to monitor public and private landlords. Republicans have spent years eviscerating HUD, beginning with the Reagan administration and accelerating after the GOP won control of Congress in 1994, promising to rein in spending on social welfare programs. Chronic underfunding has persisted since then, especially for programs that fund public housing authorities. More recently, some have blamed HUD Secretary Ben Carson, trained as a neurosurgeon, as problems deepened, and his administration has done little to dislodge the inertia. But few Democratic politicians have publicly championed public housing or prioritized HUD either. As buildings age, HUD is increasingly looking to the private sector to fund a backlog of repairs and to provide new affordable units, and the agency has offered few solutions to those places that cannot attract private landlords to replace what’s being lost to neglect. These policies are based on the belief that housing should follow the economy, thereby encouraging low-income families to move into areas with more opportunities for jobs and education. While that makes for a great political pitch, it infrequently plays out that way in reality. The shortcomings of this push toward privatization are felt most in struggling rural towns and midsize cities — the places that rely the most heavily on HUD. This allows old, unsafe housing to deteriorate beyond the point of repair. In the midst of a nationwide affordable housing crisis, the agency is sometimes forced to choose between looking the other way despite knowledge of unsafe conditions or forcing tenants to leave and find their way in a tight housing market with few better alternatives. This has paralyzed HUD, forcing agency officials to run from one embarrassing oversight failure to the next instead of creating systems and policies that proactively improve access to affordable housing. Just last month, HUD told city officials in Wellston that it planned to dissolve the housing authority on Jan. 1, and then demolish or sell all of its public housing units. Nearly a fifth of Wellston’s 2,300 citizens live in public housing. Behind closed doors, a senior HUD official told Wellston’s council members that it was a tough decision to make, but that the federal government isn’t investing in public housing like it once did. When Carson visited Cairo in August 2017, four months after agency officials told families their 1940s-era apartments would be torn down and not replaced, he told tenants that it “seems unfair” that people have to suffer the consequences of past failures, “but that’s the world we live in. There’s a lot of unfairness in the world.” But unfairness implies some sort of bad luck beyond one’s circumstances, like a person who has never smoked but is diagnosed with lung cancer. The housing challenges in evidence today are solvable, advocates say, and ignoring them amounts to injustice. As my year working with ProPublica draws to a close, I’m left with more questions than answers. Among them: Why will HUD officials only acknowledge what’s happening to their agency and the people they serve behind closed doors? Why are so few people aware that the dismantling of HUD over many years is having a devastating effect on communities? When will politicians stop pretending they are surprised and outraged by massive housing failures from Cairo to New York after decades of funding and staff cuts and indifference? As I left Hartford, I wondered what would become of Serrano and his neighborhood. Several months later, Serrano told me by phone that he’d found another place nearby. He started working part time for the neighborhood advocacy organization that helped him and the other tenants organize, and he hopes to be able to pass on what he learned to others in similar situations. “I’m not trying to sugarcoat it,” he said of the neighborhood’s challenges, including crime. “But what people don’t see is the other side of it: the love out here, the care we take of each other.” Molly Parker is an investigative reporter, focusing on public housing, for The Southern Illinoisan.

State officials say a lack of affordable housing is behind a sharp rise in chronic homelessness. When Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass campaigned last year on reining in homelessness, she laid out bold proposals with a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars. In April, she told NPR she hoped for a \"very significant reduction\" this year, especially of people living on the street. But on Monday, Bass said it's become clear that there's simply no end in sight.  \"We really need to normalize the fact, unfortunately, that we're living in a crisis,\" she said at a press conference announcing a renewal of her emergency declaration on homelessness. The shift in tone comes after both LA and New York City recently declared a record level of homelessness, and other cities have also seen their numbers continue to climb despite considerable attention and spending to give people shelter. It's part of a steady rise around the country since 2016, after years of successfully driving down the number of people without housing.   So what's going on? Advocacy groups and researchers say a big driving force is the decline of affordable housing, a problem decades in the making but one that has grown significantly worse in the past few years. Here are a few ways it's playing out.  About a third of the U.S. homeless population is in California, and the state faces mounting questions about why billions of dollars spent in recent years hasn't reduced the number of people living in cars and encampments. A bipartisan group of lawmakers has asked the state auditor to investigate. A key program in Los Angeles to move people from hotels into permanent housing appears to be struggling. CalMatters reports that officials across the state are asking how they can do better, even traveling to Texas for guidance.   And yet, those in California and other places around the country can also argue they are helping more people than ever. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority says it has placed more than 20,000 into permanent housing for five years in a row — a significant boost from a decade ago — and that it's doing this faster than it has in the past. Nationally over that time, the inventory of permanent housing available has increased 26% — and it's more than doubled since 2007. \"We've done a lot\" to improve how people are placed into housing, says Steve Berg, chief policy officer at the National Alliance to End Homelessness. But he says that's only half the equation. \"The other half is people losing their housing ... and we have not had any kind of extensive or organized effort on that,\" he says.   The upshot is that, in Los Angeles and elsewhere, even as record numbers of people are being housed, a greater number of them are falling into homelessness.   Berg says one key reason is that only 1 in 4 Americans who qualify for a federal housing subsidy actually get it, and that's been the case since he was in law school decades ago. The vast majority of low-income renters must rely on market-rate housing, but the U.S. hasn't built enough housing for more than a decade, since the market crash of 2008. And the shortage is most acute for the lowest income renters — by more than 7 million units, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.  That tight market, combined with the worst inflation in a generation last year, has led to double-digit rent spikes in many places around the U.S.  A landmark new report surveyed thousands of people in California about how they came to be without housing, and researchers conducted in-depth interviews with hundreds of them. For most, high rental costs were crucial.  \"People just ran out of the ability to pay, whether it happened quickly or slowly,\" says lead investigator Margot Kushel of the University of California, San Francisco.  Some said they'd had their work hours cut. Others lost a job because of a health crisis. Many crowded in with relatives or friends, who were also likely to be poor and struggling. \"And we found that those relationships, when they fell apart, fell apart quickly,\" Kushel says. \"People only had one day's warning\" to leave. Even those with their own lease had on average just 10 days to move out.  Their median monthly household income in the six months before they became homeless was $960, she says. The median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in California is $1,700. Around the country, Kushel says, homelessness rates are highest in places where there is both poverty and high housing costs. That gap has been growing for decades, as rents have risen faster than wages. Nationally last year, the share of renters spending at least 30% or 50% of their income on housing reached a record high. And some markets have seen a major share of their low-cost rentals disappear. Over the past decade, the number of rentals under $600 fell by nearly 4 million, according to an analysis by Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. The losses happened in every state, because either rents increased, the units were taken off the rental market or buildings were condemned and demolished. Among slightly higher priced rentals, up to $1,000 a month, some 2.5 million more units were lost.   Even with inflation cooling, rents remain too high for many — and are continuing to increase in some places. Voters around the country approved spending for more affordable housing last year, and a record number of apartments are under construction. More places are also loosening zoning laws — some of which date back to segregation — to allow more multifamily buildings in residential neighborhoods. Housing experts say all this is needed to help ease the tight market and bring down prices over time. With a shortage in the millions of units, though, that could take a very long time. And in most places it's still a major challenge to build affordable housing. \"Neighbors will say, 'We don't want low-income people living here,' and they'll stop the housing from being built,\" says Berg, with the National Alliance to End Homelessness. Even housing that does get built and is billed as affordable, he says, isn't always cheap enough for those who need it most. \"It's really about having enough deeply affordable housing so that people with the lowest incomes can move into the housing,\" Berg says. \"And if they lose that housing, they can find another place to live.\" An annual count last year did find a pause in the relentless rise of homelessness. Biden administration officials, among others, credit the sweeping array of pandemic aid programs that limited evictions, helped people pay rent and boosted other financial supports. Princeton's Eviction Lab calculates such policies cut eviction filings in half. Those programs have largely ended in many places and are winding down in others. Beyond having to pay current rent, it means some people also may be expected to pay down rental debt that accumulated during the COVID-19 emergency. Many link the end of such protections to a recent rise in evictions, well above pre-pandemic levels in some places. Of course, there are other reasons. Some 19% of those surveyed in the UCSF study became homeless after leaving institutions such as prison, and finding employment and housing with a criminal record is difficult. Advocates say there's also need for more addiction and mental health treatment, though it's most effective once someone is safely housed.  But again, the overriding problem, they say, is the dire lack of places low-income people can afford to live. \"There's really no way to solve homelessness without seriously addressing this,\" says Kushel, the UCSF researcher. \"Otherwise, we're going to be compelled to continue to spend huge amounts of money managing an increasingly out of control crisis.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration is under fire for signing off on a building plan that allows a new luxury high-rise on Manhattan's western edge to have a separate entrance for low-income residents. About 20 percent of the units in the 33-story tower will be reserved for low- and middle-income residents. But all the affordable units will be grouped in one area, and those tenants will have to enter through a separate door. \"This developer must go back, seal the one door and make it so all residents go through the same door,\" City Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal said. \"It's a disgrace.\" Rosenthal is demanding an end to what some here have dubbed the \"poor door.\" Civil rights attorneys say a significant number of tenants in the subsidized apartments could be minorities. Lawyer Randolph McLaughlin says that makes the building's design more than disgraceful â€” and possibly illegal. \"To permit developers or encourage them to create separate and unequal buildings and take tax credits and benefits from the city,\" he said, \"I think that's a constitutional violation.\" The developer, Extell Development, defends the two doors, saying it complied with zoning laws by essentially creating two separate buildings. Housing advocates say Extell is exploiting a loophole in the laws, while City Hall blames the prior administration for creating those laws and approving the deal. De Blasio swept into office promising to address income inequality. \"The plans for this building were submitted and construction commenced on the project in 2013, prior to the new mayor being elected,\" said Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for housing and economic development. Extell's president, Gary Barnett, said the zoning law is aimed at creating more affordable housing. In this building, he said, the affordable units will rent for about $15 a square foot, whereas market-rate units will fetch five or six times that. \"Would you rather not have the affordable housing? Ask any one of the thousands of people who are applying for that, and they don't give a damn,\" he said. \"They want to have a beautiful apartment, in a beautiful neighborhood, and you know, at a super price.\" But some New Yorkers aren't persuaded by that super price. \"Once again we're putting segregation right upfront, and we're making it legal to segregate people,\" a caller from Queens said on WNYC's Brian Lehrer Show. On streets near the new building, it was hard to find a resident who would mind a separate entrance in exchange for a sweet, cheap rental. \"I definitely understand why people would be upset, but I would not take it too personally,\" said Roman Golubov, who lives in a subsidized apartment. \"If I had the opportunity to live in a skyscraper and I had to walk through the poor door, I'd get over it.\" Meanwhile, City Hall is trying to get over the controversy. Officials are promising a comprehensive review of the zoning laws and say they will work to close the poor-door loophole. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

She's been withholding rent in an effort to get her landlord to fix up the apartment.\n                \n                    \n                    Pam Fessler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Terrell Walker says that her apartment in Washington, D.C., has mold and problems with heating and old appliances. She's been withholding rent in an effort to get her landlord to fix up the apartment. Terrell Walker lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Southeast Washington, D.C., with her 9-year-old and 2-year-old daughters. Walker stopped paying her rent last September because, she says, her apartment is in horrible condition — and she is fighting her landlord's eviction threat in court. But when tenants don't pay, landlords say they have less money to fix things up. It is a vicious cycle that can often land the parties in court, and it's a scene that has become common around the country. The lack of affordable housing is forcing low-income renters to choose between apartments they can't afford or those that aren't in the best shape. A Frustrating Legal Process When Walker is at her job as a coach for disabled workers, her mother, Patsy Yates, watches the girls. Yates shows me the conditions of her daughter's apartment one day when she is looking after the children. \"If you sit right here by this window, like you're sitting watching TV, the wind is coming in the window so bad that you can feel it,\" Yates says. \"The bathroom is extra cold. The bedroom back there is extra cold. So I usually try to boil some water or something to try to keep it warm in here.\" But she says that's dangerous with a little child running around. \"And you don't never know when she's going to hit that stove,\" Yates says. \n                Walker's mother, Patsy Yates, shows where cold air comes in around the window frames.  She says it's so cold sometimes that she boils pots of water on the stove to help warm the apartment.\n                \n                    \n                    Pam Fessler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n The apartment is crowded for three people. In the living room, there's a bed with a bright pink comforter. The building is more than 50 years old. The baseboard heaters are falling away from the wall, although they're warm to the touch. Then, Yates has me feel around the window frames. \"You see, you feel the wind. It doesn't stay warm in here,\" she says. There is a breeze, at least where there's no newspaper stuffed into the cracks. Yates also says the appliances are old and don't work that well. In the bathroom, the tub's finish is all worn off and corroded around the drain. The landlord never glazed the tub properly, she says. \"Inspector asked them to reglaze it. He ain't done that.\" Yates says her daughter and grandchildren also had a bedbug infestation last year, which makes paying $727 a month in rent seem like an insult. A week later, Walker is at the Landlord and Tenant Branch of the D.C. Superior Court. \"I'm basically just here today to try to get justice,\" she says. It's the second time she's been in this court since her landlord sued her last November for not paying the rent. Walker has asked for a trial so she can make her case that she shouldn't have to pay until the place is fixed up. Like other tenants, Walker carries what she hopes will be evidence: a manila envelope filled with papers including lead inspection reports, photos and her handwritten list of everything she says is wrong with the apartment. \"I've complained about it and I've got nothing done,\" she says. Still, the legal process is time-consuming and frustrating. That day, there was supposed to be a hearing to decide how much money she should pay into escrow during the trial. But the landlord's witness didn't show up. After three hours, the parties agreed to postpone the hearing — but Walker had already taken off work, losing a whole day's pay. \"[That is] something that I really can't afford, for them to basically tell me that I have to come back again, you know to take off,\" she says. \"So it's like nothing really got solved today.\" That's how it often goes in the court. Few tenants have attorneys — which can put them at a disadvantage because almost every landlord has a lawyer. Landlords Need To Get Paid, Too Aaron Sokolow represents Walker's landlord. He wouldn't talk about her specific case, but he did say low-income renters aren't as powerless as it might seem, especially in Washington, where tenant protections are strong. \n                Aaron Sokolow, a Washington, D.C., real estate lawyer, works in his office. Sokolow says some tenants use complaints about poor conditions to justify not paying their rent. He says his clients need rent payments so they can pay their bills and maintain the apartments.\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Chew/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n \"In my experience, there's very little risk that a tenant will flat out lose a case because they don't understand what's going on,\" Sokolow says. Instead, some tenants have become adept at claiming housing code violations to avoid paying rent, he says. They could take their complaints to a separate housing conditions court. Instead, he says, they go to the landlord tenant branch, where they can drag the process out for months — during which time the landlord doesn't get paid. \"And that's a great frustration for a lot of my clients. They say, 'I'm not excused of my tax payment; I'm not excused of my mortgage payment,' \" Sokolow says. \"So the notion that I have to come out of pocket for 18 months of litigation, it can get very daunting, very quickly.\" \n                Art Nalls owns the Mount Dome Apartments in Southeast Washington, D.C. Nalls says he tries to provide good, decent, affordable housing but needs people to pay their rent to do that.\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Chew/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Art Nalls is a landlord with two buildings in the city. Nalls thinks it's important that low-income residents have a decent place to live. \"We try to take care of people and we try to offer good decent, affordable housing at a reasonable rate,\" he says. But if people don't pay their rent, Nalls says, it's hard to do. \"It means that I can't cover all that other stuff. So I have to call my refrigerator guy and say, 'I'm going to have to pay you next month when I get rent,' \" he says. \"It's that tight. We're not making a bazillion dollars here.\" Nalls thinks one answer is more government subsidies for low-income housing. Otherwise, he says, landlords get tired of the hassle and sell out, which can mean fewer decent, affordable housing units. According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, the number of low-cost rental units grew only 10 percent over the past decade, while the number of low-income renters grew 40 percent. Shortage Of Affordable And Safe Housing \"When I turned this on last Saturday, when I flicked this right here, electricity shot out,\" says Pamula Glover, who was showing me the thermostat in her apartment in Southeast Washington. \n                Pamula Glover points to cracks in her ceiling caused by water damage (top left) and goes through her photos on her phone of other problems in her apartment (top right). Glover, who lives with her two cats, doesn't feel safe (bottom).\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Chew/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Glover was recently in landlord tenant court with some neighbors who were being sued for not paying their rent. Glover says she has water leaks, mold and a constantly beeping fire alarm. She admits $815 a month for a two-bedroom apartment is a bargain, but she still wants to live in a place that is comfortable and safe. \"We don't even have security around here no more. They shoot around here like it's a job,\" Glover says. She says the gunfire is so bad at night she sleeps at an angle in her first-floor bedroom to stay out of the line of fire. The company that runs her apartment, Oakmont Management, refused to comment when contacted. It's being sued by the city for unlivable conditions at another apartment complex. Glover says her place has been allowed to go downhill. She grew up nearby and recalls looking at these apartments, thinking they were so nice, that if she lived in one of these buildings, she'd be rich. Glover, who lives on disability payments, says now she doesn't know where else to go. Neither does Walker, who doesn't make much above minimum wage. \n                Pamula Glover's apartment complex is located in a Washington, D.C., neighborhood plagued by gun violence.\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Chew/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Pamula Glover's apartment complex is located in a Washington, D.C., neighborhood plagued by gun violence. \"I honestly think for me, to get into a decent home with my income, it would be very hard ... because I wouldn't be able to afford it,\" she says. \"Not with the prices that they have these days.\" Anything more than $800 a month is out of her league, Walker says. But anything under $800 is pretty much what she already has. This story was produced for broadcast by Evie Stone. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

(AP) — Shirley Howard’s feet splashed into nearly a foot of water when she stepped out of bed on a summer morning last July amid a torrential rainfall.  A devastating flood swallowing up Kentucky’s Appalachian region had reached her bedroom in the night. The family grabbed their dogs and fled their brick bungalow in Jackson as the water eventually rose to the ceiling. Ten months later, they still haven’t returned home. Howard, her husband, son and their three dogs, Maisey, Charlie and Lilly, have been living in a cramped trailer provided by the state. At least 100 other families are living in trailers and hundreds more remain displaced, living with relatives or in damaged homes while they rebuild.  “I am so dying to go home every day,” the 65-year-old Howard said.  Howard’s house and nearly 9,000 others in 13 counties were severely damaged or destroyed by the intense four-day storm that dumped up to 16 inches of rain in eastern Kentucky. The fast-rising waters shoved homes off foundations, blocked roadways and submerged mountain towns under several feet of muddy water. Thousands like Howard had to grab what they could and flee. More than 40 people died.  It was one of the worst floods in Kentucky’s history, ravaging one of the poorest places in the country. Homeowners in the mountainous region settled by coal miners a century ago live in flood-prone valleys that offer the only flat land for building homes, an area already suffering a housing crisis before the flood hit. \n Disaster recovery in poor areas like this stretch of eastern Kentucky presents a host of challenges for victims who already faced setbacks before flood waters rushed inside their homes. A single inch of water inside a house can cause more than $26,000 in damage, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \n “There’s food insecurity, there’s lack of affordable housing, there’s lack of access to resources ... and those things are just exacerbated after a disaster,” said Sally Ray, director of domestic funds for the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, which helps guide private donations after disasters. The challenges in Kentucky are replicated in disasters that strike poor areas nationwide. Low-income families can’t qualify for disaster loans, and conflicting rules and separate thresholds for an array of federal aid can slow and complicate recovery, according to national experts. “They’re still recovering from Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana,” Ray said of that 2005 disaster, which flooded most of New Orleans. For a region with longstanding poverty and housing issues, Kentucky’s massive flood plunged thousands of homeowners — nearly all without flood insurance — into a deeper crisis. One study estimates it could cost nearly $1 billion to recover the region’s housing losses.  “We had a housing crisis before the flood hit,” said Scott McReynolds, executive director of the Housing Development Alliance, a nonprofit that provides housing and repairs for needy residents in southeastern Kentucky. The group was working with 400 families even before the flood. The Howards are using FEMA dollars to restore the interior of their home, since they didn’t have flood insurance, which can cost hundreds of dollars a month. “It was just too much for us,” Shirley Howard said.  Only about 5% of affected homeowners carried flood insurance, according to a report by the Ohio River Valley Institute and Appalachian Citizens Law Center. Traditional homeowner’s insurance does not cover damage caused by flooding. The report said 60% of the households damaged had annual incomes of $30,000 or less. A full housing recovery in the flood-affected region would cost an estimated $957 million, which would include moving some endangered homeowners out of flood-prone areas to avoid future costs, it said. FEMA has doled out about $106 million to victims of the Kentucky flood for repairs, cleanup, storage, moving costs and other short-term needs. The maximum FEMA payout is $39,700, but the average grant was closer to $20,000, McReynolds said. A significant federal grant of $298 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development was announced in March to fund long-term infrastructure and housing needs in the flood zone. Another $20 million was allocated earlier this year by Kentucky lawmakers, funding to be split between flood victims and people who lost their homes in a 2021 tornado in western Kentucky. But the large allocation of federal money could be slow to arrive, and it is unclear how much of it will go to housing, said Rebecca Shelton with the Appalachian Citizens Law Center, who co-authored the Kentucky flooding study. “The big concern is really the timeline,” Shelton said. “It will be many months before these (federal) funds are implemented and I don’t know how much longer folks who are still inadequately housed can hang on.”  In Jackson and surrounding communities in hard-hit Breathitt County, bare house foundations, eroded river and creek shorelines, and scattered debris are glaring signs of the destruction. Jeff Noble, Breathitt County’s top elected official, is still shocked when he speaks about the damage in his county, which was also hit by flooding in March 2021. One of his constituents has yet to find his wife’s body after she disappeared in the July flood. “It’s just unbelievable, really,” Noble said.  The Howards have been beset by delays in restoring their home. The interior has been gutted down to the wall studs; it needs flooring, electrical wiring and new drywall. They, like many in the disaster zone, have had trouble finding laborers to do the work, with at least one handyman skipping out on them. Howard is unsure their FEMA aid will be enough, with no flood insurance money coming in. Many victims who lost their homes are rebuilding again in flood-prone areas, because that’s all they can afford, McReynolds said. “We know there are a bunch of folks buying garden sheds and trying to convert them into tiny homes.” His Housing Development Alliance is among a coalition of six nonprofits that have received nearly 500 applications from flood victims wanting to build new homes, McReynolds said. Nonprofit housing groups, along with Kentucky’s governor, have their eye on a longer-term solution: moving vulnerable families out of flood-prone areas to higher ground. McReynolds said the incoming government funds could help transform the region.  Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has launched a rebuilding effort on former mining lands, to create new housing developments outside the flood zone. So far, 125 acres in two counties have been donated, and state and federal funds, along with money from flood relief donations, will help fund the effort. Officials broke ground on the first home in February. With help from McReynolds’ nonprofit, houses are also being built on a new street near Jackson. Peach Tree Street’s first resident, Deborah Hansford, moved into a two-bedroom house on higher ground in late March. She was forced out of her Jackson home by the 2021 flood, and last year’s flood walloped it again, removing any hope of returning. Last year’s disaster struck her family particularly hard. Her brother suffered a stroke as the flood waters surged and he died a month later, she said. Hansford used her FEMA assistance to make a down payment on her new house with green siding and a wide front porch. “I feel more secure now,” she said, enjoying her porch on a mild spring day. “Hopefully a flood like that will never happen again.” \n  \n Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The group wants working-class voters to lobby Congress on raising the minimum wage and taxing the rich. Late last year, people in tiny Whiteville, N.C., were recruited to weekly meetings with a group they'd never heard of. They got cold calls, flyers in the mail and in-person pitches at the local Pecan Harvest Festival. Did they want to come talk about the economy with Patriotic Millionaires? That was intriguing enough to some. \"My first thought of it was, really? They care about Columbus County? Cause nobody cares about Columbus County like that,\" says April Thomas, who has three children and works at a vape and tobacco shop. Others showed up for the freebies: door prizes, dinner and $50.  Over a month of meetings, dozens of residents got a crash course on inequality and learned why this group of rich people wants to pay higher taxes and raise the minimum wage. The nonprofit Patriotic Millionaires has lobbied Congress to make changes for more than a decade. Its members see inequality as a danger — they worry big money is corrupting politics and driving civil unrest. But they haven't had much success. President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts largely benefited the wealthy, and even when Democrats controlled the Senate in 2021, they failed to pass a bill to raise the minimum wage. \"We hit a wall,\" says Erica Payne, the group's founder. \"We have hammered them on both sides of the aisle for 12 years, OK. It's time to go to the people who hand them their power.\" Enter Whiteville, population less than 5,000. It's in a swing state where the minimum wage is still $7.25 an hour, the same as the federal rate, which hasn't been raised since 2009. The state has even barred cities from boosting their own minimums. Payne notes that low-wage workers make up more than 40% of the labor force. \"They are the most powerful people in the United States of America, if only they realized it,\" she says. Meetings in Whiteville started up again this spring. It's the pilot for an expanding push to attract more people to the cause. Patriotic Millionaires will hold gatherings soon in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and recently offered some online. \n                Many people blame themselves for their financial struggles, says Cat Hadley, who directs Patriotic Millionaires' state programs. She says the group's meetings aim to pull back the curtain and show the larger forces at work that drive inequality.\n                \n                    \n                    Jennifer Ludden/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Many people blame themselves for their financial struggles, says Cat Hadley, who directs Patriotic Millionaires' state programs. She says the group's meetings aim to pull back the curtain and show the larger forces at work that drive inequality. One afternoon in May, nearly 60 Whiteville residents trickle in to a conference room gussied up in red, white and blue. At the door there are introductions for newcomers and hugs for some regulars. This county voted overwhelmingly for President Trump in 2020, but those who show up are Republicans, Democrats and independents. They are Black and white, old and young, from seniors with walkers to people with toddlers on laps. \"Welcome everybody for coming. Will all the men remove their hats please,\" says local resident Thomas Young. Heads bow as he offers a blessing, and then people line up for the buffet dinner. Some people who attended meetings last year are back and want to use this latest round to strategize next moves. But for new recruits, once everyone's seated with a plate of chicken and green beans, Patriotic Millionaires founder Payne opens her PowerPoint to make her case. \"So 71% of Americans think the economy is rigged against them,\" she says, standing before a big screen. \"We've got news for them, they're right.\" Payne clicks through charts and graphs that she says explain the frustration many in this room are feeling. Upward mobility? It's down. CEO pay? It's gone way up, from 20 times worker pay in the 1960s to, on average, hundreds times more today. And yet, in some years major corporations essentially paid no taxes. In another graph, a squiggly line for worker productivity climbs and climbs over recent decades, while the line for wages looks almost flat. \"Where do you think all that extra productivity, the profits from all that productivity, is going?\" Payne asks. There's a murmur of responses. \"That's exactly right,\" she says. \"It's going straight into the pockets of the rich.\" Soon after, she introduces one of those rich people. \n                Patriotic Millionaires member Pierre Hollis made his fortune in stocks, income that's taxed much less than wages for actually working. He thinks if more people only knew about such tax loopholes \"they would be outraged.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Jennifer Ludden/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Patriotic Millionaires member Pierre Hollis made his fortune in stocks, income that's taxed much less than wages for actually working. He thinks if more people only knew about such tax loopholes \"they would be outraged.\" Pierre Hollis is a quiet man with a goatee, one of the millionaires who gives the group its name. He lives in Virginia and has driven down here for every one of these meetings. Hollis says Whiteville reminds him of the \"very poor town\" in Arizona where he grew up. \"But back then there was a chance of escaping the economic situation you were born into,\" he says. \"These days, that chance of escaping ... is about zero.\" In an interview before the meeting, Hollis says, \"It's obscene what the very wealthy people in this country get away with,\" and cites himself as a prime example. He made his fortune in stocks, and taxes on that income are far lower than they are for wages earned by actually working. Hollis thinks few people know about such loopholes, \"and if they knew they would be outraged.\" All these economic changes have played out so slowly that people who struggle \"assign blame on some level to themselves,\" says Cat Hadley, who directs Patriotic Millionaires' state programs. She says it's important to step back and show the larger forces at work. \"It doesn't matter who's in charge,\" she says. \"The rich people keep on getting richer and everybody else stays the same.\" \n                Jamie Insley, Brittany McMillian and April Thomas first started attending Patriotic Millionaires meetings in Whiteville, N.C., last year. They say what they've learned has helped them understand why it's become harder to make a good living.\n                \n                    \n                    Jennifer Ludden/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Jamie Insley, Brittany McMillian and April Thomas first started attending Patriotic Millionaires meetings in Whiteville, N.C., last year. They say what they've learned has helped them understand why it's become harder to make a good living. Over chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant in town, several locals say they were cautious when these meetings began. \"I am fairly conservative, have been most of my life, and so I had some preconceived notions about what I thought was going on,\" says Jamie Insley, a retired nurse. \"I've been shown quite a lot of difference.\" For one thing, he'd never considered that higher wages might benefit some businesses, since customers would have more to spend. And he had no idea how large the U.S. wealth gap has grown in recent decades. Insley gets both Social Security and veterans benefits and says he's doing fine financially. But he worries for his children because it seems harder to make a good living than when he was young. For April Thomas, what she found most striking was MIT's estimate for the local \"living wage\" for a single mother of three, like her: $53 an hour, which feels impossible. She was hired on at the vape shop at $7.25. \"[Her boss] still tries to start people at that wage, but he has trouble because a lot of people are like, 'I can't work for that.' \" Thomas recently got a bump to $10 an hour and also found another job at $15 working overnights in a group home. But it's still a financial stretch, especially with child care when she can find it. Her car's on its last legs and she can't afford another one. \"Even though I'm starting this new job, I'm not letting my old job go,\" she says. \"I'm still working it on the days that I can because this is hard. It really is.\" Brittany McMillian is also a single mom and admits the main draw at first was the free dinner. But all the information about tax loopholes and pay gaps \"opened up my eyes to a lot of things that I didn't know,\" she says. \"I want to change it for my kids and future grandkids.\" McMillian has been recruiting friends and family and says she would love to get a group big enough to take a bus to Washington, D.C. \"I feel like that — that would be amazing,\" she says. \n                Whiteville, N.C., a tiny town of about 5,000 people, is the pilot for a larger campaign to target swing-state voters. The county is solidly Republican, but Patriotic Millionaires founder Erica Payne says anger over lagging wages and inequality transcends political party.\n                \n                    \n                    Jennifer Ludden/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Whiteville, N.C., a tiny town of about 5,000 people, is the pilot for a larger campaign to target swing-state voters. The county is solidly Republican, but Patriotic Millionaires founder Erica Payne says anger over lagging wages and inequality transcends political party. As a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, Steve Rosenthal spends a lot of time dispelling misperceptions about the tax code. Compared with other rich nations, he says, U.S. spending is about average. But despite decades of rhetoric about how high taxes are, the U.S. brings in a significantly smaller share of tax revenue than those countries. And Rosenthal says a smaller part of it comes from wealthy people and corporations. \"I'm all for educating more people,\" he says about Patriotic Millionaires' grassroots push. Still, he's skeptical about the odds of success. \"I have no idea what the payoff is here.\" Rosenthal credits President Biden and many congressional Democrats for trying to raise taxes on the wealthy. Perhaps, he says, energized voters might elect more Democrats in swing states. But he's doubtful grassroots lobbying can get today's Republicans to break their \"rigid ideology\" of no new taxes. \"The Republicans have become more and more doctrinaire,\" he says, \"and there's an infrastructure to discipline Republicans that step out of line.\" It means that fiscal conservatives in the party — like Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, who both reversed themselves and raised taxes — \"are largely extinct now,\" he says. Economist Betsey Stevenson at the University of Michigan says Americans also tend to underestimate how much inequality there is in the U.S. But when it comes to lobbying on the minimum wage, there's a reason Congress hasn't raised it. \"Because the minimum wage has been raised all across the country at the state and local level,\" she says. \"And so it's just not as much of a priority because it won't affect as many people as it would have 10 years ago.\" Even in the 20 states that have not raised the minimum, like North Carolina, the tight labor market has pushed wages up some. Even so, Stevenson says there is strong public support for raising the minimum wage. But — another hurdle — lower-income Americans are far less likely to vote. She says they're hit disproportionately by voting restrictions and that casting a ballot can come at a cost. \"For some of us, giving up a day's worth of work to stand in a line to vote could mean not being able to pay your rent, or not eat,\" Stevenson says. \n                Cat Hadley (left) directs state programs for Patriotic Millionaires, and Erica Payne is the group's founder.

Hadley says their goal is not just voter turnout, but also helping working-class constituents understand that \"when you call your representative, your voice should matter and they work for you.\" The last part of the Wednesday supper meeting is devoted to helping people prepare to speak out. At a prompt, attendees pair up and ask each other to talk about their lives. A few stand to share stories of hardship, to warm applause. Then there are several rounds of role-play on how to talk to a lawmaker. In future meetings they'll get training for how to be an effective activist, start a petition on raising wages and organize a lobby day to the state Capitol. They also want to call on the U.S. congressman whose district includes Whiteville at some point.  In a wrap-up discussion, some first-time attendees say what they've learned has helped them see their own struggles differently. One man says there should be a high school class to teach kids about taxes. Darlene McCollum is one of several who say they'll be back for more sessions. \"I would love to do something so when my youngest child gets out there in the workforce,\" she says, \"he won't have to struggle like I have.\" \n                Patriotic Millionaires recruited Whiteville, N.C., residents to come to its meetings with phone calls, direct mail flyers and in-person pitches at local festivals.

        "text": "More than 40 years ago, economist John Kenneth Galbraith wrote that trickle-down economics was around in the late 1800s and was known then as horse-and-sparrow economics. The horse-and-sparrow theory posits that if you feed a horse an abundance of oats, some of the oats will pass through the horse and plop on the road for the sparrows to eat. In Galbraith’s apt but unappetizing metaphor, the ultra-wealthy and big corporations are the horse and the rest of us are the sparrows. A recent Asheville Citizen Times headline read, “Top 1% richer than the entire middle class.” According to the article, 30 years ago, the middle class — the middle 60% of American households based upon income — held twice as much wealth as the top 1%, but today the top 1% hold more wealth than the entire middle class. It seems not many oats passed through the horse and on to the sparrows. The article is based on Federal Reserve data that is available on its website. The data shows that as of mid-2023, the top 1% of Americans amassed $45.78 trillion in wealth. The ultra-elite of that group, the top one-tenth of 1% — think Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk — account for $18.63 trillion. The overwhelming majority of Americans — those in the 0-90% range — hold $45.38 trillion. In other words, the top 1% of Americans are worth more than the bottom 90%. To make the disparity even more stark, the combined wealth of the bottom half of Americans is $3.64 trillion, which is one-fifth the wealth of the top one-tenth of 1%. To put that into context, if a thousand people who are representative of wealth distribution in America were in a room, one person in the room would be worth five times more than 500 others combined. According to the Economic Policy Institute, between 1979-2021, adjusted for inflation, wages for the bottom 90% of Americans grew by 29% while wages for the top 1% soared by 206%. The top 1% controls nearly 13% of all real estate wealth and owns nearly half of all the shares in stocks and mutual funds, which are record highs. If the trend continues, the gulf between the uber rich and the rest of America will keep expanding. No one factor explains the disproportionate accumulation of wealth by the top 1%. Clearly, the Reagan-Bush-Trump tax cuts that saw most of the benefits go to those at the top exacerbated the disparity. Several years ago, billionaire Warren Buffett noted that it was unfair for his secretary to pay a higher tax rate than him and he advocated for tax reform to reduce the disproportionate burden on working Americans. Rather than reform and greater fairness, we got more tax cuts that funneled more oats to the horse, expanded the national debt, and left the sparrows standing in the road picking at the dregs. In 2021, Amazon had $35.1 billion in earnings and paid $2.1 billion in income tax, for a tax rate of 6%. Had it not been for tax breaks, Amazon would have paid $7.3 billion for a tax rate of 21%. For some reason, breaks that benefit the wealthy are lauded as “incentives” while breaks that benefit others are derided as “welfare.” Recall that Congressman Chuck Edwards opposed what he disparaged as President Biden’s “student loan giveaway plan” that would have benefited millions of ordinary Americans with up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness while our multimillionaire congressman banked $1.1 million in Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness that fattened his own wallet in true “good for me, but not for thee” fashion. The economic elites use their wealth effectively to manipulate those who aren’t rich to believe that it’s their patriotic or religious duty to vote against their own interests. They sold low wages and poor working conditions as the “right to work,” opposition to programs that help the disadvantaged as “socialism,” and tax cuts that make the rich richer and increase the national debt as magnificent trickle-down job creation wonders. Facts don’t lie, people do, and the facts prove that Galbraith’s metaphorical horse has gotten fat and bloated while the sparrows grew lean. That won’t change until the horse and the sparrows eat shoulder to shoulder rather than the horse feasting while the sparrows look up at its behind hoping that a little will pass through to them.

But economists say there's a balance.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n The Occupy Wall Street movement helped put the issue of income inequality in the spotlight. But economists say there's a balance. Income inequality is a big problem, many economists agree. But they also say some level of inequality is necessary for capitalism to work. Inequality in the U.S. has risen to levels not seen since the 1920s. The top 1 percent pocket more than 20 percent of the nation's income, and the 400 richest people in the country own more wealth than everyone in the bottom 50 percent. That's not healthy for the society or the economy, says Branko Milanovic, an economist at the City University of New York Graduate Center. For one thing, he says, it undermines the idea of equal opportunity. \"It makes some people excluded or poor and unable to actually, for example, go to school, complete studies and contribute to society,\" he says. That hurts individuals and, Milanovic says, it hurts the broader economy by not allowing a whole segment of society to be as productive as it could be. French economist Thomas Piketty has warned in his best-seller Capital in the Twenty-First Century that inequality is likely to grow. That's because capitalism tends to reward the owners of capital with a greater and greater share of the economy's output, he says. Meanwhile, wage-earners get a smaller and smaller share. Milanovic says that concentration of wealth is a threat to democracy. \"The elites start dominating the political discourse and even political decision-making, and then they reinforce their own privilege,\" he says. Still, Milanovic says some level of inequality is needed to make capitalism work. \"It provides incentives for harder work, study, investment and ... general desire to better one's condition and the condition of one's kids,\" he says. But what's the right level of inequality? Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, says whether a certain level of inequality is good or bad depends on how it came be. \"If your society has a lot of inequality because a lot of your producers have done very well selling their products on global markets, that kind of inequality is not harmful in general,\" he says. \"But if you have inequality because your poorer people don't have enough economic opportunity, I would say that is a big problem.\" Cowen thinks the big rise in incomes at the top in the U.S. is coming mostly for the right reasons. But he is concerned that incomes are stagnating for Americans in the middle and at the bottom. He believes that's partly the result of inadequate education and the high cost of health care and housing. There was a period of declining inequality in the U.S.: in the three decades after World War II. But, as Cowen points out, that happened because so much wealth and capital, like factories, were destroyed in the previous three decades by two world wars and the Great Depression. \"The relative equality following World War II was because we had destroyed so many things in the world and we needed to rebuild them, and that created a lot of middle-class jobs for people,\" he says. \"But short of having another world war, we cannot re-create those circumstances, and of course we shouldn't try to.\" But there were other reasons for a more equal distribution of income and wealth back then: higher taxes on the wealthy, for one. And, Harvard labor economist Richard Freeman says, there was another difference between then and now. \"One of the key factors in that period of time was very strong unions,\" he says. Those unions bargained with the owners of capital to give workers a larger share of the economy's output. But Freeman says we shouldn't look to unions, which are much weaker now, to have a big impact. In fact, he takes a very different tack. \"The capitalists are making money; everybody's got to be a bit of a capitalist,\" he says. That's an idea as old as America's beginnings, says Freeman. The founders, he says, thought broad ownership of land, a capital asset, was very important. \"That was being driven by the notion that if we don't make sure that everybody has an ownership stake in what was the capital of that time, we were going to end up with a class of rich people separate from the middle class, and that was not healthy for democracy,\" Freeman says. He advocates employee stock ownership and profit-sharing as tactics for closing America's inequality gap. Milanovic suggests substantial estate taxes and more equal taxation of labor and capital — currently income from labor is taxed at significantly higher levels. Cowen would focus on improving education and on making health care and housing more affordable to help people at the bottom do better. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

        "domain": "forbes.com",
        "text": "ByTommy Beer, Former Staff. New data available from the U.S. Federal Reserve shows that the wealth gap in America has widened and economic inequality increased in 2020 amidst a coronavirus pandemic that has disproportionately impacted low-wage service workers and people of color, which coincides with a report published earlier this week showing that global billionaire wealth has concurrently skyrocketed at an unprecedented rate. According to the latest Fed data, the top 1% of Americans have a combined net worth of $34.2 trillion (or 30.4% of all household wealth in the U.S.), while the bottom 50% of the population holds just $2.1 trillion combined (or 1.9% of all wealth). A study published earlier this week by Swiss bank UBS and accounting firm PwC found that the total wealth of the world’s 2,189 billionaires soared to a record-setting high of $10.2 trillion in late July, obliterating the previous record of $8.9 trillion recorded at the end of 2017. American billionaires have grown significantly richer during the pandemic, led by Elon Musk, who crossed the $100 billion benchmark in August to become the world’s fifth centibillionaire, and saw his wealth increase by 242% over the first eight months of 2020 (Jeff Bezos has added $65 billion to his net worth this year). A critical factor in the explosion of wealth among a particular segment of the U.S. population has been access and exposure to the stock market.  The Fed estimates that the wealthiest 10% of Americans hold more than 88% of all available equity in corporations and mutual fund shares (with just the top 1% controlling more than twice as much equity as the bottom 50% of all Americans combined).  The numbers have been trending in this direction for a long time. The data provided by the Federal Reserve tracks back to 1989, and it shows that over the past three decades, the top 10% of U.S. households have seen their wealth rise by almost ten percentage points (from less than 61% of all wealth to 69%), while the total wealth controlled by the bottom 50% has been cut nearly in half (from 3.6% to 1.9%). While many middle- and upper-middle-class Americans have been able to work from home and reap the rewards of a robust stock market via their retirement accounts, those near the bottom of the economic ladder have been battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed the lives of more than 210,000 Americans and served to exacerbate financial inequalities. Last week, 840,000 people filed new unemployment claims. It’s the sixth consecutive week that new claims have exceeded 800,000. A total of 25.5 million are currently receiving some form of government unemployment benefit.",

        "domain": "forbes.com",
        "text": "ByAndrew DePietro, Contributor. Income creates a disparity in every U.S. city, but the gap is markedly bigger in some areas versus others. A 2018 study by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) recently identified U.S. states, cities and counties most divided by wealth. The principal factors among many the were average income of the top 1%, the average income of the bottom 99% and the ratio of the top’s income to the bottom’s. Of the more than 900 metro areas in the EPI study, we narrowed the list down to only those with populations greater than 100,000. There are definitely some noticeable patterns. Of the top 13 metropolitan areas on the list, six of them are in Florida. Another three of the 13 are located in California. Two are located in the greater New York City metro area. And the last two don’t fall into a bucket: Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, Ark.-Mo. And Las Vegas. No cities have the exact same income discrepancy — aka top-to-bottom ratio — but the underlying problem is apparent in every one: a withering middle class.  When both ends of the income spectrum are pulled to extremes, fewer people fit into what usually is (or was) considered the biggest social class in the U.S. And this divide is widening, especially when you combine EPI’s 2018 findings with its previous income inequality study from 2016. Over those two years, from 2016 to 2018, the top 1% of earners in three cities increased their average incomes by more than 30%: North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, from $1.35 million to $1.81 million; Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, from $4.19 million to $5.59 million; and Miami, from $1.79 million to $2.34 million. Meanwhile, only one metro area saw the incomes of the bottom 99% increase by more than 20% — Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk. Instead, the incomes of the 99% increased an average of just over 11%. By comparison, the incomes of the top 1% had an average increase of 21% over the same two years.  Here are the 13 cities that exhibit the biggest wealth gaps in the study: Florida's many wealthy retirees might not be helping its income inequality. In four of its six cities that made the list, residents aged 65 and older comprise a quarter or more of the population, according to Data USA: Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, Sebastian-Vero Beach, North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, and Cape Coral-Fort Myers. Trending Now: The Best and Worst Cities to Own Investment Property  ",

        "text": "ByAndrew DePietro, Contributor. Income inequality in America is growing to alarming levels; levels of inequality not seen in the United States since the 1920s, an era romanticized for its jazz and extravagance, the so-called Roaring ‘20s, where old and new money made fortunes on the pre-SEC stock market and in an environment of negligible income taxes, anti-labor sentiment, and rural crisis, which pushed more and more poor Americans from agrarian life into the cities. Income inequality reached its peak in 1928, when the top-1%’s share of income accounted for 23.9% of all national income, according to the Economic Policy Institute.  The U.S. has now reached that same level of income inequality. From 1928 to 1973, income inequality fell as middle- and lower-class households experienced faster income growth than the top-1%. But, beginning with the economic disruptions of the 1973-1975 recession, the 1973 and 1979 oil shocks, and the double-dip recession of 1980 to early 1983, income inequality has increased year after year. The financial crash and Great Recession of the late 2000s briefly halted the growth, but since then, the upward march of income inequality has resumed.  A useful metric for gauging income inequality is the Gini index. The Gini index, or Gini coefficient, is a measure of income inequality, ranging from 0 to 1, with 0 representing perfect equality of incomes, and 1 representing maximal inequality of incomes. According to the Census Bureau’s 2020 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (the latest data available), the Gini index for the United States is 0.4817, down from 0.4823 in 2019 and 0.4822 in 2018. According to the same source, the median household income in the U.S. is $64,994. In order to identify the cities with the greatest income inequality, the study was limited to cities with populations of 50,000 or more. Read on to find out the 20 cities with the greatest income inequality in America.                                         ",

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  What brought about another decade of growing income inequality in the United States? The 2010s began and ended with pushes against inequality. The Occupy Wall Street movement made headlines back in 2011. And right now, Democratic presidential candidates are pushing ideas like a wealth tax. Even President Trump has made references to some of his supporters as forgotten Americans.The longest economic expansion in U.S. history, which began in 2009, has finally brought up wages. Yet none of this changes the numbers noticed by David Wessel, director of The Hutchins Center at The Brookings Institution. David, welcome back.DAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Good morning.INSKEEP: And happy New Year. What are you seeing in the numbers?WESSEL: Well, most people's economic fortunes did improve during the 2010s as the economy slowly climbed out of this terrible Great Recession. But by almost any measure, the gap between the people at the very top and the rest of us continued to widen. There are a couple of economists at Berkeley - Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman - who've done a lot of work on this, and they say that the income before taxes of the top 1% is now a bigger share of the pie than at any time since the 1920s.And even after you take account of federal taxes and means-tested government programs like Medicare, which take money from the top and give it to people at the bottom, the Congressional Budget Office says that the overall incomes of the bottom fifth of the population rose by 34% after adjusting for inflation during the decade. But the incomes of the top fifth rose by 58%, a lot more.INSKEEP: Now, I'm thinking of that truism about a rising tide lifting all boats. The economy seems to be lifting all boats, but some people are way above the ocean in a private jet.WESSEL: Yeah, you could say that. We know that not everybody did better during the 2010s, but we know that there were fewer people living in poverty, for instance. And we know that it was a terrific decade to be in the billionaire class.INSKEEP: What has the stock market done, if anything, to income inequality over the last decade?WESSEL: Well, the stock market had a terrific decade. The Standard and Poor's 500 was up nine of the past 10 years, and this year was particularly strong. And what that does is it tends to widen wealth inequality. Income is people's paycheck. Wealth is what they own - stocks, bonds and houses. And because the top 1% hold half of all the stock market wealth in the country, when the stock market goes up, that widens the gap between the wealthy and other people. The 130,000 households at the very top - that's the top one-tenth of 1%, the 50 million and up crowd - hold 15% of all the wealth in America, and there are a lot of Americans who have no wealth at all.But one thing that's really important to most Americans is homeownership - the value of their home, not the stock markets, their major asset. And housing prices have been rising. That's good for people who own houses, not so good for people who want to buy them. But there is one striking disparity - 73% of non-Hispanic whites own their own homes but only 43% of blacks. And that gap has been widening. Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.INSKEEP: What proposals, if any that are out there, would appear to address the root causes?WESSEL: There are things like raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, requiring Uber and Lyft and other gig employers to treat their employees differently, investing in education, nutrition, health care for low-income kids. Those all tend to reduce inequality before taxes.And we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.INSKEEP: Is there any political consensus for redistributing wealth in any way? It's a thing that some Democrats favor but that a lot of Republicans don't.WESSEL: No. I don't think there is a consensus. I think there's widespread acknowledgement that the distribution of income and wealth in America is unequal. What you often hear from people on the right is they want to focus on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. So they are interested in what can we do to give poor people a chance to build a business, go to school, make it into the middle class, and they worry less than the people on the left do about these data that we've been discussing that suggests that the inequality of outcomes has grown.INSKEEP: David Wessel, always a pleasure talking with you.WESSEL: Happy New Year, Steve.INSKEEP: Happy New Year to you.

The 130,000 households at the very top - that's the top one-tenth of 1%, the 50 million and up crowd - hold 15% of all the wealth in America, and there are a lot of Americans who have no wealth at all.But one thing that's really important to most Americans is homeownership - the value of their home, not the stock markets, their major asset. And housing prices have been rising. That's good for people who own houses, not so good for people who want to buy them. But there is one striking disparity - 73% of non-Hispanic whites own their own homes but only 43% of blacks. And that gap has been widening. Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.INSKEEP: What proposals, if any that are out there, would appear to address the root causes?WESSEL: There are things like raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, requiring Uber and Lyft and other gig employers to treat their employees differently, investing in education, nutrition, health care for low-income kids. Those all tend to reduce inequality before taxes.And we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.INSKEEP: Is there any political consensus for redistributing wealth in any way? It's a thing that some Democrats favor but that a lot of Republicans don't.WESSEL: No. I don't think there is a consensus. I think there's widespread acknowledgement that the distribution of income and wealth in America is unequal. What you often hear from people on the right is they want to focus on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. So they are interested in what can we do to give poor people a chance to build a business, go to school, make it into the middle class, and they worry less than the people on the left do about these data that we've been discussing that suggests that the inequality of outcomes has grown.INSKEEP: David Wessel, always a pleasure talking with you.WESSEL: Happy New Year, Steve.INSKEEP: Happy New Year to you.

David, welcome back.DAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Good morning.INSKEEP: And happy New Year. What are you seeing in the numbers?WESSEL: Well, most people's economic fortunes did improve during the 2010s as the economy slowly climbed out of this terrible Great Recession. But by almost any measure, the gap between the people at the very top and the rest of us continued to widen. There are a couple of economists at Berkeley - Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman - who've done a lot of work on this, and they say that the income before taxes of the top 1% is now a bigger share of the pie than at any time since the 1920s.And even after you take account of federal taxes and means-tested government programs like Medicare, which take money from the top and give it to people at the bottom, the Congressional Budget Office says that the overall incomes of the bottom fifth of the population rose by 34% after adjusting for inflation during the decade. But the incomes of the top fifth rose by 58%, a lot more.INSKEEP: Now, I'm thinking of that truism about a rising tide lifting all boats. The economy seems to be lifting all boats, but some people are way above the ocean in a private jet.WESSEL: Yeah, you could say that. We know that not everybody did better during the 2010s, but we know that there were fewer people living in poverty, for instance. And we know that it was a terrific decade to be in the billionaire class.INSKEEP: What has the stock market done, if anything, to income inequality over the last decade?WESSEL: Well, the stock market had a terrific decade. The Standard and Poor's 500 was up nine of the past 10 years, and this year was particularly strong. And what that does is it tends to widen wealth inequality. Income is people's paycheck. Wealth is what they own - stocks, bonds and houses. And because the top 1% hold half of all the stock market wealth in the country, when the stock market goes up, that widens the gap between the wealthy and other people.

Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.INSKEEP: What proposals, if any that are out there, would appear to address the root causes?WESSEL: There are things like raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, requiring Uber and Lyft and other gig employers to treat their employees differently, investing in education, nutrition, health care for low-income kids. Those all tend to reduce inequality before taxes.And we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.INSKEEP: Is there any political consensus for redistributing wealth in any way? It's a thing that some Democrats favor but that a lot of Republicans don't.WESSEL: No. I don't think there is a consensus. I think there's widespread acknowledgement that the distribution of income and wealth in America is unequal. What you often hear from people on the right is they want to focus on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. So they are interested in what can we do to give poor people a chance to build a business, go to school, make it into the middle class, and they worry less than the people on the left do about these data that we've been discussing that suggests that the inequality of outcomes has grown.INSKEEP: David Wessel, always a pleasure talking with you.WESSEL: Happy New Year, Steve.INSKEEP: Happy New Year to you.

But by almost any measure, the gap between the people at the very top and the rest of us continued to widen. There are a couple of economists at Berkeley - Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman - who've done a lot of work on this, and they say that the income before taxes of the top 1% is now a bigger share of the pie than at any time since the 1920s.And even after you take account of federal taxes and means-tested government programs like Medicare, which take money from the top and give it to people at the bottom, the Congressional Budget Office says that the overall incomes of the bottom fifth of the population rose by 34% after adjusting for inflation during the decade. But the incomes of the top fifth rose by 58%, a lot more.INSKEEP: Now, I'm thinking of that truism about a rising tide lifting all boats. The economy seems to be lifting all boats, but some people are way above the ocean in a private jet.WESSEL: Yeah, you could say that. We know that not everybody did better during the 2010s, but we know that there were fewer people living in poverty, for instance. And we know that it was a terrific decade to be in the billionaire class.INSKEEP: What has the stock market done, if anything, to income inequality over the last decade?WESSEL: Well, the stock market had a terrific decade. The Standard and Poor's 500 was up nine of the past 10 years, and this year was particularly strong. And what that does is it tends to widen wealth inequality. Income is people's paycheck. Wealth is what they own - stocks, bonds and houses. And because the top 1% hold half of all the stock market wealth in the country, when the stock market goes up, that widens the gap between the wealthy and other people. The 130,000 households at the very top - that's the top one-tenth of 1%, the 50 million and up crowd - hold 15% of all the wealth in America, and there are a lot of Americans who have no wealth at all.But one thing that's really important to most Americans is homeownership - the value of their home, not the stock markets, their major asset. And housing prices have been rising. That's good for people who own houses, not so good for people who want to buy them. But there is one striking disparity - 73% of non-Hispanic whites own their own homes but only 43% of blacks. And that gap has been widening. Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.INSKEEP: What proposals, if any that are out there, would appear to address the root causes?WESSEL: There are things like raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, requiring Uber and Lyft and other gig employers to treat their employees differently, investing in education, nutrition, health care for low-income kids. Those all tend to reduce inequality before taxes.And we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.INSKEEP: Is there any political consensus for redistributing wealth in any way?

Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.INSKEEP: What proposals, if any that are out there, would appear to address the root causes?WESSEL: There are things like raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, requiring Uber and Lyft and other gig employers to treat their employees differently, investing in education, nutrition, health care for low-income kids. Those all tend to reduce inequality before taxes.And we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.INSKEEP: Is there any political consensus for redistributing wealth in any way? It's a thing that some Democrats favor but that a lot of Republicans don't.WESSEL: No. I don't think there is a consensus. I think there's widespread acknowledgement that the distribution of income and wealth in America is unequal. What you often hear from people on the right is they want to focus on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. So they are interested in what can we do to give poor people a chance to build a business, go to school, make it into the middle class, and they worry less than the people on the left do about these data that we've been discussing that suggests that the inequality of outcomes has grown.INSKEEP: David Wessel, always a pleasure talking with you.WESSEL: Happy New Year, Steve.INSKEEP: Happy New Year to you.

The Standard and Poor's 500 was up nine of the past 10 years, and this year was particularly strong. And what that does is it tends to widen wealth inequality. Income is people's paycheck. Wealth is what they own - stocks, bonds and houses. And because the top 1% hold half of all the stock market wealth in the country, when the stock market goes up, that widens the gap between the wealthy and other people. The 130,000 households at the very top - that's the top one-tenth of 1%, the 50 million and up crowd - hold 15% of all the wealth in America, and there are a lot of Americans who have no wealth at all.But one thing that's really important to most Americans is homeownership - the value of their home, not the stock markets, their major asset. And housing prices have been rising. That's good for people who own houses, not so good for people who want to buy them.

        "text": "ByPedro Nicolaci da Costa, Former Contributor. Federal Reserve officials love singing the economy’s praises these days, throwing out terms like \"full employment\" and \"remarkably positive\" with abandon. However, new research from the Fed itself shows the health of the economy is truly in the eye of the beholder. In other words, distribution is everything. A steady economic expansion and historically low jobless rate can mask deep inequalities in income and wealth that leave American families in vastly different financial situations. The Fed’s report shows, among other things, that the poorest 50% of Americans are literally getting crushed by the weight of rising inequalities. \"The top 10% of the wealth distribution—the purple and green areas together—hold a large and growing share of U.S. aggregate wealth, while the bottom half (the thin red area) hold a barely visible share,\" Fed economists write in a paper outlining the new data set on inequality, which is more timely than exisiting statistics. The chart show that \"while the total net worth of U.S. households has more than quadrupled in nominal terms since 1989, this increase has clearly accrued more to the top of the distribution than the bottom.\" In 2018, the richest 10% held 70% of total household wealth, up from 60% in 1989. The share funneled to the top 1%’ jumped to 32% last year from 23% in 1989. \"The increase in the wealth share of the top 10% came at the expense of households in the 50th to 90th percentiles of the wealth distribution,\" the paper said. Their share dropped to 29% from over the same period. The bottom 50% saw essentially zero net gains in wealth over those 30 years, driving their already meager share of total wealth down to just 1% from 4%.",

        "text": "Michael Kazin, co-editor of the left-wing magazine Dissent, posed a simple question in a recent article: If wealth and income inequality levels are as bad as they are portrayed in popular media, “why aren’t people taking to the streets?” The statistics that describe the magnitude of economic inequality are stark. Before taking into account the effects of redistributive government programs, the richest 1% of Americans make 20% of the income. Wealth inequality is even more extreme, with a recent study estimating that in America, the wealthiest 160,000 families have as much as the poorest 145 million families. Such figures are rallying points for a specific strain of economic populism in America, manifested most saliently in the Occupy Wall Street movement. Occupy brought to the fore the idea that the nation is divided between a small group of haves and an increasingly large group of have-nots. But if this is really the case, why aren’t Americans taking to the streets? They are not rioting, or even organizing to demand that the government solve the problems of inequality. And, in fact, poll numbers suggest Americans believe the government spends too much on the poor or is otherwise too involved in the economy. Why do the statistics that supposedly describe the economic reality and Americans perceptions of that reality differ so much? For one, government programs do help—to a degree—cushion economic blows and redistribute wealth. But more importantly, the statistics that are trumpeted in much of the media do a poor job of describing the fluidity of the American economy. A study published in January by sociologists Thomas Hirschl of Cornell University and Mark Rank of Washington University paints a much more nuanced picture. They use data from the government-sponsored Panel Study on Income Dynamics (PSID), which interviewed thousands of families from 1968 through 2011 to understand how these families’ economic fortunes evolved over time. The data paints a picture of a fluid economic order. PSID data show that by age 60: – 70% of the population will have experienced at least one year within the top 20th percentile of income; – 53% of the population will have experienced at least one year within the top 10th percentile of income; and – 11.1% of the population will have found themselves in the much-maligned 1% of earners for at least one year of their lives. At the same time, it’s much more rare for a person to reach the top 1% and stay there. According to PSID data, only 0.6% of the population will experience 10 consecutive years in the top 1% of earners. The fluidity cuts both ways. Rank and Hirschl pointed out in their 2014 book Chasing the American Dream that some 45% of Americans will take advantage of a need-based welfare program, like Medicaid or food stamps, by age 60. And 54% of Americans will experience at least one year of poverty by the same age. Just because there is a good deal of changeability in America’s class structure, that doesn’t mean that everyone has the same chances at achieving high levels of income. Compared with many of its wealthy peers, there is much less inter-generational economic mobility in the U.S. If you are born poor in America, you have a much greater chance of staying poor than if you were born into the same class in places like Canada or Denmark. But in the American economy, a given individual will experience a wide array of economic circumstances throughout their lives. This is why, for instance, aspirational advertising campaigns are so effective: because millions of Americans really do climb the economic ladder over the course of their lives. This insight is also useful in politics. Liberals often marvel at the phenomenon of citizens in conservative states who vote “against their own economic interests.” But many of these people may very well have been in the top tiers of earners at some point in their lives, and they may expect to get back to that lofty perch again. Income and wealth inequality will continue to shape the world for years to come, and they are not issues the business community can ignore. But when you take a closer look at the data, you see that class in America is much more complicated than a simple story of the 1% against the 99%. Why aren’t Americans taking to the streets, ready to fight the next class war? It’s because many of us wouldn’t know which side we’re on.

        "text": "For the true believers in laissez faire economic policy, the recent and ongoing national discussion over income and wealth inequality probably seems like it was started as a cynical ploy for those on the left to gain a political advantage. After all, if rising inequality is a problem, you would be hard pressed to find any solutions offered by the right wing. It would be laughable to argue that left-leaning politicians aren’t using the issue for political advantage. But focusing on that fact alone misses one of the main reasons we have begun to pay more attention to inequality, which is the fact that we have better tools for measuring and understanding inequality than ever before. This is thanks to the work of economists like Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who have dedicated their careers to compiling and analyzing wealth and income data. Without these numbers, advocates for concerted effort to combat inequality would have no foundation for their argument. Saez and Zucman released another working paper this week, which studies capitalized income data to get a picture of how wealth inequality in America, rather than income inequality, has evolved since 1913. (Income inequality describes the gap in how much individuals earn from the work they do and the investments they make. Wealth inequality measures the difference in how much money and other assets individuals have accumulated altogether.) In a blog post at the London School of Economics explaining the paper, Saez and Zucman write: There is no dispute that income inequality has been on the rise in the United States for the past four decades. The share of total income earned by the top 1 percent of families was less than 10 percent in the late 1970s but now exceeds 20 percent as of the end of 2012. A large portion of this increase is due to an upsurge in the labor incomes earned by senior company executives and successful entrepreneurs. But is the rise in U.S. economic inequality purely a matter of rising labor compensation at the top, or did wealth inequality rise as well? The advent of the income tax has made measuring income much easier for economists, but measuring wealth is not as easy. To solve the problem of not having detailed government records of wealth, Saez and Zucman developed a method of capitalizing income records to estimate wealth distribution. They write: Wealth inequality, it turns out, has followed a spectacular U-shape evolution over the past 100 years. From the Great Depression in the 1930s through the late 1970s there was a substantial democratization of wealth. The trend then inverted, with the share of total household wealth owned by the top 0.1 percent increasing to 22 percent in 2012 from 7 percent in the late 1970s. The top 0.1 percent includes 160,000 families with total net assets of more than $20 million in 2012.  Saez and Zucman show that, in America, the wealthiest 160,000 families own as much wealth as the poorest 145 million families, and that wealth is about 10 times as unequal as income. They argue that the drastic rise in wealth inequality has occurred for the same reasons as income inequality; namely, the trend of making taxes less progressive since the 1970s, and a changing job market that has forced many blue collar workers to compete with cheaper labor abroad. But wealth inequality specifically is affected by a lack of saving by the middle class. Stagnant wage growth makes it difficult for middle and lower class workers to set aside money, but Saez and Zucman argue that the trend could also be a product of the ease at which people are able to get into debt, writing: Financial deregulation may have expanded borrowing opportunities (through consumer credit, home equity loans, subprime mortgages) and in some cases might have left consumers insufficiently protected against some forms of predatory lending. In that case, greater consumer protection and financial regulation could help increasing middle-class saving. Tuition increases may have increased student loans, in which case limits to university tuition fees may have a role to play. So, why should we care that wealth inequality is so much greater than even the historic levels of income inequality? While inequality is a natural result of competitive, capitalist economies, there’s plenty of evidence that shows that extreme levels of inequality is bad for business. For instance, retailers are once again bracing for a miserable holiday shopping season due mostly to the fact that most Americans simply aren’t seeing their incomes rise and have learned their lesson about the consequences of augmenting their income with debt. Unless your business caters to the richest of the rich, opportunities for real growth are scarce. Furthermore, there’s reason to believe that such levels of inequality can have even worse consequences. The late historian Tony Judt addressed these effects in Ill Fares the Land, a book on the consequences of the financial crisis, writing: There has been a collapse in intergenerational mobility: in contrast to their parents and grandparents, children today in the UK as in the US have very little expectation of improving upon the condition into which they were born. The poor stay poor. Economic disadvantage for the overwhelming majority translates into ill health, missed educational opportunity, and—increasingly—the familiar symptoms of depression: alcoholism, obesity, gambling, and minor criminality. In other words, there’s evidence that rising inequality and many other intractable social problems are related. Not only is rising inequality bad for business, it’s bad for society, too. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

        "title": "Could America's Wealth Gap Lead To A Revolt?",
        "domain": "forbes.com",
        "text": "ByDr. Dale Archer, Contributor. All the talk about income and wealth inequality over the last couple of years begs the question: Could the wealth gap lead to a revolt? In some ways, last week’s fast food worker strikes and rallies affecting businesses like McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Burger King, and Yum Brand’s Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC, demonstrate it already has. In 60 cities across the country, they were protesting the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour that keeps them in a chronic state of poverty, and demanding “a living wage” of twice that. It’s extremely difficult to organize workers in such a fragmented service industry, so the fact that these demonstrations have taken place on this scale is a sign of their determination. These demands have been brewing for the past year, and are likely to spread to other industries unless the government steps in to raise the minimum wage which, given the current state of Congress, is unlikely. Regardless of your personal views on the minimum wage, the protesters may have a point. The disparity between the nation’s top earners and the bottom 80 percent has grown exponentially over the past three decades, and it’s been exacerbated by the Great Recession. For all the employment growth and claims by many that our economy is in recovery, most of those new jobs – six out of ten according to the Labor Department – are on the low end of the pay scale, which is already much lower than other first world countries. Meanwhile, the top executives of the fast food companies at the center of this storm are among the highest paid in the nation. A recent YouTube video that went viral brings home just how stark the wealth gap in America has become. According to the video, almost all of us perceive the wealth distribution as unfair, and 92% of the 5,000 Americans polled think that it should be more equitable – Republicans and Democrats alike. That’s nothing new.  However, what is striking is the vast disparity between what the average American believes the wealth gap to be, and what it actually is. The reality in graphic form shows that the bottom 40% barely register, and the top 1 percent already own more of the wealth than most Americans think the top 20% should own in a fair society. Of course, we need to differentiate between wealth and income disparity. While the top 1 percent own more than 40% of the nation’s approximately $54 trillion in wealth, they earn about 19% of the income. In other words, the rich get richer via stocks, bonds, real estate, etc. which partially accounts for the wealth gap being almost double the income gap. So an increase in the minimum wage being called for now will barely make a dent in this disparity as it stands. That leaves the bottom 80 percent with a meager 7 percent of the wealth, or, to look at it another way, the wealthiest 400 Americans have the same combined wealth of the nation’s poorest – more than 150 million people, which is almost half the population. So, no matter how you slice it, when it comes to income and wealth in America, the rich get most of the pie and the rest get the crumbs. As more Americans are confronted with evidence of this stark reality, the chances of social unrest increase. In my last blog I analyzed the protests in Brazil through the lens of human behavior, and an offshoot of equity theory I call “perceived fairness”.  In essence, people are willing to make financial decisions that are not in their own best interest in order to correct an unfair situation with another person. But that is in a one on one situation. Throw in the psychology of mob mentalityand it gets much worse. So what does this say about the current economic reality of our own American pie? And how much more inequity do we need to see before the nation’s poorest, which is the vast majority, really revolt? Aristotle was the first to state that inequality triggers a revolution and that was certainly the case during the French Revolution, when onerous taxes on the lower and middle classes enhanced the lives of the wealthiest aristocrats. The American Revolution was also about unfairness. Remember the rallying cry: “no taxation without representation”? That was in response to Americans being taxed for the gain of British. The key to this not happening here and now has always been our belief in upward mobility. As long as average Americans feel they can better their lives and rise up the social and economic ladder, they will work within the system. But, more and more, we are seeing this possibility fading in America. Fortunately, we are an aspirational society, and even the poorest among us continue to dream of climbing to the next rung. As long as the power of hope remains that anyone can better their life and grab the American dream, the status quo will be intact. But, how much longer is there going to be enough of the pie for a growing segment of the middle to lower classes of the American population to split? In Part II, I’ll discuss the burgeoning group of people in this country who have little hope outside of a life that’s on state welfare, and the danger this poses to society. I'll also discuss  the Samaritan’s dilemma which dictates that, when given a hand out, there are two types of people: those who will use the helping hand to better their lot, and those who come to rely on that charity as a way of life.

        "title": "Can a (billionaire) hedge fund manager fix income inequality?",
        "domain": "fortune.com",
        "text": "On the tony Belle Haven peninsula in Greenwich, Conn., overlooking Long Island Sound, sits a massive neoclassical house that looks as if it could have been transplanted from the University of Virginia campus, the alma mater of the property’s owner: hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones II. A mansion on Greenwich’s gold coast might not be the most obvious place to go looking for solutions to America’s growing wealth gap. Yet it was there two years ago that Jones began hatching a plan to shrink the widening chasm between rich and poor.  Jones, 60, who has an estimated net worth of $4.5 billion, was having coffee one day with Deepak Chopra, the holistic medicine advocate and bestselling author, who knows the Wall Street titan through Jones’s wife, Sonia, an Australian by birth who runs a yoga and wellness business. Chopra had grown deeply concerned about income inequality. “I had been going to Occupy Wall Street meetings and saw the rage but didn’t see the solutions,” he says.  During a spirited discussion with Jones about America’s disappearing middle class, Chopra, who teaches a course at Columbia Business School called Just Capital & Cause-Driven Marketing, brought up an idea one of his students had suggested in class: create a stock market index that would drive capital to companies that treated their employees and communities well. The concept of a market-driven approach appealed to Jones, the onetime cotton trader who founded Tudor Investment Corp. in 1980, became famous by predicting the crash of ’87, and today manages $13.8 billion. “I thought, Wouldn’t this be a great thing to do?” says Jones. Jones did some quick research—and was both surprised and more than a little embarrassed to discover that taking a values-based approach to the stock market was hardly an original thought. So-called socially responsible investing, he soon learned, was a $6.6 trillion industry that had existed for decades. And yet it had never popped up on the radar of the hedge fund titan—or, Jones concluded, succeeded in putting much pressure on Fortune 500 companies to share more of their wealth with workers. That, he quips, is “a sad commentary both on the space and the space between my ears.” Then Jones had a different idea: competition. Why not rank America’s top 1,000 companies based not on what Wall Street values—profits—but rather on what Main Street wants? If the list caught on, he reasoned, companies might someday vie to be ranked higher than their rivals. And to do so they would have to pay workers more fairly, make products more sustainably, and give more back to the community. To put his plan into action, Jones earlier this year created a nonprofit called Just Capital—inspired by the title of Chopra’s Columbia course. The mission is to research what makes people like or dislike corporations and then to create an annual list—which will debut in the fall of 2016—tentatively called the Just 1000. “We want to give the American public a voice where it’s never had a voice,” says Jones. “It’s going to be crystal clear and unbiased and without prejudice. And it’s going to drive corporate behavior.” Skeptics might wonder what kind of difference a simple list can make. But Jones believes that harnessing public opinion can prove powerful—and that changing the behavior of big companies could have a cascading effect. “When we talk about moving the needle on corporate America, we’re talking about a scale that’s unrivaled anywhere else on the globe,” he says. “I actually think this has the potential to be the most impactful nonprofit that I’ve ever been involved with.” (To read about 51 companies already having a positive impact, see our Change the World list.)  In the beginning Jones will personally provide most of the funding for Just Capital, which he estimates will need about $5 million to $6 million a year to operate. But he hopes the nonprofit will eventually become self sustaining by, for instance, selling companies tools to analyze their rankings on the Just 1000 list and through licensing deals. (Think we’re a just 1000 company! decals.) To avoid conflicts of interest, Just Capital will accept no corporate donations. Jones has assembled a diverse collection of members for the Just board, which besides Deepak Chopra includes Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington; Ray Chambers, the former head of the private equity firm Wesray Capital; former Shell executive John Hofmeister; Blake Mycoskie, the founder of Toms shoes, which gives away one pair to developing countries for each that it sells; and Jochen Zeitz, the former CEO of Puma who created PumaVision, an ethical framework defined by being fair, honest, positive, and creative. What do they have in common? “They all have big hearts,” says Jones, half-jokingly. He says he is actively recruiting more former CEOs to make sure corporate America’s point of view is represented. But different perspectives won’t alter his adamant belief that the system has gotten out of balance. “There’s such an emphasis on making money that we’ve really taken the humanity out of business,” he says. “And part of the reason is that we’re not having the right value debate both in society and in our corporate boardrooms.” Jones is wellaware that many will question why a billionaire investor is suddenly so concerned about working-class families. Is it genuine? But he counters that caring about others has always been in his DNA. Jones grew up in Memphis and says his parents stressed Christian values and imbued him with a lifelong desire to give back. Jones recalls that his father, who ran a business newspaper, provided his workers with generous pensions even though his company was small. “He wanted to make sure that workers who gave their lives to his business were well taken care of,” says Jones. In 1988, Jones founded New York City’s Robin Hood Foundation, which now raises roughly $200 million a year, much of it from Jones’s hedge fund peers, to fight poverty in New York City. Last spring Jones shared his views about the need for a fairer society in a TED talk that so far has garnered more than 1.3 million online views. What attracted so many viewers was the sight of one of the richest men in the country coming right out and saying that the wealth gap is threatening America. One sound bite in particular generated a lot of buzz: “This kind of gap between the wealthiest and the poorest will get closed. History shows it usually ends in one of three ways—either higher taxes, revolution, or war. None of those are on my bucket list.” Is the situation really that dire? Just Capital board member Huffington thinks it might be. “If you look at the gun violence in Chicago, certain neighborhoods are becoming like a Third World city,” she says. “We’re seeing riots in inner-city Baltimore. What’s that about? And the fact that everything is so segregated. We don’t want to live in a country where we have to live behind gates with our children protected by guards.” Huffington worries as well that wealth inequality can lead to extreme politics. “Change will not come the same way as the French Revolution, just as I’m sure the next terrorist attack will not be like the last,” she says. “But what we’re doing is not sustainable.” Another cause for concern is America’s disappearing middle-class lifestyle. As Jones pointed out in his TED talk, when it comes to quality of life—wealth, life expectancy, literacy, social mobility, etc.—the U.S. comes in last, by a large margin, compared with 21 other developed nations. Real wages for the working class have flatlined over the past four decades, while those for the top 1% have soared. Even more troublesome: Over that period productivity has increased by 80%, which means that most gains from productivity have gone to shareholders, not employees. The Federal Reserve conducted a study that nicely sums it up: Some 47% of Americans would be incapable of paying an unexpected $400 bill without selling something or going deeper into debt. In other words, one leaky roof and you’re broke. To reverse that trend, Jones believes that companies simply must pay their employees better—which he views as a far superior way to address income inequality than raising taxes. “Look, I frankly don’t care about the level of my taxes that much,” he says. “The reason I’m generally against higher taxes is because I think our government spending is commensurately as inefficient as the tax itself. If we can redistribute through the private sector, we can have a fivefold impact compared to redistributing wealth through fiscal means.” Otherwise, some fear, we could be headed for an extreme tax hike, such as a jump to the 80% rate on income over $500,000 suggested by Thomas Piketty, the French economist and author of the recent bestselling book Capital in the Twenty-First Century. With U.S. corporate profit margins now at 11.5%, near a 40-year high, Jones believes companies can afford to share more with their employees without hurting the bottom line. As many have pointed out, companies seem to have no trouble coming up with ever-expanding compensation packages for their top executives. The AFL-CIO reported that in 2014 the average pay of a CEO was 373 times that of the average employee—multiples of what it was a few decades ago. A new rule approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission in early August will require public companies to show the total annual compensation of the CEO as a ratio compared with the average worker.  But what about a CEO’s duty to his shareholders? Jones argues that companies that treat their employees well will see better financial results over the long term. The poster child for that thinking is Starbucks (SBUX), which provides its workers with generous health benefits and recently began offering to cover the cost of an online college education. Over the past three years Starbucks’ stock has generated a total return of 156.5%, vs. 58.7% for the S&P 500. The idea that workers should receive a bigger slice of earnings has been gaining traction of late. Companies including Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), TJX (TJX), and McDonald’s (MCD) have recently announced plans to pay their employees more. At the same time cities from L.A. to Seattle to New York are planning to institute a $15 minimum wage, more than double the federal rate of $7.25 an hour. It’s a good start but not enough. Jones hopes his list will tilt the balance. Rating companies onan abstract notion like how “just” they are isn’t simple. “Coming up with a fair ranking system is what keeps me up at night,” says Jones. The list will examine criteria such as environmental sustainability, ethics of top management, and the quality and price of a company’s products. It’s likely that the results of Just Capital’s survey will show that the top concern of Americans is to be paid a living wage—no surprise there. People also care strongly about having access to quality products at an affordable price, however. That will present a challenge when issuing grades. “You’re going to have a variety of contradictions,” says Jones. “But what we’re going to do in a fastidious, detailed, and meticulous fashion is to drill down on Americans’ preferences and provide an overall ranking.” Protesters rally for higher minimum wages for fast-food workers in New York City on April 15, 2015.Photograph by Victor J. Blue—Bloomberg via Getty Images Martin Whittaker, Just Capital’s CEO, emphasizes that the nonprofit is neutral on the issues. It is merely channeling the 40,000 U.S. citizens polled in its survey, the results of which will be released in late September. “We’re not trying to advance the corporate social-responsibility agenda,” he says. “If we can simply improve transparency and information flow, companies will be motivated to be more just.” Gary Pinkus, the head of McKinsey’s North American consulting practice, which is not affiliated with the Just Capital project, believes that the Just 1000 list could have an impact if the methodology is sound. And he says the subject is front-of-mind for executives today. “Prompting this discussion would certainly help,” he says. “Our largest and most global companies are hyper-aware of what it means to operate in a way that is just and that operating only by quarterly profits will get them in trouble.” Pinkus also points out, however, that the root causes of income inequality are more complex than what corporations pay people. It also has to do with whether people have adequate education, and how fast the economy is growing. Before he wrote The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism, penned The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In the book he stressed that capitalism had to have a moral foundation to be sustainable. Otherwise the rift between the rich and the poor would lead to “the highest degree of disorder.” In a way, Jones is trying to get America back to the roots of capitalism. “Our society,” he says, “is not where we want it to be in terms of how we think of ourselves as Americans. By attacking wealth inequality we can have a more stable, stronger society.” And, he hopes, we can avoid what he fears deeply: war, revolution, and higher taxes.

        "text": "CARDIFF GARCIA, HOST: I'm Cardiff Garcia, and this is THE INDICATOR from Planet Money. Today's indicator is $52,200. That's the average income of a middle-class American household, and it's barely higher than it was even in the early 1980s. And it's today's indicator because in the same amount of time, the average income for the top 1 percent of American households has more than doubled, and it's now at 2.4 million bucks a year. By the way, we'll have a bit more on this data at the end of the show.This is what we talk about when we talk about income inequality - huge gains for the rich and stagnation for the middle class and the poor. Now, lots of people have ideas for how to get middle-class incomes growing again and for mitigating inequality. And on today's show, one of the most insightful economists I know on this topic says a lot of those ideas we've been hearing are based on what worked in the past, but they're just not going to work as well now. And he has some surprising thoughts of his own for what might actually help.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GARCIA: My guest is Branko Milanovic. He's an economist at the City University of New York and author of a book called \"Global Income Inequality\" (ph). Branko recently wrote this fascinating article arguing that economists who talk about boosting middle-class incomes remind him of generals talking about war.BRANKO MILANOVIC: You know, the economists are a little bit like, as they say, for the generals - they basically fight any current war with, I mean, the assumptions from the past war. So we are doing little bit of the same.GARCIA: Economists assume that we can boost middle-class incomes in the 21st century by doing the same things we did in the 20th century. Branko doesn't think that's going to work. And there are three specific ideas he's talking about here. The first one is getting people to stay in school longer. This was a huge thing in the 20th century. At the beginning of that century, most people didn't even graduate from high school.MILANOVIC: The gains were enormous when you went from six or eight years of education on average to 13 or 14.GARCIA: In the 21st century, more education will still help some workers, but we're not going to see the average amount of time that people spend in school double again. We can't expect most people to go to school for 25 years.MILANOVIC: You're bounded from above. There is a ceiling.GARCIA: Instead of focusing on getting people to spend more years in school, Branko says we should focus on making the quality of education more equal for everyone. He argues for getting rid of some of the tax privileges that private schools enjoy and spending more on public schools. So that's education. The second idea you hear a lot about is raising taxes. Raise taxes on the rich and maybe the upper-middle class and use that money to help the middle class and the poor. Branko says there's a few reasons that's less likely to happen now.MILANOVIC: We are limited by two forces. The first one is globalization. You cannot really tax people as much as you did in the past because they are actually much more likely to move, whether themselves physically or their capital.GARCIA: In other words, he's saying that if you raise taxes, people will either move themselves or they'll move their money. They'll just leave the country or they'll place their money in another country that's a little bit more favorable. But also, Branko says, people just don't trust the government quite as much as they used to, and so they're less likely to support tax hikes because they don't think the government will spend the money well.So we've now looked at education and at taxes. The third and last idea you hear a lot about is to find ways for unions to be important again. Their membership has been falling for more than half a century. And yes, Branko says, government policies have played a role in the decline of unions, but the government isn't the only reason for it.MILANOVIC: I think the problem is deeper, is that essentially, you have a decline of unionization in all countries, particularly in private companies - is because the nature of job have changed. Historically, we were in large factories where you have lots of people with very single, very clear objective - is to increase wages, to negotiate for that. They are really a single-issue constituency. Well, now you have - because you have many more educated people, you have a dispersed labor force. You have many more people in services in small units.GARCIA: So we're no longer in the economy of the past, where thousands of similar workers would stand side by side on assembly lines. Now we're in this new economy where people are much more spread out. They're all doing different jobs in different places. And this new world is one where we're unlikely to see the same kind of strong union growth that we had, say, 50 years ago.But Branko has a solution to this, a way for workers to make more money even without unions. Here's the idea. The income of any company is split between the owners of the company and the workers. And the point of unions was to get a bigger share for the workers. But given the decline of unions and just the fact that companies are reluctant to increase their workers' pay, Branko says that we should figure out how to turn workers into owners themselves.MILANOVIC: We really need a much more widely spread ownership of capital.GARCIA: So more shares, more stocks, more bonds, things like that.MILANOVIC: Absolutely - because those things are currently extremely concentrated in the top 1 percent or the top 5 percent.GARCIA: Branko says there are different ways you could do this. You could push companies to expand employee stock-ownership programs. You could give big tax breaks specifically targeted at middle-class investors. That might help. And there's other ideas, creative ideas that maybe we just haven't come up with yet. Look, rising inequality is obviously a really hard problem to solve, but Branko makes a compelling case. In the 21st century, just focusing on how much workers are making in salaries and benefits from their employers won't be enough to save the middle class. If the people getting ahead are the owners of capital, we have to figure out a way to help middle-class people own more capital too. And then maybe they won't go another couple of decades lagging behind the rich.(SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC SONG, \"WAKING UP TO THE FIRE\")GARCIA: By the way, we promised you an endnote about those figures we cited at the top. I know a lot of the nerds are going to be curious about this. The average middle-class wage of $52,200 is actually the average of the third quintile of income owners. And we got that from a new paper by economist Ed Wolff based on data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances. It comes out every three years. That was quite a mouthful. But the figures we used are updated through the end of 2015, and the comparison year we used was 1982. The same time period applies to the figures about the top 1 percent.

Now, lots of people have ideas for how to get middle-class incomes growing again and for mitigating inequality. And on today's show, one of the most insightful economists I know on this topic says a lot of those ideas we've been hearing are based on what worked in the past, but they're just not going to work as well now. And he has some surprising thoughts of his own for what might actually help.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GARCIA: My guest is Branko Milanovic. He's an economist at the City University of New York and author of a book called \"Global Income Inequality\" (ph). Branko recently wrote this fascinating article arguing that economists who talk about boosting middle-class incomes remind him of generals talking about war.BRANKO MILANOVIC: You know, the economists are a little bit like, as they say, for the generals - they basically fight any current war with, I mean, the assumptions from the past war. So we are doing little bit of the same.GARCIA: Economists assume that we can boost middle-class incomes in the 21st century by doing the same things we did in the 20th century. Branko doesn't think that's going to work. And there are three specific ideas he's talking about here. The first one is getting people to stay in school longer. This was a huge thing in the 20th century. At the beginning of that century, most people didn't even graduate from high school.MILANOVIC: The gains were enormous when you went from six or eight years of education on average to 13 or 14.GARCIA: In the 21st century, more education will still help some workers, but we're not going to see the average amount of time that people spend in school double again. We can't expect most people to go to school for 25 years.MILANOVIC: You're bounded from above. There is a ceiling.GARCIA: Instead of focusing on getting people to spend more years in school, Branko says we should focus on making the quality of education more equal for everyone. He argues for getting rid of some of the tax privileges that private schools enjoy and spending more on public schools. So that's education. The second idea you hear a lot about is raising taxes. Raise taxes on the rich and maybe the upper-middle class and use that money to help the middle class and the poor. Branko says there's a few reasons that's less likely to happen now.MILANOVIC: We are limited by two forces. The first one is globalization. You cannot really tax people as much as you did in the past because they are actually much more likely to move, whether themselves physically or their capital.GARCIA: In other words, he's saying that if you raise taxes, people will either move themselves or they'll move their money. They'll just leave the country or they'll place their money in another country that's a little bit more favorable. But also, Branko says, people just don't trust the government quite as much as they used to, and so they're less likely to support tax hikes because they don't think the government will spend the money well.So we've now looked at education and at taxes. The third and last idea you hear a lot about is to find ways for unions to be important again. Their membership has been falling for more than half a century. And yes, Branko says, government policies have played a role in the decline of unions, but the government isn't the only reason for it.MILANOVIC: I think the problem is deeper, is that essentially, you have a decline of unionization in all countries, particularly in private companies - is because the nature of job have changed. Historically, we were in large factories where you have lots of people with very single, very clear objective - is to increase wages, to negotiate for that. They are really a single-issue constituency. Well, now you have - because you have many more educated people, you have a dispersed labor force. You have many more people in services in small units.GARCIA: So we're no longer in the economy of the past, where thousands of similar workers would stand side by side on assembly lines. Now we're in this new economy where people are much more spread out. They're all doing different jobs in different places. And this new world is one where we're unlikely to see the same kind of strong union growth that we had, say, 50 years ago.But Branko has a solution to this, a way for workers to make more money even without unions. Here's the idea. The income of any company is split between the owners of the company and the workers. And the point of unions was to get a bigger share for the workers. But given the decline of unions and just the fact that companies are reluctant to increase their workers' pay, Branko says that we should figure out how to turn workers into owners themselves.MILANOVIC: We really need a much more widely spread ownership of capital.GARCIA: So more shares, more stocks, more bonds, things like that.MILANOVIC: Absolutely - because those things are currently extremely concentrated in the top 1 percent or the top 5 percent.GARCIA: Branko says there are different ways you could do this. You could push companies to expand employee stock-ownership programs. You could give big tax breaks specifically targeted at middle-class investors. That might help. And there's other ideas, creative ideas that maybe we just haven't come up with yet. Look, rising inequality is obviously a really hard problem to solve, but Branko makes a compelling case. In the 21st century, just focusing on how much workers are making in salaries and benefits from their employers won't be enough to save the middle class. If the people getting ahead are the owners of capital, we have to figure out a way to help middle-class people own more capital too. And then maybe they won't go another couple of decades lagging behind the rich.(SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC SONG, \"WAKING UP TO THE FIRE\")GARCIA: By the way, we promised you an endnote about those figures we cited at the top. I know a lot of the nerds are going to be curious about this. The average middle-class wage of $52,200 is actually the average of the third quintile of income owners. And we got that from a new paper by economist Ed Wolff based on data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances. It comes out every three years. That was quite a mouthful. But the figures we used are updated through the end of 2015, and the comparison year we used was 1982. The same time period applies to the figures about the top 1 percent.

He's an economist at the City University of New York and author of a book called \"Global Income Inequality\" (ph). Branko recently wrote this fascinating article arguing that economists who talk about boosting middle-class incomes remind him of generals talking about war.BRANKO MILANOVIC: You know, the economists are a little bit like, as they say, for the generals - they basically fight any current war with, I mean, the assumptions from the past war. So we are doing little bit of the same.GARCIA: Economists assume that we can boost middle-class incomes in the 21st century by doing the same things we did in the 20th century. Branko doesn't think that's going to work. And there are three specific ideas he's talking about here. The first one is getting people to stay in school longer. This was a huge thing in the 20th century. At the beginning of that century, most people didn't even graduate from high school.MILANOVIC: The gains were enormous when you went from six or eight years of education on average to 13 or 14.GARCIA: In the 21st century, more education will still help some workers, but we're not going to see the average amount of time that people spend in school double again. We can't expect most people to go to school for 25 years.MILANOVIC: You're bounded from above. There is a ceiling.GARCIA: Instead of focusing on getting people to spend more years in school, Branko says we should focus on making the quality of education more equal for everyone. He argues for getting rid of some of the tax privileges that private schools enjoy and spending more on public schools. So that's education. The second idea you hear a lot about is raising taxes. Raise taxes on the rich and maybe the upper-middle class and use that money to help the middle class and the poor. Branko says there's a few reasons that's less likely to happen now.MILANOVIC: We are limited by two forces. The first one is globalization. You cannot really tax people as much as you did in the past because they are actually much more likely to move, whether themselves physically or their capital.GARCIA: In other words, he's saying that if you raise taxes, people will either move themselves or they'll move their money. They'll just leave the country or they'll place their money in another country that's a little bit more favorable. But also, Branko says, people just don't trust the government quite as much as they used to, and so they're less likely to support tax hikes because they don't think the government will spend the money well.So we've now looked at education and at taxes. The third and last idea you hear a lot about is to find ways for unions to be important again. Their membership has been falling for more than half a century. And yes, Branko says, government policies have played a role in the decline of unions, but the government isn't the only reason for it.MILANOVIC: I think the problem is deeper, is that essentially, you have a decline of unionization in all countries, particularly in private companies - is because the nature of job have changed. Historically, we were in large factories where you have lots of people with very single, very clear objective - is to increase wages, to negotiate for that. They are really a single-issue constituency. Well, now you have - because you have many more educated people, you have a dispersed labor force. You have many more people in services in small units.GARCIA: So we're no longer in the economy of the past, where thousands of similar workers would stand side by side on assembly lines. Now we're in this new economy where people are much more spread out. They're all doing different jobs in different places. And this new world is one where we're unlikely to see the same kind of strong union growth that we had, say, 50 years ago.But Branko has a solution to this, a way for workers to make more money even without unions. Here's the idea. The income of any company is split between the owners of the company and the workers. And the point of unions was to get a bigger share for the workers. But given the decline of unions and just the fact that companies are reluctant to increase their workers' pay, Branko says that we should figure out how to turn workers into owners themselves.MILANOVIC: We really need a much more widely spread ownership of capital.GARCIA: So more shares, more stocks, more bonds, things like that.MILANOVIC: Absolutely - because those things are currently extremely concentrated in the top 1 percent or the top 5 percent.GARCIA: Branko says there are different ways you could do this. You could push companies to expand employee stock-ownership programs. You could give big tax breaks specifically targeted at middle-class investors. That might help. And there's other ideas, creative ideas that maybe we just haven't come up with yet. Look, rising inequality is obviously a really hard problem to solve, but Branko makes a compelling case. In the 21st century, just focusing on how much workers are making in salaries and benefits from their employers won't be enough to save the middle class. If the people getting ahead are the owners of capital, we have to figure out a way to help middle-class people own more capital too. And then maybe they won't go another couple of decades lagging behind the rich.(SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC SONG, \"WAKING UP TO THE FIRE\")GARCIA: By the way, we promised you an endnote about those figures we cited at the top. I know a lot of the nerds are going to be curious about this. The average middle-class wage of $52,200 is actually the average of the third quintile of income owners. And we got that from a new paper by economist Ed Wolff based on data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances. It comes out every three years. That was quite a mouthful. But the figures we used are updated through the end of 2015, and the comparison year we used was 1982. The same time period applies to the figures about the top 1 percent.

Here's the idea. The income of any company is split between the owners of the company and the workers. And the point of unions was to get a bigger share for the workers. But given the decline of unions and just the fact that companies are reluctant to increase their workers' pay, Branko says that we should figure out how to turn workers into owners themselves.MILANOVIC: We really need a much more widely spread ownership of capital.GARCIA: So more shares, more stocks, more bonds, things like that.MILANOVIC: Absolutely - because those things are currently extremely concentrated in the top 1 percent or the top 5 percent.GARCIA: Branko says there are different ways you could do this. You could push companies to expand employee stock-ownership programs. You could give big tax breaks specifically targeted at middle-class investors. That might help. And there's other ideas, creative ideas that maybe we just haven't come up with yet. Look, rising inequality is obviously a really hard problem to solve, but Branko makes a compelling case. In the 21st century, just focusing on how much workers are making in salaries and benefits from their employers won't be enough to save the middle class. If the people getting ahead are the owners of capital, we have to figure out a way to help middle-class people own more capital too. And then maybe they won't go another couple of decades lagging behind the rich.(SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC SONG, \"WAKING UP TO THE FIRE\")GARCIA: By the way, we promised you an endnote about those figures we cited at the top. I know a lot of the nerds are going to be curious about this. The average middle-class wage of $52,200 is actually the average of the third quintile of income owners. And we got that from a new paper by economist Ed Wolff based on data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances. It comes out every three years. That was quite a mouthful. But the figures we used are updated through the end of 2015, and the comparison year we used was 1982. The same time period applies to the figures about the top 1 percent.

We can't expect most people to go to school for 25 years.MILANOVIC: You're bounded from above. There is a ceiling.GARCIA: Instead of focusing on getting people to spend more years in school, Branko says we should focus on making the quality of education more equal for everyone. He argues for getting rid of some of the tax privileges that private schools enjoy and spending more on public schools. So that's education. The second idea you hear a lot about is raising taxes. Raise taxes on the rich and maybe the upper-middle class and use that money to help the middle class and the poor. Branko says there's a few reasons that's less likely to happen now.MILANOVIC: We are limited by two forces. The first one is globalization. You cannot really tax people as much as you did in the past because they are actually much more likely to move, whether themselves physically or their capital.GARCIA: In other words, he's saying that if you raise taxes, people will either move themselves or they'll move their money. They'll just leave the country or they'll place their money in another country that's a little bit more favorable. But also, Branko says, people just don't trust the government quite as much as they used to, and so they're less likely to support tax hikes because they don't think the government will spend the money well.So we've now looked at education and at taxes. The third and last idea you hear a lot about is to find ways for unions to be important again. Their membership has been falling for more than half a century. And yes, Branko says, government policies have played a role in the decline of unions, but the government isn't the only reason for it.MILANOVIC: I think the problem is deeper, is that essentially, you have a decline of unionization in all countries, particularly in private companies - is because the nature of job have changed. Historically, we were in large factories where you have lots of people with very single, very clear objective - is to increase wages, to negotiate for that. They are really a single-issue constituency. Well, now you have - because you have many more educated people, you have a dispersed labor force. You have many more people in services in small units.GARCIA: So we're no longer in the economy of the past, where thousands of similar workers would stand side by side on assembly lines. Now we're in this new economy where people are much more spread out. They're all doing different jobs in different places.

He argues for getting rid of some of the tax privileges that private schools enjoy and spending more on public schools. So that's education. The second idea you hear a lot about is raising taxes. Raise taxes on the rich and maybe the upper-middle class and use that money to help the middle class and the poor. Branko says there's a few reasons that's less likely to happen now.MILANOVIC: We are limited by two forces. The first one is globalization. You cannot really tax people as much as you did in the past because they are actually much more likely to move, whether themselves physically or their capital.GARCIA: In other words, he's saying that if you raise taxes, people will either move themselves or they'll move their money. They'll just leave the country or they'll place their money in another country that's a little bit more favorable. But also, Branko says, people just don't trust the government quite as much as they used to, and so they're less likely to support tax hikes because they don't think the government will spend the money well.So we've now looked at education and at taxes. The third and last idea you hear a lot about is to find ways for unions to be important again. Their membership has been falling for more than half a century. And yes, Branko says, government policies have played a role in the decline of unions, but the government isn't the only reason for it.MILANOVIC: I think the problem is deeper, is that essentially, you have a decline of unionization in all countries, particularly in private companies - is because the nature of job have changed. Historically, we were in large factories where you have lots of people with very single, very clear objective - is to increase wages, to negotiate for that. They are really a single-issue constituency. Well, now you have - because you have many more educated people, you have a dispersed labor force. You have many more people in services in small units.GARCIA: So we're no longer in the economy of the past, where thousands of similar workers would stand side by side on assembly lines. Now we're in this new economy where people are much more spread out. They're all doing different jobs in different places. And this new world is one where we're unlikely to see the same kind of strong union growth that we had, say, 50 years ago.But Branko has a solution to this, a way for workers to make more money even without unions. Here's the idea. The income of any company is split between the owners of the company and the workers. And the point of unions was to get a bigger share for the workers. But given the decline of unions and just the fact that companies are reluctant to increase their workers' pay, Branko says that we should figure out how to turn workers into owners themselves.MILANOVIC: We really need a much more widely spread ownership of capital.GARCIA: So more shares, more stocks, more bonds, things like that.MILANOVIC: Absolutely - because those things are currently extremely concentrated in the top 1 percent or the top 5 percent.GARCIA: Branko says there are different ways you could do this. You could push companies to expand employee stock-ownership programs. You could give big tax breaks specifically targeted at middle-class investors. That might help. And there's other ideas, creative ideas that maybe we just haven't come up with yet. Look, rising inequality is obviously a really hard problem to solve, but Branko makes a compelling case. In the 21st century, just focusing on how much workers are making in salaries and benefits from their employers won't be enough to save the middle class. If the people getting ahead are the owners of capital, we have to figure out a way to help middle-class people own more capital too. And then maybe they won't go another couple of decades lagging behind the rich.(SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC SONG, \"WAKING UP TO THE FIRE\")GARCIA: By the way, we promised you an endnote about those figures we cited at the top. I know a lot of the nerds are going to be curious about this. The average middle-class wage of $52,200 is actually the average of the third quintile of income owners.

I know a lot of the nerds are going to be curious about this. The average middle-class wage of $52,200 is actually the average of the third quintile of income owners. And we got that from a new paper by economist Ed Wolff based on data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances. It comes out every three years. That was quite a mouthful. But the figures we used are updated through the end of 2015, and the comparison year we used was 1982. The same time period applies to the figures about the top 1 percent.

Historically, we were in large factories where you have lots of people with very single, very clear objective - is to increase wages, to negotiate for that. They are really a single-issue constituency. Well, now you have - because you have many more educated people, you have a dispersed labor force. You have many more people in services in small units.GARCIA: So we're no longer in the economy of the past, where thousands of similar workers would stand side by side on assembly lines. Now we're in this new economy where people are much more spread out. They're all doing different jobs in different places. And this new world is one where we're unlikely to see the same kind of strong union growth that we had, say, 50 years ago.But Branko has a solution to this, a way for workers to make more money even without unions. Here's the idea. The income of any company is split between the owners of the company and the workers. And the point of unions was to get a bigger share for the workers. But given the decline of unions and just the fact that companies are reluctant to increase their workers' pay, Branko says that we should figure out how to turn workers into owners themselves.MILANOVIC: We really need a much more widely spread ownership of capital.GARCIA: So more shares, more stocks, more bonds, things like that.MILANOVIC: Absolutely - because those things are currently extremely concentrated in the top 1 percent or the top 5 percent.GARCIA: Branko says there are different ways you could do this. You could push companies to expand employee stock-ownership programs. You could give big tax breaks specifically targeted at middle-class investors. That might help. And there's other ideas, creative ideas that maybe we just haven't come up with yet. Look, rising inequality is obviously a really hard problem to solve, but Branko makes a compelling case. In the 21st century, just focusing on how much workers are making in salaries and benefits from their employers won't be enough to save the middle class.

        "title": "Is wealth inequality leading to a class war?",
        "domain": "vox.com",
        "text": "“Wealth” is someone’s net worth — that is, their assets (like savings, stock portfolios, and the value of their property) minus their debts (like student loans). “Wealth inequality” is measured by looking at how total wealth is spread out across the population. The more wealth there is at the top, the more inequality there is because there’s less to go around for everyone else.\nToday, there’s a huge gap in incomes between rich and poor. Even though incomes across the board rose at relatively similar rates in the decades after World War Two, incomes at the very top started to grow much faster after the 1970s — a trend that’s driven, at least in part, by shrinking union membership. For instance, CEOs’ compensation has grown by 1,085 percent since 1978 while the average worker’s salary has only grown by 24 percent.\nAnd though wages at the bottom have grown at a faster clip than those at the top in recent years, that change has not been enough to reverse the overall trend. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of earners saw their wages grow by 182 percent; the bottom 90 percent saw their wages grow by 44 percent. As a result, the concentration of money at the top of the income ladder is at the highest it’s been in nearly 100 years.\nBut that’s income inequality, which just looks at the distribution of people’s wages. What’s more extreme is the gap in wealth between rich and poor households. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the bottom half of households have an average net worth of $51,000. Collectively, they own just 2.5 percent of household wealth in the country. By contrast, the top 10 percent of households had an average net worth of nearly $7 million and own more than two-thirds of household wealth — a share that has only been growing over the last three decades.\nThere are other worrying aspects of the wealth gap, including racial inequality. On average, for every $1 that white families owned, Black families and Latino families owned 23 cents and 19 cents, respectively.\nClass warfare, or class conflict, happens when the tension between social classes comes to a boil. That happens when the interests of different classes diverge, building resentment between them. Oftentimes, this comes in the form of protest or revolt and is generally viewed as a struggle between workers and the ruling class or elites in society. Sometimes this gets violent, as was the case in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, when workers in multiple states went on strike after railroad workers saw their wages get repeatedly cut. Eventually the rebellion was squashed by the National Guard and private militias, and about 100 people were killed.\nWhy does this matter?\nPart of the reason you might be hearing phrases like “wealth inequality” or “class warfare” more often these days is because the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few has been on full display. In January, for example, Donald Trump, a billionaire, was sworn in as president while being surrounded by other billionaires. (There were many, many millionaires in the audience as well.) So as most Americans who watched Trump’s inaugural address saw it on their screens, a handful of the world’s richest men had a front-row seat. In fact, the combined wealth of everyone at the Capitol that day topped $1.2 trillion.\nAt its very core, the reason this level of inequality is bad is because it’s deeply unfair. But it’s not just a matter of fairness. It’s also dangerous. The fact that so few people own so much wealth is a threat to democracy.\nIn his farewell address, former President Joe Biden warned the nation that the United States was becoming an oligarchy — a system of government in which power is only shared by a small group of elites. It’s a warning that politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have been talking about for years, especially after the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United allowed corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.\nThe hoarding of wealth is already having an impact on our government. Since Trump returned to the White House, he’s handed over a lot of power to Elon Musk, who, with a net worth of hundreds of billions of dollars, stands to be the world’s richest man. And while Musk is charged with gutting the federal workforce, he’s not required to adhere to certain government standards.\nWhy is it that Musk has been able to evade the ethics rules that typically apply to other government personnel? And why is it, anyway, that Musk — now an unelected bureaucrat — has so much influence over policymaking? The answer is that Musk likely gained access to so much power because he spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the election last year in an attempt to help Republicans win, and his investment seems to have paid off. He operates by different rules than everyone else because he can simply buy his way to the White House.\nThe concentration of wealth has also degraded some of the country’s institutions outside of government. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, who owns the Washington Post, directed the newspaper’s opinion pages to avoid publishing views that are in conflict with his own, focusing their coverage on “personal liberties and free markets.” Bezos also killed the Post’s endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall.\nIt’s not necessarily the case, though, that America is on the brink of a class war, despite the fact that there’s so much inequality that billionaires are taking joyrides to space while millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. In fact, the last election cycle showed that people in different income brackets are becoming less politically divided, with Trump making gains among poorer voters, who historically have overwhelmingly voted for Democrats.\nBut if history is any guide, this level of inequality is unsustainable, and the economy might course-correct. Between 1800 and 1920, for example, inequality in the US grew very quickly. But in the 60 years that followed, the gap between rich and poor shrank significantly. During that period, the wealth of the average family grew 40 times its size while the wealthiest Americans saw their fortunes double.\nIt’s hard to say how the situation will improve this time. But chances are, at some point, that the rich will push their luck and the rest will say enough.",

        "domain": "cnbc.com",
        "text": "The rise of income inequality and the struggles of so many families to get ahead have shaken American politics across the spectrum.\nPresident Donald Trump invokes the plight of “the forgotten people.” Liberals call for massive new government programs.\nWall Street titan Jamie Dimon proposes “a Marshall Plan for America.” Ideological conservatives warn of a socialist uprising that would ruin American capitalism.\nBut economists who study the issue say it need not come to that. With bold and targeted steps, they argue, government can increase opportunity and incomes for many more people in ways that strengthen, not weaken, American capitalism.\nHere are five of them:\nBolstering human capital\n“We could tax more from all the folks at the top to spend money making investments in the people who are being left behind,” says University of Maryland economist Melissa Kearney.\nThat includes access to affordable health care, job training, apprenticeships and vocational education. Most important is improved basic education, beginning with prekindergarten programs for 3- and 4-year-olds.\n“I don’t think education by itself is a solution to income inequality,” says MIT’s David Autor. “It’s the best tool in our toolkit.”\nRaising wages and returns\nGovernment can make employment more profitable for low-income workers. A higher minimum wage is just one way, and a limited one.\n“There’s only so much you could do in terms of making workers more expensive without actually harming the people you’re trying to help,” Kearney said.\nAlternatives include increasing the earned income tax credit and subsidizing child-care services so more low-income parents can work. Easing occupational licensing requirements would smooth the path to more people taking up higher-paying lines of work, and loosening prohibitions against work would boost incomes for millions of Americans now reliant on disability benefits.\nAltering corporate governance\nIn recent decades, the rise of “shareholder capitalism” in the American system has reduced the influence of workers in economic decision-making and enhanced the influence of business owners. Government and corporations can alter the social contract.\n“The idea that corporations should just maximize profits without any regard to any other objective is fairly recent,” Autor says. “It’s possible to imagine adjustments to the structure of corporate governance that would think a little harder about additional stakeholders and potential beneficiaries aside from just owners.”\nFor example, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has proposed that workers at a corporation be allowed to elect 40% of the board of directors. Similar arrangements in Germany have resulted in much more limited use of one manifestation of shareholder capitalism — stock buybacks.\nExpanding infrastructure\nBetter roads, bridges and airports can improve productivity and prosperity for business owners and workers alike. So can digital connections to sparsely populated communities the 21st century economy has left behind\n“Forty percent of rural Americans don’t have access to broadband internet,” Kearney says. “That’s like electricity to a previous generation, so that’s an obvious infrastructure investment that would make a place more conducive to job growth.”\nAt the same time, the cost of a decent home keeps many potential workers from opportunities in economically thriving cities. Relaxed zoning, development subsidies and rental assistance could increase the stock of affordable housing.\nProtecting intellectual property\nTrump’s tariffs have roiled financial markets. And a trade war with China won’t bring many manufacturing jobs back.\nBut improved protection of intellectual property can help the new American economy.\n“The Trump administration has been correct to focus on that area of dispute with China,” Autor says. “China has not played by the rules … and forced a lot of disgorgement of U.S. intellectual property, which ultimately will make us poorer over the long run.\n“It’s not at this point so much about jobs as it is about ownership of ideas and control of frontier sectors that we don’t want to lose like aircraft, like microprocessors, like personal computers and mobile phones, like pharmaceuticals.”\nNone of these steps is easy. Substantial economic change ignites conflict — in Washington, on Wall Street, on Main Street.\nBut they could shift entrenched patterns that have left tens of millions of Americans feeling economically helpless.\n“There are many countries that are facing the same set of challenges,” Autor says. “And they’ve adapted in different ways.\n“If we compare ourselves to Germany, to Canada, to Sweden, to Switzerland, Norway — these are all a spectrum of market economies. We all have mixed economies, ranging from sort of cowboy capitalism in the United States to kind of cuddly capitalism in Norway. And those countries have made different choices about how much they want to push against those forces through a variety of programs.”\nThe question is whether public policy is susceptible to big changes. The 2020 campaign will tell whether discontent has grown powerful enough to force them.\n“I worry that there’s a complacency from some folks that, you know, this is always been the American way,” Kearney says. “Our capitalist system continues to be the best in the world and it’s all going to work.\n“There are global forces,” she concludes. “Things are different now.”",

        "domain": "vox.com",
        "text": "The classic promise of the American dream is that no matter where you grew up, no matter how poor you were as a kid, you can still have a path to financial stability in the United States as long as you work hard. But the truth is that poverty in the US is much more persistent than it is in other high-income countries. In fact, a poor American kid is much less likely to escape poverty in adulthood than a poor kid in Denmark or Germany or the United Kingdom.\nObviously, that’s not because Americans aren’t willing to work hard. Many studies have shown just how big a role your early years — and things like the quality of the school you attended, the safety of your childhood neighborhood, and the social networks you had access to as a kid — play in your future economic outcomes. So the hope has been that by focusing social programs on reducing childhood poverty, we can reduce adult poverty in the long term.\nBut while directing government resources toward reducing child poverty is crucial, childhood poverty alone doesn’t explain why poverty is so much more likely to follow you through life in the US than it is in peer countries. A recent study underscores one major factor that makes poor American kids so likely to stay poor, and it’s strikingly simple: It’s not just that the US government doesn’t provide kids with enough support, but that adults are also in need of a much more generous social safety net.\nTo better understand the links between childhood and adult poverty and what can break that cycle, I spoke with the study’s lead author, Zachary Parolin, an associate professor at Bocconi University and a senior research fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy. Here is our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity.\nThe US prides itself on being a place where there’s a lot of upward mobility. But how does the US actually compare to peer countries when it comes to upward mobility?\nThere are a lot of studies that focus on intergenerational mobility broadly defined, maybe based on your earnings in adulthood compared to your parents’ earnings. We know from that literature that, in general, the influence of your parental background tends to matter more in the US than other high-income countries.\nOne slight difference in our approach of looking at this is saying, “What if we just care about the intergenerational persistence of poverty?” In other words, if you’re born into poverty in the US, what are your chances of escaping poverty in your own adulthood relative to, say, children who grew up in poverty in Denmark, Germany, Australia, or the United Kingdom? And what we find is that poverty in the US is much, much stickier than in other high-income countries, and by a substantial margin. So if you grow up poor in the US, your odds of being poor in adulthood are a magnitude of two to four times higher than some of the other high-income countries we looked at.\nSo the topline findings are that growing up poor in the United States is particularly consequential for your adult economic outcomes, undermining this idea that the US, relative to peer nations, is some land of great upward economic opportunity.\nWe often focus on how important factors in childhood are to someone’s prospects of escaping poverty later in life — things like zip codes, schools, social networks — but what you found is that there’s one thing missing from those conversations, and that’s government support during adulthood, not just childhood. How did you reach that conclusion?\nI want to start by saying I don’t want to undervalue the importance of income support provided during childhood. Reducing child property, direct income transfers, or other service-oriented provisions remains incredibly important.\nWhat we show is that if you want to explain why the US has a much higher persistence of poverty than other high-income countries, a really large part of that equation is that if you grow up or in the US and you’re in adulthood — and maybe you don’t have full-time work, maybe you didn’t get that college degree — the state is doing much less to support you.\nJust to try to contextualize this a little bit more, imagine two people — one in the US, one in Denmark. They both grow up spending maybe half their childhood in poverty. In both countries, they’re less likely to go get a university degree relative to other kids who didn’t grow up in poverty. They might be less likely to work in full-time employment. But that Dane who still suffers the consequences of having grown up in poverty, in their adulthood, they still might get some generous social assistance whereas the similar adult in the US just isn’t getting access to the same type of support.\nSo the lingering consequences of child poverty for one’s income in adulthood happen to be stronger in the US in part due to the reduced economic assistance provided by the state, and that’s what we find explains the large part of the variation.\nOne surprising thing your study found was that while Black kids are much more likely to grow up in poverty than white kids, racial discrimination doesn’t actually make poverty persist more. White kids are just as likely to be stuck in poverty well into adulthood. Can you explain why that is?\nYeah, we were actually surprised by this finding, and we try to be cautious in how we explain it. It’s certainly true that Black children in the US are much more likely to be poor than white individuals. We see that clearly in our data. But the link between that child poverty and adult poverty is roughly similar.\nIn our data, if you have a Black child and a white child who spend half their childhoods in poverty, the association of spending half your childhood in poverty and the likelihood that you’re poor in adulthood is pretty much the same for those two kids. But it is in fact true that Black children and adults are much more exposed to poverty overall.\nIt’s absolutely true that discrimination still exists and discrimination is a big part of why Black individuals are exposed to more poverty both in childhood and adulthood. But what we find empirically is that, given a certain amount of exposure to poverty, it’s bad for you regardless, and it’s not just racial discrimination that explains why the US is so much worse relative to other countries, even if that, of course, is a factor in many other dimensions of economic opportunity in the US.\nSo a lot of this seems pretty obvious: It’s very logical to say that if you provide people with more public support in adulthood, then they’re less likely to be poor. So why is it important for people, and especially policymakers, to pay attention to your study? What’s the lesson here that we didn’t already know?\nI think the big lesson is related to some of these intergenerational outcomes. In other words, understanding how the conditions you grow up in are going to influence the conditions you face in adulthood. Understanding how we think about that from the lens of fairness and equity concerns and then: What can we do about it?\nThe reduction of poverty through income transfers [like unemployment insurance benefits] in itself is a good thing, but what we show is that beyond reducing hardship, these transfers have the ability to reduce that link between childhood poverty and adult poverty. In other words, they have the ability to reduce that link between conditions that you didn’t choose, that you inherited as a result of your birth and your parents’ economic circumstances when you were young, and your ability to meet your basic needs in your own adulthood.\nBeyond the million other reasons to care about reducing poverty in the short run, here is another reason that some of those income transfers in adulthood are important, and in general, understanding why this link between childhood poverty and adult poverty is so much stickier in the US than in other countries.",

        "title": "The new class war: A wealth gap between millennials",
        "domain": "cnbc.com",
        "text": "The wealth gap between rich millennials and the rest of their age group is the largest of any generation, creating a new wave of class tension and resentment, according to a recent study.\nEven as the vast majority of millennials struggle with student debt, low-wage service-jobs, unaffordable housing and low savings, the millennial elite are surpassing previous generations. According to the study, the average millennial has 30% less wealth at the age of 35 than baby boomers did at the same age. Yet the top 10% of millennials have 20% more wealth than the top baby boomers at the same age.\n“Millennials are so different from one another that it is not particularly meaningful to talk about the ‘average’ Millennial experience,” wrote the study’s authors, Rob Gruijters, Zachary Van Winkle and Anette Eva Fasang. “There are some Millennials who are doing extremely well—think Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman—while others are struggling.”\nThe study finds that millennials — typically defined as those between the age of 28 and 43 today — have faced repeated financial headwinds. Coming of age during the financial crisis, they have lower levels of homeownership, larger debts outweighing assets, low-wage and unstable jobs, and lower rates of dual-income family formation.\nAt the same time, the authors say the top 10% of millennials have benefited from greater rewards for skilled jobs. As they put it, “The returns to high-status work trajectories have increased, while the returns to low-status trajectories have stagnated or declined.”\nThe millennials who “went to college, found graduate level jobs, and started families relatively late,” ended up with “higher levels of wealth than Baby Boomers with similar life trajectories,” according to the report.\nThe great wealth transfer\nThere may be another factor creating so much wealth among millennials: inheritances. In what’s known as “the great wealth transfer,” baby boomers are expected to pass down between $70 trillion and $90 trillion in wealth over the next 20 years. Much of that is expected to go to their millennial children. High-net-worth individuals worth $5 million or more will account for nearly half of that total, according to Cerulli Associates.\nWealth management firms say some of that wealth has already starting trickling down to the next generation.\n“The great wealth transfer, which we’ve all been talking about for the last 10 years, is underway,” said John Mathews, head of UBS’ Private Wealth Management division. “The average age of the world’s billionaires is almost 69 right now. So this whole transition or wealth handover will start to accelerate.”\nTensions between millennial classes are likely to escalate as more wealth is transferred in the coming years. Wealth displays on social media by millennial “nepo babies” could add to the intra-generational class war and drive nonwealthy millennials to overspend or create the appearance of lavish lifestyles to keep up.\nA survey by Wells Fargo found that 29% of affluent millennials (defined as having assets of $250,000 to over $1 million of investible assets) admit they “sometimes buy items they cannot afford to impress others.” According to the survey, 41% of affluent millennials admit to funding their lifestyles with credit cards or loans, versus 28% of Gen Xers and 6% of baby boomers.\nThe battle between rich millennials and the rest could also shape their attitudes toward wealth. For over four decades, the vast majority of millionaires and billionaires created in America have been self-made, mostly entrepreneurs. A study by Fidelity Investments found that 88% of American millionaires are self-made.\nYet inherited wealth could become more common. A study by UBS found that among newly minted billionaires last year, heirs who inherited their fortunes racked up more wealth than self-made billionaires for the first time in at least nine years. And, all the billionaires under the age of 30 on the latest Forbes billionaires list inherited their wealth, for the first time in 15 years.\n‘Extreme’ wealth\nThe surge in wealth among millennial heirs is also creating a lucrative new market for wealth-management firms, luxury companies, travel firms and real estate brokers.\nClayton Orrigo, one of the top luxury real estate brokers in Manhattan, has built a thriving business on moneyed millennials. The founder of the Hudson Advisory Team at Compass has sold over $4 billion in real estate and regularly brokers deals over $10 million. He says the “vast majority” of his business lately is from buyers in their 20s and 30s with inherited wealth.\n“I just sold a $16 million apartment to someone in their mid-20s, and the buyer accessed the family trust,” he said. “The wealth that is behind these kids is extreme.”\nInherited wealth has become Orrigo’s specialty. He says he works on forging close relationships with family offices, trusts and young money elite mingling at New York membership clubs like Casa Cipriani.\nThe pattern is familiar: A wealthy family calls wanting a rental for their son or daughter; a few years later, they want a $5 million or $10 million two-bedroom condo to buy in a new, high-security building downtown.\n“My gig is working very quietly and very discreetly with the wealthiest families in the world,” Orrigo said.",

        "text": "Over the last 50 years, the poverty rate in the U.S. has barely budged: Around 11% of the U.S. population was considered poor in 2019. In 1970, just about 12% was.\n“There is no real improvement here, just a long stasis,” sociologist Matthew Desmond writes in his new book, “Poverty, by America.” His last book, “Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City,” won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction.\nIn his latest book, Desmond explores the reason for that stagnation and suggests that many Americans and corporations profit from tens of millions of people having so little. Banks make billions a year in overdraft fees. Companies are able to pay their workers low wages and save on benefits.\nHis book is filled with statistics that bring the inequitable state of the U.S. economy into sharp focus. Here are five of them.\n1. Wages rose slowly for the poorest Americans\nSince 1979, the bottom 90% of income earners in the U.S. experienced annual earnings gains of only 24%, Desmond writes, while the wages of the top 1% of earners more than doubled. His findings are based on data from a number of sources, including the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Pew Research Center.\nLooking at inflation-adjusted earnings, ordinary workers have seen their pay tick up just 0.3% a year for several decades, Desmond writes. “Astonishingly, the real wages for many Americans today are roughly what they were 40 years ago.”\n2. More government aid for the financially comfortable\nIn 2020, the federal government spent $53 billion on direct housing assistance for the needy. That same year, it shelled out over $193 billion on homeowner subsidies such as the home mortgage interest deduction. Desmond analyzed tax data from a number of sources, including the Office of Management and Budget.\n“Most families who enjoy those subsidies have six-figure incomes and are white,” Desmond writes. “Poor families lucky enough to live in government-owned apartments often have to deal with mold and even lead paint, while rich families are claiming the mortgage interest deduction on first and second homes.”\n3. 1 in 18 live in ‘deep poverty’\nIn his book, Desmond, analyzing data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources, reports that 1 in 18 people in the U.S. live in what’s considered “deep poverty,” or what he calls “a subterranean level of scarcity.”\nIn 2020, this category included people who make less than $6,380 a year, or families of four living on less than $13,100. In 2020, almost 18 million people in America lived in these conditions, including some 5 million children.\n“There is growing evidence that America harbors a hard bottom layer of deprivation, a kind of extreme poverty once thought to exist only in faraway places of bare feet and swollen bellies,” Desmond writes.\n4. Racial wealth gap is as large as in the ’60s\nLooking at the work of other authors and Federal Reserve data, Desmond found that the racial wealth gap is as wide today as it was more than five decades ago.\nIn 2019, the median white household had a net worth of $188,200, compared with $24,100 for the median Black household.\n“Our legacy of systematically denying Black people access to the nation’s land and riches has been passed from generation to generation,” he wrote.\nMost first-time homebuyers, he explains, get down-payment help from their parents. And many of those parents are able to assist their children by refinancing their own homes, “as their parents did for them after the government subsidized homeownership in white communities in the wake of World War II.”\n5. Overdraft fees mostly paid by the poor\nIn 2019, the largest U.S. banks charged Americans $11.68 billion in overdraft fees, Desmond found, looking at a number of reports, including from the Center for Responsible Lending.\nJust 9% of those account holders paid the lion’s share, 84%, of those charges — customers who carried an average balance of less than $350.\n“The poor were made to pay for their poverty,” Desmond wrote.",

This has increased since 2013, showing that income inequality has risen in nearly every state.\nThe paper looked at the income of families across the nation and assessed inequality at the state, metropolitan area and county level using data from the IRS. The incomes are averages of the IRS summaries of taxpayers in each income range.\nMind the gap\nTo be in the top 1 percent of earners in the United States in 2015, a family would have to have brought in $421,926 in pre-tax dollars. What qualifies as the top 1 percent varies by each state, and the states with the highest thresholds are California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York.\nNationwide, the average income of the bottom 99 percent is $50,107 per family. This also varies depending on geography.\nBy looking at income data on the state and county level, it’s possible to get a more local picture of the trend of inequality.\nWhen inequality came up, “often the conversation would turn to, well, that’s New York City, it’s not my state,” said Mark Price, a labor economist at the Keystone Research Center and co-author of the EPI paper.\n“Rising inequality affects virtually every part of the country, not just large urban areas or financial centers,” said Estelle Sommeiller, a socio-economist at the Institute for Research in Economics and Social Sciences in France and co-author of the paper. “It’s a persistent problem throughout the country — in big cities and small towns, in all 50 states.”\nBetween the years 2009 to 2015, the incomes of those in the top 1 percent grew faster than the incomes of the bottom 99 percent in 43 states and the District of Columbia. In nine states, the income growth of the top 1 percent was half or more of all income growth in that time period.\nA recent trend\nThis trend is a reversal of what happened in the United States in the years during and after the Great Depression. From 1928 until 1973, the share of income held by the top 1 percent declined in nearly every state.\nThe report from the EPI attributes that growth to a different atmosphere for workers, where the minimum wage generally was steadily rising and they were able to join unions and bargain for rights.\nToday, while unemployment remains low and the economy is doing exceptionally well, wage growth has remained stagnant.\n“When you look at economic expansions, it’s in that recovery that you see income growth – businesses recover, reorganize, workers find jobs,” Price said.\nIn those expansions since 1973, there has been less income growth for the bottom 99 percent, said Price.\nMeanwhile, CEO pay has increased from about 20 times the typical worker’s pay to 271 times greater, from 1965 to 2016, according to 2017 a study by the EPI.\nAs the economic recovery continues, Price said that it is critically important to continue to look at growth and specifically how it is distributed.\n“For some reason, the economy just doesn’t have the generation of wage growth we’d like to see,” Price said. “We like to focus a light on the way that income is distributed to share that the people who make decisions are benefiting from the economy in a way we might not all be.”",

        "domain": "economist.com",
        "text": "ccording to a familiar saying, academic disputes are so vicious precisely because the stakes are so low. But in a scholarly battle over inequality, the stakes are rather higher. Research by a trio of French economists—Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman—has popularised the notion that American income inequality is soaring. Other economists have built heaps of research upon these findings, while politicians have pledged to undo the trends through higher taxes and spending. To most people the phrase “inequality is rising” seems self-evidently true.\nOthers have cast doubt on the trio’s findings, however—notably Gerald Auten of the Treasury Department and David Splinter of the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan group in Congress. We first analysed their work in 2019, as part of a cover story. It modifies the French trio’s methodology and comes to a very different conclusion: American post-tax income inequality has hardly risen at all since the 1960s. In the past few days the Journal of Political Economy (JPE), one of the discipline’s most prestigious outlets, has accepted their paper for publication.\nThis has not settled the debate. In fact, the opposing sides are digging in. “I don’t think that inequality denial (after climate denial) is a very promising road to follow,” Mr Piketty tells your columnist. “We’ve been showered with prizes from the establishment for our academic contributions on this very topic,” adds Mr Saez. Others say the JPE paper has won the day. “It seems clearly correct to me,” says Tyler Cowen of George Mason University. “The Piketty and Saez work is careless and politically motivated,” says James Heckman, a Nobel prizewinner at the University of Chicago.\nYou might think that analysing trends in income inequality would be straightforward. Don’t people’s tax returns tell researchers all they need to know? But although tax returns are useful, they can mislead. Americans who are partners in a company, or hold investments, often have enough trouble estimating their own income. Now imagine trying to estimate the incomes of millions of people over several decades, accounting for overhauls to the tax code. Researchers then need to account for the 30-40% of national income that is not even reported on tax returns—including some employer-provided benefits and government welfare. Researchers’ methodological choices have huge effects on the results.\nMessrs Auten and Splinter focus much of their attention on the distorting impact of an important tax reform in 1986. Before it was introduced many rich people used tax shelters that allowed them to report less income on their tax return and therefore pay less to the irs. In “Mad Men”, a television series about advertising executives in the 1960s, Don Draper and his pals fund their lavish lifestyles by putting lots of spending on expenses. Reforms made such wheezes harder, and increased incentives to report income, in part by lowering rates. Looking only at his tax return, Draper might appear to have got richer after 1986, even as his true income stayed the same. Once this is corrected for, the rise in top incomes is less dramatic than it might at first appear. In some papers one-third of the long-term rise in inequality occurs around 1986.\nMessrs Auten and Splinter make other adjustments. Messrs Piketty and Saez have focused on “tax units”, typically households who file taxes in a single return. This introduces bias. In recent decades marriage has declined among poorer Americans. As a consequence, the share of income enjoyed by those at the top appears to have risen, as the incomes of poorer people are spread across more households, even as those of richer households remain pooled. Messrs Auten and Splinter therefore rank individuals.\nThey also account for benefits provided by employers, including health insurance, which reduces the share of the top 1% in 2019 by about a percentage point. They make different assumptions about the allocation of government spending, and about misreported income. All in all, they find that after tax, the top 1% command about 9% of national income, compared with the 15% or so reported by Messrs Piketty, Saez and Zucman. Whereas the trio conclude that the share of the top 1% has sharply increased since the 1960s, Messrs Auten and Splinter find practically no change.\nTheir paper is a valuable contribution. Greg Kaplan of the University of Chicago, who edited it, notes that it was reviewed by four expert referees and went through two rounds of revisions that he oversaw. The paper is scholarly in the extreme (including delights such as “the deduction for loss carryovers is limited to 80% of taxable income computed without regard to the loss carryover”). The authors are clearly obsessive about the history of the tax code.\nYet their methodology has its own difficulties. “The remarkable thing is that almost all of their modifications push in the same direction—that’s something you wouldn’t expect a priori,” says Wojciech Kopczuk of Columbia University. Mr Splinter, speaking at a seminar in 2021, seemed not to have thought deeply about the potentially distorting effects of the decline of America’s informal economy. The gradual shift from cash-in-hand payments to direct deposits could have forced poorer folk such as cleaners and taxi-drivers to report more income on tax returns, making them appear richer when in fact they were not.\nI feel bad for you / I don’t think about you at all\nThe trio has concerns as well. Mr Piketty argues that “in order to get their results, Auten-Splinter implicitly assume that non-taxed labour income, pension income and capital income has been much more equally distributed than taxed income since 1980”, which he believes is unrealistic. Mr Saez seems a little fed up with the scholarly battle. “Our experience is that they haven’t changed anything of substance following these long exchanges.” But the JPE paper makes Mr Kopczuk “think that together with earlier papers we are now getting (wide) bounds for where the truth might be”. As a consequence, the idea that inequality is rising is very far from a self-evident truth.",

In the decade and a half since, fashion became bigger and bolder, she added.\nNow, the stealth-wealth style has been reborn once again as Americans’ economic circumstances get increasingly divided after the so-called K-shaped recovery left the wealthiest Americans even better off than before.\nThis time, however, there’s an even more understated undertone, notwithstanding the heftier price tag.\nOne of the central characters on “Succession” even scoffs at a tartan Burberry tote bag that retails for $2,890, calling the luxury bag “ludicrously capacious.”\nHow to get the stealth-wealth look for less\nCan the typical American afford a $600 Loro Piana cashmere baseball hat, like the one worn on “Succession”? “I really doubt it,” Serdari said.\nFortunately, the quiet luxury trend is less about buying the exact item, but rather replicating the look with clothes that fit well, in neutral tones or monochrome, she said.\nCarolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner and founder of Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida, suggests purchasing a few signature staples, such as a coat or handbag, on sale or from a local consignment store, and pairing them with less-expensive jeans and T-shirts from Target or Walmart — just as Roman Roy did in the final season of “Succession.”\nThis type of quiet luxury, without the name brands and logos, is “overdue,” added McClanahan, who also is a member of CNBC’s Advisor Council.\nAs the economy slows and persistent inflation makes many Americans feel stretched too thin, it’s time to shift away from a “keeping up with the Joneses” mentality.\n“Find quality things that last a lot longer — that’s better than throwaway pieces,” McClanahan said.",

        "domain": "cnbc.com",
        "text": "In June 2010, Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates and Warren Buffett started what could be described as the world’s most ambitious fundraising drive. After promising to give away the vast majority of their wealth, the trio asked their ultra-wealthy peers to pledge at least half of their assets to charity during their lifetimes or in their estates.\nIn two months, the Giving Pledge garnered signatures from 40 of America’s richest families and individuals to sign up. That first batch of pledgers, including Michael Bloomberg and David Rockefeller, was announced 15 years ago this week.\nIn the years since, the Giving Pledge has lost steam when it comes to enrollment. By the end of 2010, 57 signatories representing an estimated 14% of America’s billionaires had made the nonbinding commitment, according to a recent report by the Institute for Policy Studies. Currently, the pledge has commitments from 256 individuals, couples and families, including 110 American billionaires, per the progressive think tank. This group makes up 12% of the U.S. billionaire population as estimated by Forbes.\nThe annual number of sign-ups has also flagged since that first year. Even in 2020 when the pandemic spurred wealthy donors to give more, the Giving Pledge only earned 12 new signatories. This past May, the pledge welcomed 11 new members, a marked improvement over 2024′s record low of four.\nMeanwhile, over the past 10 years, the number of billionaires worldwide has increased by more than half to 2,891, according to UBS. Their wealth also doubled by more than half to an estimated $15.7 trillion, UBS said.\n“It’s disappointing in that you would hope more people would step up,” said Chuck Collins, program director at the IPS and great-grandson of the meatpacker Oscar Mayer.\nCollins, a co-author of the report, said the rapid increase in wealth may be partly to blame. This surge in wealth has also made it challenging for the pledgers to give away their money fast enough.\n“Some of this is fairly sudden, the wealth growth,” he said, “so you got to give people ... a decade of slack, if you just land in the billionaire class to figure it out.”\nWhether the Giving Pledge has been successful depends on whom you ask. The IPS report described the Giving Pledge as “unfulfilled, unfulfillable, and not our ticket to a fairer, better future” and identified only one living couple to have fulfilled the pledge, John and Laura Arnold.\nA spokesperson for the Giving Pledge described the IPS report as “misleading,” and said the IPS used incomplete data and excluded “significant forms of charitable giving,” including gifts to foundations.\n“For fifteen years, the Giving Pledge has helped create new norms of generosity and grown into a connected and active global learning community,” a spokesperson wrote in a statement to Inside Wealth.\nCollins said the Giving Pledge has some merit, describing it as a “community of peers among a group who don’t have a lot of peers.”\nAmir Pasic, dean of the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, said it has had a lasting impact on how the wealthy think about their giving.\n“I still think that it was really important attempt to socialize the new wealth that was emerging early on in this century,” he said. “We can interestingly debate how successful it has or hasn’t been, but it’s become a feature of the high-net-worth philanthropic landscape.”\nThough Giving Pledge enrollment has stagnated, other efforts to accelerate giving have emerged, said Pasic, citing the collective Blue Meridian Partners.\nAnd while some billionaires, particularly younger ones, may be reluctant to associate themselves with the Gateses and Buffett, it doesn’t mean they aren’t contributing in their own way, Pasic said.\n“Buffett is the senior representative of new wealth at the beginning of this century. New representatives have emerged since then,” he said.\nAccording to Collins, impact investing and other alternatives to traditional philanthropy have gained traction, especially among the new class of tech billionaires. He gave the example of Oracle’s Larry Ellison amending his pledge to focus his resources on technology research instead of traditional nonprofit organizations.\n“I think there’s a little more blurring between for profit and nonprofit, charity versus impact investing,” Collins said.\nVenture capital billionaire Marc Andreessen has gone so far as to declare that innovating technology — and amassing personal riches in the process — is philanthropic in and of itself.\n“Who gets more value from a new technology, the single company that makes it, or the millions or billions of people who use it to improve their lives? QED,” he wrote in 2023.\nPasic said it is possible that Bill Gates’ recent commitment to give away virtually all of his wealth over the next 20 years may bring new urgency to the Giving Pledge.\n“I think that remains to be seen,” he said, “whether it’s going to end up being more of a kind of a private club that becomes less relevant or if it’ll be the beginning of something broader, gaining new energy in this turbulent time and or spawning other kinds of groups ... or other collectives.”",

        "domain": "vox.com",
        "text": "I’ve been following debates on guaranteed income for almost a decade, and one thing that’s stood out is that universal basic income (UBI), a regular cash payment to all citizens with no strings attached, is like a Rorschach test.\nSome people see UBI as a “capitalist road to communism” or a world free of work. Others see everything from a means of unleashing the population’s creative potential to a policy that would undermine human agency and erode “psychological capital.” Some see it as a way to shore up the welfare state. Others, a way to bulldoze it.\nIn part, that’s because unless you pin down the details, basic income is too vague to mean anything politically concrete. Like the Rorschach inkblot, you can interpret and design UBI in an endless variety of ways. A program that provides $250 per month is a different ballgame than one providing $1,200 per month. The same goes for one that replaces all other welfare, like food aid (sometimes referred to as a “pure UBI,” which would actually leave the most disadvantaged worse off, and is a bad idea), compared with one that complements existing programs.\nUltimately, the effects of any income guarantee hinge on the details. How much does it pay? Who gets it? How’s it financed? How does it relate to the rest of the welfare state? But most of the real proposals that have made their way through the policy world share a noteworthy trait: When the dust settles, they just wouldn’t be that radical, in either direction.\nGenerally, most people at the bottom of the income ladder would be better off, those in the middle would break even as they pay about as much in higher taxes as they’d receive from the basic income, and those at the top would be a little worse off. Society would neither ascend into utopian communism nor collapse into bleak idleness. There would just be less poverty and higher taxes.\nI see this as good news. If basic income won’t be the silver bullet that changes — or destroys — society, it becomes something far more politically tractable: a moderately effective policy, albeit one with trade-offs, that is well worth considering.\nThe many faces of basic income\nAmong actual basic income proposals, some definitely have more of a radical edge than others. But not in terms of their economic effects. What’s radical about imagining a $1,000 per month UBI isn’t so much how it’d affect the economy — again, some would be better off, others would break even, others would be worse off. It’s how to get a program with a $3 trillion price tag through a Congress that couldn’t even solidify an incredibly successful basic income for children — the temporarily expanded child tax credit — that only cost about $100 billion.\nEven if the $3 trillion version were to pass, perhaps by effectively communicating how taxing some of the benefits back would lower the program’s net cost, the result would land US federal spending as a percentage of GDP right around where France and Scandinavian countries already sit. Which is to say, from the perspective of other social democracies, that level of spending would be normal.\nOne way to blunt the more radical politics of UBI is to style the income guarantee as a negative income tax (NIT) instead. The main difference is that NIT’s are means-tested, phasing out their benefit levels as earned income rises. Doing so could lower the sticker price while achieving basically the same economic effects as a UBI considered together with higher taxes, which claw back the benefits to achieve a similar effect as the NIT means-test phasing them out.\nFor example, one 2021 proposal outlined an NIT-style basic income that guaranteed $12,500 to all adults (plus an additional $4,500 per child). The benefit would begin phasing out when household income (calculated for two-adult households) reaches $15,000, and would zero out at a household income of $70,000. It was estimated to cost $876 billion per year. Compare that to the $3-or-so trillion of high-end UBI proposals that guarantee a similar amount.\nSince NIT can be made equivalent in distribution to UBI, but the politics lean in favor of the former, there’s an argument to be made that NIT is the realistic path forward. “A leading task for the left is to legitimize the notion of a new NIT,” writes the economist Max Sawicky in an excellent overview piece. “There are genuine ways to attenuate the power of Capital … The naïve version of UBI isn’t one of them.”\nThere are, of course, other trade-offs to consider. NIT imposes a hefty administrative burden, where monthly payments would have to be tuned to fluctuating incomes. There may also be a psychological difference between phasing out benefits and paying higher taxes.\nBut if you put that whole debate aside and keep poking at the economic effects of UBI, its radical mystique continues to dissipate.\nThe general pattern of basic income’s economic impact\nAs my colleague Dylan Matthews wrote, “whether or not basic income is a good idea depends entirely on how you pay for it.” In addition, when you look at UBI together with however you propose to pay for it, you begin to see through the radical veil.\nConsider one of the most common pairings: paying for UBI with a value-added tax (VAT — sorry, another acronym), a type of consumption tax used across 170 countries worldwide, including all of Europe, leveled on all purchases, including goods and services.\nThe economist William Gale ran the numbers on coupling a 10 percent VAT with a UBI payout that would range from $2,500 for individuals to about $5,200 for a family of four. The results look like this:\nThe poorest 20 percent of Americans would see their after-tax income rise about 17 percent — a significant anti-poverty gain. The next 20 percent of Americans would see only a modest gain, roughly 5 percent. The middle 20 percent would experience basically no change. The gains from their UBI would almost perfectly cancel out the higher tax rates they’d pay. And the remaining upper classes would see modest decreases in income, with the tax costs outstripping their UBI benefits.\nWhile the numbers will vary based on the details of the proposal, the trend is general: broad-based taxation coupled with a universal payout, the basic formula of most realistic UBI proposals, tends to leave those at the bottom better off, those in the middle about even, and those at the top a little worse off. It’s not incredibly radical — it’s just an effective anti-poverty policy.\nTurning to the macroeconometric models that economists use to predict how various policy changes might affect the economy, you’ll find a similar story. Whether predicting the effects of a tax-funded UBI with the progressive-leaning Levy Institute model or the more centered Penn Wharton Budget Model, GDP and employment rates neither balloon nor crater. Neither model foretells an upheaval in the economic order of things, just a few percentage points in one direction or the other.\nWe also have suggestive empirical evidence from 2021, the year we had that UBI for kids. The results were as follows: struggling families found it easier to feed their children, pay their utility bills, invest in education, and pay the rent. Employment rates hardly budged, moving us no closer — or farther away, depending on your tastes — to a world without work. (Though, to be fair, a program everyone knows is temporary likely has less impact on employment than if it were permanent.)\nRadical ideas have their place. They can stretch our collective imagination, and keep us from falling victim to the belief that there are no fundamental alternatives to the present arrangement of our world. But basic income doesn’t have to be one of them, and shedding that association offers at least two payoffs.\nIt could bring basic income further into the realm of pragmatic policy analysis, where wonks of all stripes present their views on whether or not the programs’ tradeoffs are worth it. Second, for those who want to elevate their sights on radical possibilities that might exceed political realities, why not dream bigger?",

        "text": "We’re flooded by guaranteed income pilot experiments that offer some promising results, but don’t seem to be moving us any closer to actual federal policy. Yet findings published today from the largest randomized basic income experiment in the US to date, backed by Sam Altman and OpenAI, should get your notice.\nThe study, held from November 2020 through October 2023, gave 1,000 recipients $1,000 per month, no strings attached. It’s one of the biggest and longest trials ever run on direct cash giving. Many other basic income pilots have given people $500 or less, and rarely for more than a year or two.\nWhile the study was run by a group of academics, it was set in motion by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. For years, Altman has been publicly worrying that basic income will become necessary as AI eliminates traditional jobs while creating huge stockpiles of wealth held by a few. “If public policy doesn’t adapt accordingly, most people will end up worse off than they are today,” he wrote in 2021. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.)\nAltman isn’t alone. Many major figures in the tech world, from Elon Musk to the “godfather of AI,” Geoffrey Hinton, believe AI will usher a wave of technological unemployment, and basic income will become necessary to keep us all afloat.\nOn this, I’m conflicted. In general, unconditional cash can be an effective anti-poverty policy, but the extensive list of small experiments and accumulating evidence doesn’t seem to be furthering the case of basic income to becoming a reality. So maybe any press is good press, and all the attention AI leaders are bringing to basic income will help it along. Spreading the fear of AI stealing all our jobs seems to garner much more enthusiasm for basic income than continually pointing at the evidence. (Just look at Andrew Yang’s 2020 presidential campaign, which centered on universal basic income as a response to automation.)\nBut hitching the case for basic income to fears of rapid AI progress makes it far more vulnerable than it needs to be. If there’s no great wave of AI-driven unemployment, if the AI bubble bursts and turns out to be hardly any different than cycles of innovation and technological unemployment in the past, support for basic income would fall, too.\net the arguments for some kind of basic income are strong, no matter what happens with AI. There could be absolutely no further progress, AI could come to a complete and eternal standstill, and the case for basic income would remain as strong as ever: unconditional cash can be a simple and flexible way to style income-support policies that actually reach everyone in need (at the trade-off of higher taxes).\nThe basic income movement might be better off severing ties with speculations about AI altogether. Then, the conversation could focus on what basic income can actually be: an effective anti-poverty tool that would neither stave off dystopia nor usher in a leisurely paradise, but instead, just a world with less poverty.\nNews from the largest randomized study of basic income in the US to date\nMany cash transfer advocates feel that the movement is overdue to graduate from research to actual policy. But the “Unconditional Income Study,” as this three-year endeavor by the nonprofit OpenResearch has been dubbed, added some welcome substance to the otherwise slim pile of research on big cash transfers over long periods of time. (OpenResearch is not affiliated directly with OpenAI, but it grew out of the tech accelerator Y Combinator when Altman ran it, and has received a combined $24 million from Altman and OpenAI’s nonprofit organization.)\nThe study gave out monthly checks to people between the ages of 21 and 40 living in Texas and Illinois. To qualify, their 2019 household income had to be less than 300 percent of the federal poverty line: that would mean $77,250 for a family of four, or $37,470 for an individual. The average participant’s household income in 2019 was about $30,000. One thousand people were randomized into the treatment group and received the full $1,000 per month, while another 2,000 were part of a control group that got $50 per month.\nThe results are coming out in batches, with two papers out today — one on employment effects and another on health outcomes — and another on consumption still in the works. So far, the results are kind of scrambled, refusing to neatly fit into any particular view on basic income.\nRecipients spent an average of $310 more per month, mostly on housing, food, and car expenses. Overall, however, their incomes fell by about $125 per month, excluding the transfers. The drop in earnings was largely driven by people choosing to work a little less (since the transfers meant they still came out ahead). In total, labor market participation declined by 2 percent, cashing out as working about 1.3 hours less per week, or roughly eight fewer days of work over the course of a year.\nAt first glance, this finding is somewhat at odds with other basic income experiments in the US, and challenges the narrative advocates have been pushing that unconditional cash won’t make people choose less work. Sometimes, maybe it will. But eight fewer days of work per year doesn’t exactly look like the doomsday scenario of everyone choosing to live out their remaining days on welfare, surfing, or playing video games on the taxpayer’s dime.\nThe cash’s impact on health was a little more straightforward: it didn’t seem to do much. Despite detailed data, including blood samples from some participants and nutritional intake, “We find essentially no evidence of improvements in physical health due to the transfers,” the paper states, “and can rule out even small improvements.”\nThere were short-lived improvements in mental health, mostly through reductions in stress. But they faded by the end of the first year. Recipients also showed a major increase in food security during year one, which also faded by the second year. If there was any silver lining in the paper on health, it was that recipients went to hospitals, doctors, and dentists more often, and spent about $20 more per month on medical care as a result of the transfer, which the authors note could translate into indirect benefits in the long term.\n“The appeal of cash transfers lies in the freedom that they give beneficiaries to make their own choices about what type of consumption to prioritize,” the authors conclude. “However, the nature of that freedom means that cash transfers are a blunt instrument for improving health and reducing health disparities specifically.”\nThe results suggest that policymakers interested in improving particular health outcomes might be better off pursuing more targeted interventions, like expanding Medicaid eligibility, reducing prescription drug costs, or making it easier to make primary care appointments. Targeting health directly, in other words, rather than simple cash.\nAs the researchers argue, “if policymakers seek to reduce poverty and improve the well-being of low-income groups more generally, cash transfers could still represent an important option, even if they do not improve health outcomes in the near term.”\nBasic income restored a little bit of capitalism’s forgotten promise: the freedom to choose more leisure time\nOne of the most controversial and politically charged parts of the basic income debate is how it would affect work. Among critical economists and policy wonks, the concern isn’t that we’ll need basic income because there won’t be any jobs left after AI, but that basic income could itself be the thing that wipes away our desire to work.\nWhether these results support that fear depends on how deeply you read into the details. The results clearly show that people do work a little less. But going a bit deeper, the employment effects were concentrated among young, single parents. Does the option for single parents to choose an extra eight days off per year constitute a policy failure — or success?\nThe project also captured pretty detailed time-use data, letting researchers figure out where recipients were re-allocating their newly chosen time away from work. Though 1,000 people obviously made a variety of choices over the course of three years, the dominant trade was clearly toward more leisure time.\nI’ve previously written about how, until recently, Americans across the political spectrum used to see the promise of capitalism as exactly that: delivering people the choice of cashing in economic progress for more leisure time. Getting an economic boost and subsequently choosing to work a little less was not seen as a policy failure, but the whole point.\n“But for decades, workers haven’t even been getting that choice because, for the most part, productivity growth has ended up as higher profits and more inequality,” sociologist Aaron Benanav told me last year. “It takes a political movement to cash that out in terms of a reduced workweek.”\nApparently, a generous basic income can at least help nudge that choice back into workers’ lives. After getting an extra $1,000, recipients effectively traded in $125 to get five-and-a-half more hours per month outside of work.\nInterviews with participants paint a much brighter picture than the numbers\nIn addition to the survey data, OpenResearch held voluntary interviews with participants after the transfers ended to hear more about their experiences. Though only nine were recorded, I kept hearing variations on a theme that wasn’t captured in the statistics. (All names were changed by OpenResearch to protect the identities of participants.)\nAs Alina, a single mom living in Chicago, put it: “My whole mind kinda began to shift ... I had to stop myself so that I could have the mental mind shift, the paradigm shift to say, ok, we can actually engage in system planning.”\nOr Celene, who lived with her ex-wife and their kids in a friend’s basement before the transfers helped them get their own home: “It helped my mind clear a little bit because I didn’t feel like as much of a failure.”\nOr Dominic, who lost his job during the pandemic: “The biggest thing it did was allow me a time of peace of mind so I could explore what I really wanted out of life.”\nEveryone seemed to mention how getting unconditional cash was literally changing their minds for the better.\nThe mechanism doesn’t have to be all that mysterious. Everyone faces their own challenges, and people with low incomes especially so. But woven through all the differences is at least one shared consequence: stress. And we already know that stress can literally warp the mind, especially around scarcity. Giving people cash comes with the flexibility to address whatever sources of stress are loudest in their lives, freeing up the mind.\nAnd yet, according to the numbers, the sharp reductions in stress that recipients had in the first year didn’t last, even though they shared these powerful stories after the third year. Which raises an interesting tension: Why is there such a big difference between the extremely positive stories that people are telling about their experiences, and the story that the numbers tell, which basically amounts to a shrug?\nPart of it could be sampling bias: since the interviews were voluntary, maybe only people who had powerful and positive experiences opted in to the voluntary interviews to talk more about them. More broadly, though, there are parts of the human experience — and more specifically, the experience of being a participant in a basic income experiment — that statistics either fail to capture, or even conceal.\nWhen I spoke with Elizabeth Rhodes, who has a joint doctorate in social work and political science, and directed the study for OpenResearch, she explained that all the variation across how people used the money, or what a “good outcome” actually is based on someone’s particular circumstances, made them difficult to capture in top-line statistics.\nOne person might wind up finding better work and taking on more hours thanks to the cash, while another might scale back their hours to spend more time with their kids. Both cases can be good outcomes to the individuals involved, but “as an average treatment effect, where one person worked a lot more, while another worked less, it all kind of averages out.” she said.\nWe should insulate the case for basic income from any potential AI bubbles\nDespite receiving funding from much of the tech world where talk of AI is everywhere, none of the papers published from the Unconditional Income Study mentioned AI at all. That’s a good thing, because as I mentioned earlier, we should insulate the case for basic income from the volatility and unknowns of AI.\nAgainst the backdrop of all the “changing the world as we know it” talk, a number of analysts are beginning to think the AI bubble is already beginning to burst. Maybe it will, and then it’ll inflate again. And maybe one of these go-rounds will actually lead to changes that go beyond the cycles of innovation and technological unemployment we’ve weathered for centuries. Or maybe they won’t. Who knows!\nThe strongest arguments for unconditional income don’t need to rest on speculation. We have a lot of evidence. We have real-world experience from a ton of pilot experiments and lapsed national policies. And we already have an urgent need for better anti-poverty policies, even if there wasn’t an iota more of AI development.\nBreaking the link between basic income and automation would also force us to consider what — if not UBI — actually would be a good policy response to major technological unemployment. Because if we really do all lose our jobs to AI, $12,000 per year isn’t going to cushion the blow much. This is a persistent confusion in debate around basic income: if you’re talking about unconditionally giving people enough to live on indefinitely, you’re either imagining a society of monks, that everyone lives in rural West Virginia, or you aren’t actually talking about basic income at all, at least as it exists in any viable form.\nThe average living wage for a family of four in the US is about $104,000 per year, according to the MIT Living Wage calculator. Even if a guaranteed income on the scale of this study gave the full amount to children (which most proposals do not), the same family would only get $48,000 per year, less than half the living wage. There is no realistic guaranteed income proposal that could serve as a substitute for wages altogether.\nAltman himself has argued for something more nuanced in the past: taxes on AI companies and land values that feed into a social wealth fund where every citizen holds an equal share, receiving a dividend that rises or falls with the fund value.\nThat’s basically a version of UBI that’s styled away from guaranteeing an end to poverty, and toward being able to adapt to runaway economic growth. In addition, maybe we’ll need to consider job guarantees. Or maybe compulsory employment is an iron cage we’ll finally break by more deeply democratizing the economy, and whatever diminishing pools of work remain.\nEither way, basic income advocates are left with a choice. You can welcome fears around AI as an incredibly effective marketing tool to spread awareness for basic income, and then try to jiu-jitsu that attention toward sturdier motivations, like more effectively reducing poverty than a patchwork of means-tested programs. Or, like me, you can try shouting into the void that we shouldn’t associate basic income and automation in the first place, since it sets the case for unconditional cash on shaky foundations, while there’s an empirically sturdy basis already established.\nWith the OpenResearch studies, that basis continues to grow. Whether or not that’ll lead to any policy breakthroughs before AI flops, fades into being just another new technology that shifts things around for a bit, or really does transform the economy, who knows?",

        "text": "For months, lawmakers have been paying attention to and pushing for some form of a universal basic income as the coronavirus pandemic roiled the economy and forced millions of Americans out of a job.\nIt’s the main pillar that former presidential candidate Andrew Yang took up in his campaign, centered around the premise that a UBI could alleviate or resolve many American issues.\nThe gravity with which a UBI is now regarded is a complete reversal of the reaction Yang first got when unveiling his platform. Pundits and Democratic strategists didn’t take his campaign seriously, but suddenly the push for a UBI does not seem so far-fetched.\nJust as the pandemic was taking full shape in the United States, progressives who’ve long criticized Yang’s UBI stance urged in March for direct payments to workers around the country. Among them was Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who in August of last year found fault with instituting a UBI.\nShortly after Sanders and other lawmakers spoke up, President Donald Trump signed into law a coronavirus stimulus package that offered a $1,200 payment to struggling Americans to offset any economic damage brought on by the virus. And now Congress is in discussions about the next round of stimulus relief, with the potential for another $1,200 direct payment.\nAs the conversation around UBI continues, CNBC spoke with Yang on the U.S. response to the pandemic, engaging the White House and how Americans can make a difference in the coming months.\nThe UBI push\nFor many Americans, the $1,200 payment is not enough to cover all their expenses. Still, a whopping 74% of respondents in a CNBC/Change Research poll from May said they supported federal relief payments to help Americans cope with the economic disaster brought on by the pandemic.\n“If you think about it in 2020, 74% might as well be 98%,” Yang said in an interview Tuesday with CNBC ahead of a Verizon event centered around achieving social change. “It’s virtually unanimous.”\nSince ending his presidential bid, Yang launched Humanity Forward, a nonprofit that bolsters UBI, offering endorsements to candidates in support of it up and down the ballot.\nUBI is especially critical in these next coming months, Yang said, as health officials warn that the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus is growing throughout the country.\n“We believe that people need economic relief right now. So we were proud to have distributed $7 million in direct economic aid to folks who are struggling in increments of between $250 and $1,000,” Yang told CNBC.\n“That $7 million is unfortunately just a sliver of the need,” he said. “We have a waiting list of over 100,000 people who have requested additional aid, but we’re certainly proud to take what we have and put it into people’s hands.”\nHumanity Forward urges people to donate to its Covid-19 relief fund online, 100% of which goes to low-income people who are struggling to support themselves, according to the site.\nThe coronavirus response\nBut instituting a UBI at this point would not negate the damage already wreaked by the coronavirus.\nOver a period of weeks in March, the coronavirus spread rapidly from state to state in the country, forcing businesses to shutter and plunging people into joblessness. The effects have continued for months, and dozens of states are experiencing spikes in the number of confirmed cases after apparently reopening their businesses prematurely.\nNearly 33 million people said they were collecting unemployment benefits as of June 20, according to statistics from the Labor Department.\nAs the coronavirus gained steam, the Trump administration downplayed it, in a move that ran counter to the message from health officials. Earlier this month, the White House also made an effort to block funding for testing in the upcoming stimulus relief bill. Trump previously suggested at a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that testing would be slowed down. Later, the White House said he was joking.\nYang did not mince words when he addressed the U.S. response to the pandemic: “It’s been tragic and heartbreaking to see us fail our people on so many levels. And even if you just fast forward to today, like we’re not even doing the things that we should be doing in terms of helping families manage this time and this crisis. We’ve been failing on multiple levels.”\nThe Trump administration has received blowback for its handling of the pandemic, with the president receiving the most dismal marks from voters.\nA Quinnipiac University poll from earlier this month showed that only 35% of voters approved of his response, compared with 62% who indicated disapproval. This rating is the lowest he’s received since March, according to a press release from Quinnipiac University.\n“Thirty percent or more of Americans couldn’t afford housing costs last month, and that’s with extended unemployment benefits and other measures,” Yang said, referring to a figure from online rental platform Apartment List. “So we need to think much bigger about how we can make this economy work for so many Americans. And to me, that starts with putting economic relief directly into their hands.”\n2020 politics\nYang is adamant that Humanity Forward lend a hand wherever possible to make economic relief a reality for Americans.\nSo far, that looks like supporting candidates who believe in and advance the vision of UBI.\nBut that support may extend to the White House if former Vice President Joe Biden wins in November, Yang said.\n“The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the rate of change in our economy where we’ve seen 10 years worth of change in 10 weeks. And so if I have an opportunity to help address some of these problems in a new administration, I would strongly consider it,” Yang said.\nYang endorsed Biden for president in March, and since then he’s stumped for the 2020 presumptive Democratic nominee and has functioned as one of his surrogates on the campaign trail.\n“I continue to make it clear that I think four more years of a Trump presidency would be an utter disaster and that Joe needs to win and become our next president,” Yang told CNBC.\nBut should the Trump administration approach Yang about providing input on how the U.S. should be addressing the crisis, “I’d be happy to advise,” he said, while adding that he believes “this administration only has another few months in office.”\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC asking whether that would be welcome or has ever been under consideration.\nYang did not answer whether he is weighing a bid for New York mayor, as many outlets have been reporting.\nHe also declined to say whether he’s thought about a presidential bid for 2024, saying instead that he’s focused on helping Biden succeed this year and putting his effort into alleviating the tensions brought on by the virus.\nMoving forward\nPerhaps those most suited to make a difference right now are businesses and corporations, Yang told CNBC, speaking ahead of his keynote address at an event called Citizen Verizon Assembly for advancing social change.\nLarge corporations especially have the resources right now to strengthen communities in need of assistance, he said. Many businesses have begun investing in organizations that are pushing for social change or investing in their own initiatives.\nYang encouraged companies to understand the difference between just “adopting messaging around social change versus when they make real commitments and investments.” Financial investment into employees and communities ultimately “helps move us in a better direction,” he said.\nAt the same, it’s understandably tough for businesses to make these investments as they navigate the effects of the pandemic, Yang added.\n“We’ve put many businesses in an impossible situation where we want them to do the right thing by their workers, but they’re subject to economic pressures and reporting deadlines where if they show a downturn in revenue and profitability, then their stock is going to get punished if they’re a public company,” he said.\nThese investments would be part of a larger effort to change the way the economy works for Americans. The backbone of the U.S. economy hasn’t evolved to meet the needs of Americans, Yang said. “We’ve been pretending that our economy is still like it was in the 1970s or ’80s, where you had one job and you stayed at that job for decades,” he said. That job came with health insurance and benefits, things that are not as guaranteed today. Most jobs created today, he said, are gig, temp and contract jobs that don’t have security or benefits to them.\nIn this way, he said, businesses can offer solutions to help and change the scope of the American workforce.\nAnd consumers will respond to their willingness to advance social change. “If a company were just to say, ‘Hey, I’m not in the business of doing good. I just want to operate my business just as if nothing has changed,’ I think that many consumers will probably be less excited about spending their dollars with those companies,” Yang said.",

The effects have continued for months, and dozens of states are experiencing spikes in the number of confirmed cases after apparently reopening their businesses prematurely.\nNearly 33 million people said they were collecting unemployment benefits as of June 20, according to statistics from the Labor Department.\nAs the coronavirus gained steam, the Trump administration downplayed it, in a move that ran counter to the message from health officials. Earlier this month, the White House also made an effort to block funding for testing in the upcoming stimulus relief bill. Trump previously suggested at a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that testing would be slowed down. Later, the White House said he was joking.\nYang did not mince words when he addressed the U.S. response to the pandemic: “It’s been tragic and heartbreaking to see us fail our people on so many levels. And even if you just fast forward to today, like we’re not even doing the things that we should be doing in terms of helping families manage this time and this crisis. We’ve been failing on multiple levels.”\nThe Trump administration has received blowback for its handling of the pandemic, with the president receiving the most dismal marks from voters.\nA Quinnipiac University poll from earlier this month showed that only 35% of voters approved of his response, compared with 62% who indicated disapproval. This rating is the lowest he’s received since March, according to a press release from Quinnipiac University.\n“Thirty percent or more of Americans couldn’t afford housing costs last month, and that’s with extended unemployment benefits and other measures,” Yang said, referring to a figure from online rental platform Apartment List. “So we need to think much bigger about how we can make this economy work for so many Americans. And to me, that starts with putting economic relief directly into their hands.”\n2020 politics\nYang is adamant that Humanity Forward lend a hand wherever possible to make economic relief a reality for Americans.\nSo far, that looks like supporting candidates who believe in and advance the vision of UBI.\nBut that support may extend to the White House if former Vice President Joe Biden wins in November, Yang said.\n“The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the rate of change in our economy where we’ve seen 10 years worth of change in 10 weeks. And so if I have an opportunity to help address some of these problems in a new administration, I would strongly consider it,” Yang said.\nYang endorsed Biden for president in March, and since then he’s stumped for the 2020 presumptive Democratic nominee and has functioned as one of his surrogates on the campaign trail.\n“I continue to make it clear that I think four more years of a Trump presidency would be an utter disaster and that Joe needs to win and become our next president,” Yang told CNBC.\nBut should the Trump administration approach Yang about providing input on how the U.S. should be addressing the crisis, “I’d be happy to advise,” he said, while adding that he believes “this administration only has another few months in office.”\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC asking whether that would be welcome or has ever been under consideration.\nYang did not answer whether he is weighing a bid for New York mayor, as many outlets have been reporting.\nHe also declined to say whether he’s thought about a presidential bid for 2024, saying instead that he’s focused on helping Biden succeed this year and putting his effort into alleviating the tensions brought on by the virus.\nMoving forward\nPerhaps those most suited to make a difference right now are businesses and corporations, Yang told CNBC, speaking ahead of his keynote address at an event called Citizen Verizon Assembly for advancing social change.\nLarge corporations especially have the resources right now to strengthen communities in need of assistance, he said. Many businesses have begun investing in organizations that are pushing for social change or investing in their own initiatives.\nYang encouraged companies to understand the difference between just “adopting messaging around social change versus when they make real commitments and investments.” Financial investment into employees and communities ultimately “helps move us in a better direction,” he said.\nAt the same, it’s understandably tough for businesses to make these investments as they navigate the effects of the pandemic, Yang added.\n“We’ve put many businesses in an impossible situation where we want them to do the right thing by their workers, but they’re subject to economic pressures and reporting deadlines where if they show a downturn in revenue and profitability, then their stock is going to get punished if they’re a public company,” he said.\nThese investments would be part of a larger effort to change the way the economy works for Americans. The backbone of the U.S. economy hasn’t evolved to meet the needs of Americans, Yang said. “We’ve been pretending that our economy is still like it was in the 1970s or ’80s, where you had one job and you stayed at that job for decades,” he said. That job came with health insurance and benefits, things that are not as guaranteed today. Most jobs created today, he said, are gig, temp and contract jobs that don’t have security or benefits to them.\nIn this way, he said, businesses can offer solutions to help and change the scope of the American workforce.\nAnd consumers will respond to their willingness to advance social change. “If a company were just to say, ‘Hey, I’m not in the business of doing good. I just want to operate my business just as if nothing has changed,’ I think that many consumers will probably be less excited about spending their dollars with those companies,” Yang said.\nThere were no giant cheques, but the people who filed into a conference room at the Cook County building in downtown Chicago to fill in forms on a snowy morning late last year had nonetheless won the lottery. On December 15th, 3,250 people were paid $500, either on special debit cards or by direct deposit into their bank accounts. They were picked randomly from over 230,000 applicants by GiveDirectly, a charity that has been brought onto administer the county’s universal basic-income scheme.\nApplicants had to meet only three criteria to qualify: they needed to live in Cook County (which covers the city of Chicago and a large portion of its suburbs) and have a household income of less than 250% of the federal poverty line—about $69,000 for a family of four—and not be claiming from any other similar schemes. The $500 payments will continue monthly for two years. Recipients can do whatever they want with the money, and will continue to receive it as long as they stay in the county.\nSuch universal basic-income (UBI) schemes have been adopted by dozens of local governments across America in the past couple of years. They are paid for by the flood of money made available by the federal government for relief schemes during the worst of the pandemic. The Cook County programme is by far the largest yet. Some revenues from the taxation of marijuana have been set aside to continue the scheme when the federal money runs out. Toni Preckwinkle, the county president, says that her aim for the scheme is to test “good ideas that percolate up from the bottom”, with the hope that “eventually the federal government takes them over.” Yet in a way, the appeal of creating UBIs comes not out of hope, but out of frustration: the failure of the American welfare system to protect the poorest people.\nAmericans who fall on hard times can access a panoply of different schemes, at both a local and a federal level. There are disability benefits; food stamps; section 8 housing vouchers; Medicaid; and unemployment insurance (which is paid for and administered by states, but in crises often expanded federally). Most of this comes with an extraordinary amount of bureaucracy, however, and many people fall through the cracks—for example, because they do not have a permanent address, or they fail to file the right forms, or they do not qualify. Local governments generally do not have the data to even identify the people most in need.\nThat helps to explain why Cook County—together with several other municipalities—has turned to GiveDirectly, which until recently mostly worked in poor countries using money from donors. According to Sarah Moran, the charity’s American country director, working in America requires making trade-offs. In its schemes in Kenya, the charity would sign up every family in a single village—local residents would help guard against fraud. Running a lottery open to such a large number of people however requires more formal checks, but having too many undermines the simplicity of the system. Under the scheme, the winners are asked to provide bank statements or payslips to prove eligibility—but people who cannot supply them, such as undocumented immigrants, can qualify by being interviewed. An algorithm is used to try to spot fraud—such as people applying with multiple identities.\nThe recipients filling in their forms last year were, unsurprisingly, delighted. Among them was Jasper, a 32-year-old father of three who, with his disabled wife and children, has been living in various family homeless shelters for several years, after losing his factory job and then, when he failed to pay his subsidised rent, his section 8 housing. “When I first got the email, I thought it was a scam”, he says. Without a permanent address, he has struggled to find a new job or even open a new bank account; without an income, he cannot get a new home. Food stamps cover the family’s basic needs, and he intends to save the payments until he has enough to put down a deposit for an apartment, and in turn start looking for jobs. The UBI will help him; but such people perhaps should not have to win a lottery to get assistance.",

        "text": "COLETTE SMITH and her husband are both out of work. They had exhausted their savings, when she received a one-time $1,000 cash infusion as part of a scheme run by Neighbourhood Trust, a financial coaching non-profit, and Humanity Forward, an organisation devoted to building support for universal basic income (UBI) founded by Andrew Yang. UBI was the centrepiece of Mr Yang’s run for the Democratic presidential nomination, in which he advocated a guaranteed income of $1,000 a month, a “Freedom Dividend”, as he called it, for every American adult, regardless of their financial circumstances.\nThere are two big hurdles to introducing UBI in America. One is building support for something that sounds, to many, alarmingly socialist. The other is working out how to pay for it. Mr Yang’s campaign for the Democratic nomination may have failed. But on one of these points he has been wildly successful. A recent Stanford study showed that people are warming to the UBI idea. In April 88% of liberals backed it, while support among conservatives rose from 28% before covid-19 to 45%. Universal benefits can be easier for politicians to sell, because they are less vulnerable to the racial politics that have undermined support for welfare spending in the past.\nDreams of a UBI have a peculiar history in America. In 1967 a coalition of welfare recipients, led by African-American women, demanded “decent income as a right”. Martin Luther King wrote about it in his final book. At the other end of the political spectrum, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney drew up a guaranteed minimum-income proposal for President Richard Nixon. Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, beloved of libertarians, were enthusiasts too.\nMore recently, UBI has been taken up by technologists who believe that software will leave a large number of Americans jobless, leading to social unrest. It has also been promoted by some of the organisations which make up the Black Lives Matter movement, who see it as a way to mend racial disparities in wealth.\nMr Yang points out that the approval rating for UBI was only about 25% when he began his presidential run, but by the time he ended it, in February, it was 66%. “The energy around universal basic income has skyrocketed, and it’s going to remain elevated until a bill passes,” says Mr Yang, who believes the job losses caused by covid-19 will not quickly be reversed. In June Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s boss, gave Mr Yang’s organisation $5m to build the case for UBI.\nFunding a generous UBI has always seemed impossible. But many seemingly impossible economic policies have been enacted recently, opening the door to wackier ideas. Under America’s economic-stimulus plan to deal with the fallout from the pandemic, for example, Congress sent $1,200 to every adult. The scheme was so generous that, combined with extended unemployment benefits, aggregate household income is forecast to rise this year.\nIn May more than dozen cities, including Atlanta, Los Angeles, Newark and St Paul, along with the Economic Security Project, launched Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, a network of mayors experimenting with UBI-like schemes. Mr Dorsey has also given money to this group. In February 2019 Stockton, California, began an 18-month experiment to give $500 to 125 randomly selected people. This is being extended for another six months to help participants weather the slump.\nIn Jackson, Mississippi, the Magnolia Mother’s Trust provides poor African-American mothers with $1,000 in cash monthly, no strings attached, for a year. It recently began a larger experiment with 110 participants. Hudson, a small city in upstate New York, recently announced a five-year scheme to give a monthly $500 payment to 20 people. In Newark, New Jersey, Ras Baraka, the mayor, is hoping to get a pilot programme up and running. A third of Newark’s residents live in poverty and have to make tough decisions, Mr Baraka says, like “heat or eat.” Nearly 60% of Newark households carry delinquent debt. But to introduce a proper UBI in Newark, he says, would require federal funding.\nFor all the enthusiasm about UBI experiments, they remain problematic. It is hard to fully evaluate their effect because they are not universal (in the sense of received by everyone). Most take the form of occasional cash payments to poorer Americans. Nor are they generous enough to live on, which is what true UBI believers advocate. Finally, because they tend to be funded by philanthropy, the experiments do not factor in the substantial tax rises that would be needed to pay for them.\nThe proposal Mr Yang ran on would have cost $2.8trn annually, which is about what the federal government spends each year on Social Security (pensions), Medicare (health care for the elderly) and Medicaid (health care for the poor) combined. Even then it would provide adults with no more than $12,000 a year—not enough to lift a workless family with two adults and two children above the federal poverty line.\nA more targeted effort that did not aim to be universal could do much more on that score. Ms Smith, along with 1,000 other residents of the Bronx, received a one-off $1,000 grant from Mr Yang’s outfit. This allowed her to buy food and to restore the internet, which her 14-year-old son needed for remote learning. This helped a great deal. But UBI advocates still have to explain why it would not be better to give families such as hers larger sums rather than a smaller payment that also goes to those who do not need it.",

        "text": "The stereotypical image of public housing in America is one of deteriorating buildings, urban blight, and dysfunctional housing authorities in seemingly never-ending crises. Residents routinely deal with bad living conditions, including heat failures, pest infestations, mold, and leaks. And public housing projects are often found in areas with concentrated poverty and in underserved, racially segregated neighborhoods.\nBy and large, America’s experiment with public housing has been viewed as a failure — so much so that housing authorities have offloaded some of their responsibilities to the private sector.\nTop of Form\nBut the demise of public housing was not an inevitable outcome. As my colleague Rachel Cohen has pointed out, other countries have successfully pulled it off. Governments around the world have shown that they can operate mixed-income housing developments that have reliable maintenance and upkeep and that public housing doesn’t have to segregate poor people away from the middle class.\nSo why did public housing in the United States age so poorly?\nA bold experiment that was designed to fail\nThe federal government’s plans to build public housing started in the 1930s, as part of the New Deal, in an effort to create jobs during the Great Depression and address the country’s housing shortage.\nBut efforts to undermine public housing are about as old as the efforts to build it. From the outset, opposition was fierce. Many Americans didn’t like the idea of the government using their tax dollars to subsidize poor people’s housing, and real estate developers were concerned about having to compete with the government.\nThe Housing Act of 1949, which had a goal of providing “a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family,” bolstered America’s public housing plans by heavily investing in the construction of new housing units. But by then, the federal government had already undermined its own stated plans by capping construction costs (which encouraged using cheap materials and discouraged modern appliances) and allowing racial segregation. Congress had also doomed public housing authorities’ ability to raise revenue through rents in 1936 when it passed the George-Healey Act, which established income limits for who can qualify for public housing — making mixed-income public housing models impossible for federally funded projects.\nAs housing projects started to draw more Black residents, white people who lived in public housing started leaving, especially after the Civil Rights Acts of the 1960s banned racial discrimination in housing. This was partly because the Federal Housing Authority pushed for more people to own homes and expanded its loans mostly to white people, helping white families move out of the projects. Black families didn’t receive the same opportunity.\n“You saw a change in the racial composition, which simply added to the stigma and the pattern of administrative neglect that characterized many housing authorities,” the historian Ed Goetz told The Atlantic in 2015.\nStarting with President Richard Nixon — who declared that the US government had turned into “the biggest slumlord in history” and suspended federal spending on subsidized housing — public housing started facing serious austerity measures and never recovered. Federal investments shifted away from building new public housing units and toward housing vouchers and public-private partnerships.\nIn the decades that followed, public housing started declining in quality, and Congress funded a program to demolish dilapidated public housing units and replace them with newly constructed or renovated mixed-income developments. But according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, those demolitions were an “overcorrection”; public housing simply needed more funding and better management.\nIt didn’t have to be this way\nAmerica’s public housing was an ambitious program that consistently faced efforts by lawmakers to undermine it. Throughout the program’s history, legislation deliberately limited its potential to house Americans as needed. In addition to the George-Healey Act, laws like the 1998 Faircloth Amendment put a ceiling on the number of homes public housing authorities are allowed to own.\nBut that doesn’t mean that public housing in the United States is entirely devoid of successes. The general picture of decay and neglect ignores the many positive experiences people have had living in government-run dwellings. As Goetz, a public policy professor at the University of Minnesota, writes, “The story of American public housing is one of quiet successes drowned out by loud failures.”\nMore than 2 million people live in public housing in the United States, and without it, many of them would struggle to find affordable shelter. Indeed, there are countless stories of people whose lives would be tangibly worse without public housing. Mike Connolly, a Massachusetts state representative who has proposed expanding public housing, is one example. “Personally, I view [public housing] as a success. I was raised in a public housing project in Norwood, Massachusetts,” he told me. “Having that stable environment — not being subject to eviction, not being necessarily subject to a particular cost burden around housing — I think was really terrific for me and gave me the opportunity to develop into someone who has been doing a lot of good things in life.”\nThese bright spots show that there’s a solid foundation that the United States can build on rather than abandon its public housing experiment. “I think of [public housing] as a successful program that has provided low-cost, moderate-quality shelter to millions of people for almost a century across the United States,” Paul E. Williams, the executive director of the Center for Public Enterprise, told Vox. “It has been hampered and limited in its ability to do more by policy mistakes over the past 80 years.”\nSo if America wants to be a public housing success story, it can. It just has to stop sabotaging its own efforts to get there.",

        "domain": "vox.com",
        "text": "When one thinks about America’s housing system, the phrase “easy to use” does not ordinarily come to mind. Buying a house or even just leasing an apartment usually requires thousands in upfront costs, application fees, credit checks, and more. And if you’re applying for affordable housing, the situation is worse. Cities often make applicants jump through ridiculous hoops to even apply for a scarce number of affordable units. In Washington, DC, applicants have to complete an orientation course and then manually enter individual lotteries for each home they’re applying for.\nRecipients of housing choice vouchers (better known as “Section 8” vouchers after the portion of a 1937 federal law authorizing them) have it worst of all. Not only do landlords often discriminate against them, but local housing authorities are underfunded and, once on a waitlist, applicants wait years on average to actually get a voucher. Many housing authorities have closed their waitlists, so if you suddenly hit hard times and need assistance, you’re out of luck. You literally cannot apply.\nBut a collaboration between a team of social scientists and two housing authorities in Seattle suggests things don’t have to be this bleak. The program, called Creating Moves to Opportunity (CMTO), seeks to help Section 8 recipients in the Seattle area find housing in areas where children grow up to make high incomes.\nSome of these researchers had earlier found that opportunity (measured as the share of poor kids who wind up in a higher income bracket as adults) varied widely not just from city to city, but from city block to city block. Their hope was to direct recipients to the blocks whose children have historically prospered as adults.\nThe first results from the initiative came out in 2019 — you can read a story I wrote about it then. Results were promising: The program dramatically increased the share of voucher recipients who moved to high-opportunity neighborhoods. Now, the researchers have come out with new results, and with several years of data, they not only confirm that the program spurs moves to high-opportunity zones, but they explain why it works.\nThe short answer: navigators. CMTO did not simply give voucher recipients information about high-opportunity neighborhoods and then leave them to their own devices. It paired them with “housing navigators,” professional administrators who could help them navigate applying for units and talk to landlords to help leases go through. The help made an enormous difference — for the most recent paper, the researchers experimented with giving some applicants only information and others a fuller package. The group without help was much less likely to move to a high-opportunity neighborhood.\nRaj Chetty, William A. Ackman professor of economics at Harvard and one of the researchers driving this project, told me that standard economic theory wouldn’t predict navigators making this much of a difference. It makes sense that simply getting information would change people’s behaviors, but it’s less clear why having a guide would. Standard economic models assume people act rationally given the information they have, and it seems like learning that a certain neighborhood produces good outcomes for their children should be enough. You shouldn’t need more than the information.\nFor non-economists, though, this conclusion seems quite intuitive. Seattle voucher recipients got good customer service from a government agency — and just as it does nearly everywhere else, that turned out to matter a great deal.\nHow you create moves to opportunities\nThe navigators at the center of the intervention come in two flavors: family navigators, who work with Section 8 families to help in their housing search; and housing navigators, who meet with landlords in high-opportunity neighborhoods and dispel any negative impressions they might have about the Section 8 program and about tenants who might have criminal records or poor credit. Both are contracted through a local nonprofit, the Interim Community Development Association.\nNikkie Manlapaz, a working mom who found a home through this program, told me back in 2019 that the navigators were absolutely essential. She said that in previous housing searches, she relied on “what I heard from friends and on Craigslist. I tried Apartments.com, but it was just basically calling the places on your own, looking at the places on your own, applying and just waiting, and usually the answer’s no.” Thanks to Section 8, she already had the money. But what she needed was an easier process.\nManlapaz said that after she told her navigator she wanted to live in the Northgate, an opportunity neighborhood in northern Seattle, her navigator called to tell her about any vacancies. When she picked one she liked, “they pretty much took care of the rest. I gave them my information, they gave my information to the leasing office, they applied for me, and they helped with the first month’s rent and the renter’s insurance for a year.” In some ways, this is what wealthy people get when they pay for rental brokers or elite real estate agents, whose fees might be high but who can remove some drudgery and uncertainty from the process.\nWhat we’ve learned since 2019 is that this kind of navigation is exactly why the program works. As part of the follow-up study, the authors (Chetty, Peter Bergman, Stefanie DeLuca, Nathaniel Hendren, Lawrence Katz, and Christopher Palmer) split the experiment into three arms, testing three different programs.\nOne group only got information about high-opportunity areas and some short-term financial assistance to help them move; this is the “light” intervention group. The “medium” group got some limited support from navigators, plus information and financial backing. The “heavy” intervention group got the full navigator experience. A control group received a voucher and no additional information or financial support.\nThe results were unequivocal: Families getting the heavy treatment were vastly more likely to move to a high-opportunity area. In the control group, which got no information or assistance, 12.5 percent of families moved to high-opportunity areas. The light intervention increased that share by 8.9 percentage points, but this change wasn’t statistically significant. The medium intervention increased the share moving to a high-opportunity neighborhood to 26.3 percent, a more-than doubling, enough to be statistically significant.\nBut the full treatment increased the share to 53.3 percent — most participants were now moving to high-opportunity areas. It was by far the most effective form of intervention.\nIt was also the most expensive, but even so it hardly breaks the bank: it cost $3,060 per family, compared to $1,001 for the medium intervention and $705 for the light one. Chetty notes that this doesn’t include the fact that some high-opportunity neighborhoods had costlier rents, which meant Section 8’s monthly subsidy costs increased. Over the average life of a voucher (seven years), the program cost and additional rent costs add up to a 17.2 percent increase in the voucher’s total cost for the housing authority.\nNot every housing authority would have to pay that much, though. “There are plenty of opportunity bargains, [neighborhoods] that are not more expensive, where we think kids would do equally as well,” Chetty says. It’s possible that a housing authority could decline to increase subsidies for high-cost areas, wind up only paying $3,060 per family, and still be able to place lots of families in these “bargain” areas.\nEither way, the money seems more than worth it. An earlier paper by Chetty, Hendren, and Katz, analyzing a large-scale experiment run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the 1990s, found that children living in voucher housing who were placed in low-poverty neighborhoods by the experiment saw their earnings rise by 31 percent in their mid-20s, relative to recipients who didn’t move. That’s a huge payoff, and easily adds up to more than $3,000 per person in benefits. College attendance is higher, and single parenthood less common, among adults whose families received the voucher; they’re likelier to live in low-poverty neighborhoods as adults too.\nI’ve been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand\nAfter the 2019 paper, Chetty says, some of his peers in economics were dismissive of the results. They “had the reaction, ‘You just told people where these opportunity neighborhoods are, obviously when you give people information they’ll move to a new place.’” But, he notes, “that turns out not to be what’s going on. If you give people information, and even cash, that doesn’t do it.” What does do it is the navigators: an actual hands-on process helping people navigate the frictions of applying for housing.\nIf that explanation is foreign to some economists modeling rational actors, it’s totally familiar in sociology, where it’s de rigueur to note that people’s behavior is shaped by stigma, institutional behaviors and attitudes, and their own bandwidth for making decisions. Stefanie DeLuca at Johns Hopkins, a prominent sociologist, is a co-author on the new paper and leads a team of 50 interviewers who wound up talking to 119 different families who were part of the experiment. The hope was to give some qualitative sense of what the program was like for participants: what it helped with, what limitations it had.\n“The opening invitation to the interviews is ‘tell me the story of your life,’ and then eventually we move to the phase where they sign up for CMTO and we say ‘tell me about CMTO,’” DeLuca explains. “What was jumping out from that initial question,” she recalls, was “the emotional communication aspect of it. Families were feeling really relieved, supported, optimistic, more confident.”\nMany participants, she recalled, reported “experiences that make them quite pessimistic” with housing in the past. In the paper, she quotes a member of the control group, Arya, who bemoans that during her most recent visit to a prospective apartment, she couldn’t even “get somebody to meet me there that might just sit there with me ... to explain the paperwork.” By comparison, Tina, a mom who did receive CMTO help, reported, “Wow, this program, like they’re with you at all times, they help you, they’re there to guide you.”\nThe navigators’ work was wide-ranging. They could act as emotional support, reassuring applicants that the process was going well and they’d succeed in finding a place. They could act as coaches, helping applicants put together “rental resumés” to win over landlords. They often served as intermediaries who could handle tricky or testy communications with landlords.\nHonestly, the best comparison that comes through in the paper is to a concierge at a hotel. The navigators offered similarly comprehensive help to their clients, the kind of help that government rarely extends to citizens. And that, ultimately, was the most powerful part of the intervention for getting people to lease in high-opportunity areas, the main goal the whole time.\nIt’s a lesson that could have surprisingly far-reaching implications. There aren’t concierges for most government services. If you’re struggling, programs like food stamps/SNAP and Medicaid often enroll you online with no actual person helping out. State human services departments are usually understaffed and ill-equipped to walk people through applications, support them on job searches, and generally “navigate” through the process the way the Seattle navigators did. We spend a whole lot of money on social programs, but they don’t do as much as they could because of the difficulty of access. One in five people eligible for food stamps doesn’t get them, and in a number of states like California and North Carolina, 30 percent don’t get them. Some of that is due to the difficulty of signing up and maintaining benefits.\nThe CMTO results suggest that a concierge model might be worth trying on programs like these as well. People need monetary support, of course. But sometimes they need emotional and logistical support too.",

        "title": "Study: adding low-income housing to poor neighborhoods lowers crime and boosts property values",
        "domain": "vox.com",
        "text": "If there’s one thing absolutely everybody knows about urban politics, it’s that nobody wants low-income housing built in their neighborhood. Breaking up concentrations of poverty by building subsidized housing in affluent areas sounds like a great idea, but rich people veto it. So instead we build it in neighborhoods that are already lower-income and disenfranchised, where it creates further burdens on already troubled places. So when possible, poor neighborhoods also veto creating new low-income housing — which leaves the very poorest residents with nowhere to go.\nExcept a study from Rebecca Diamond and Timothy McQuade of Stanford Business School finds that fear of building low-income housing in poor neighborhoods is entirely misplaced.\nPeople think it will further exacerbate the difficulties of neighborhoods already saddled with difficulties, but the data shows otherwise. Crime rates fall and property values rise when subsidized housing is built in a poor neighborhood.\nWhat the study says\nThey study this looking specifically at housing built using the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), which provides funding for the construction of subsidized housing. By analyzing transaction and demographic data from 129 counties they find the following striking facts:\nNeighborhoods with a median income below $26,000 see a 6.5 percent increase in property values within 0.1 miles of the LIHTC development site.\nBy contrast, in mostly white neighborhoods with incomes above $54,000, there are house price declines of approximately 2.5 percent within 0.1 miles of the LIHTC development site.\nIn low-income neighborhoods, the introduction of affordable housing decreases crime and decreases segregation.\nIn high-income neighborhoods, the introduction of affordable housing does not lead to an increase in crime.\nThis finding is a bit depressing in the context of the behavior of homebuyers in affluent neighborhoods. The low-income housing developments don’t increase crime, but people flee the area anyway out of either racial or class prejudice.\nBut the finding regarding low-income neighborhoods is extremely encouraging.\nIt suggests that adding new low-income housing in certain neighborhoods can be a win-win policy that not only helps families get a place to live but also improves the circumstances of nearby troubled neighborhoods.\nHow this works\nThe authors don’t offer much of a causal theory of why adding low-income housing to an already poor neighborhood serves as effective neighborhood development strategy beyond noting that lowering crime rates would probably raise property values.\nMy guess is that if this result holds up under further scrutiny we will be seeing largely that urban spaces benefit from having more people in them. In an affluent area where housing is already expensive, adding LIHTC developments will likely crowd out market rate developments. But in poorer areas there may be nobody interested in investing in market-rate development. LIHTC development helps because it is development leading to a higher local population, more vibrant streets, more retail, and a general sense of increased activity.",

        "text": "IN THE PAST ten years the homeless population in Los Angeles has risen by 50%. In New York it is 60% up over the same period. San Francisco is widely thought to have America’s worst homelessness problem. Just metres from the headquarters of Twitter and Uber, people lie in the street, stupefied, or defecate in front of the passing traffic. The term “housing crisis” is bandied about too readily. But it is an apt way of describing what is happening in America’s most prosperous cities.\nIt does not have to be this way. Tokyo is as much a global city as San Francisco, yet you can go days without seeing a single person living on the streets. The inhabitants of Zug, a short drive from Zurich, are as rich as the local Kirschtorte. Astonishing wealth, a waterside location and lots of high-tech firms mean that Zug bears more than a passing resemblance to San Francisco. But in Zug there is practically no rough sleeping.\nHomelessness is the extreme manifestation of a problem that governments have tried to tackle for decades. At any one time, at least some people struggle to afford decent housing on private markets. Governments have spent vast sums trying to help the poor into housing and improving conditions. Yet they are failing in their objectives. This is prompting a rethink.\nGovernments began intervening heavily in housing markets following the second world war. They promised to build millions of homes themselves, which they would then rent to their constituents at below-market rates. In America the Housing Act of 1949 authorised the construction of over 130,000 units of public housing a year for six years. In 1950-70 Britain built some 3m units of social housing, and over the same period West Germany put up even more. The Japanese government was equally enthusiastic.\nThe boom ended as governments triumphantly declared that the housing shortage had been solved. At the same time fewer people wanted to live in big blocks of homogeneous flats, especially poor-quality ones: the dash for volume had often caused governments to cut corners. A gas explosion at the Ronan Point block in London in 1968 marked a turning-point in attitudes to public housing in Britain. In the mid-1970s Pruitt-Igoe, an infamous project in St Louis, Missouri, was demolished. Around this time, economists started to think differently about the best way to provide welfare.\nRather than build houses for the poor, many argued, why not give them the money they would need to buy housing on the open market? Recipients of cash payments could then choose the sort of accommodation that suited them best. Others contended that the private sector would deliver superior housing to what the state could provide. Cash benefits also promised to be better targeted at the poor: withdrawing a monthly housing payment to someone who suddenly becomes well off is easier than kicking them out of their home.\nWho is it helping?\nWhat followed was a shift from supply-side to demand-side measures. In the early 1970s Britain started to wind down its programme of social-housing construction, but in its place gave money to poor tenants. France did something similar in the latter part of the decade. In Germany from the late 1980s, housing assets owned by municipalities were transferred to for-profit owners. In America between 1977 and 1997, the number of households receiving housing vouchers increased from 162,000 to over 1.4m.\nThough economists generally prefer cash benefits over the in-kind sort, a growing number are starting to argue that providing cash assistance for housing has not proven to be as effective as expected. Giving people money increases their purchasing power. In a normal market, the increase in effective demand leads suppliers to respond accordingly. Yet the supply of housing in many cities is inelastic: when demand for housing rises, extra supply does not necessarily follow. Instead, the price of housing—which, for most poor people, is rent—goes up.\nIn many cases, therefore, housing benefits help landlords as much as the poor. Some research in England has found that half of the gains from housing benefits accrue to landlords. A paper from 2006 looking at France concludes that a one-euro rise in housing benefits raises rents by 80 cents.\nKanye West reportedly built prototypes of houses inspired by a planet in “Star Wars”\nIf governments respond to rising rents by increasing housing benefits, costs can quickly spiral. Over the long run, cash payments for housing can even cost the government more than providing housing directly (though this is difficult to calculate reliably). Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the private sector is able to fill the gap when the state stops building houses itself. If not, then overall new housing supply falls, making it more expensive for everyone.\nFaced with growing numbers of people unable to afford housing, there are stirrings of a global movement back towards direct provision. Last year Kanye West, a rapper, reportedly built prototypes of dome-shaped houses inspired by Tatooine, a planet in “Star Wars”, which were to be used as low-income dwellings (though after a fight with local residents, the prototypes appear to have been demolished).\nHousing co-operatives are also becoming more popular. A short drive from Zug a group called “mehr als wohnen” opened “Hunziker Areal”, a housing complex, in 2014. Rents in its apartment blocks are generally far lower than the local average. Residents have a say in how the community is run. There are bikes in a “mobility station” for people to borrow and residents can tend a vegetable patch. It is a world away from what many Americans or Britons think when they hear the term “public housing”.\nGovernments have bigger plans. In 2018 Britain built more public housing than in any year since 1992. The South Korean government aims to increase the share of public-rental housing from 7% of the total stock to 9% by 2022. In Germany in 2018-19 the government set aside some €5bn ($5.6bn) to promote the construction of public housing.\nThe best way to make housing more affordable would be to make the supply more responsive to increases in demand. A big underlying reason why homelessness in Tokyo is so low is that housing is reasonably affordable. Meanwhile, Zug builds more than twice as many homes per person as San Francisco. Research suggests that a 10% fall in rents in a high-cost city such as New York results in an 8% decline in the number of homeless residents. Until governments keep overall housing costs under control, the rest is tinkering.",

        "title": "Why everyone is talking about free cash handouts—an explainer on universal basic income",
        "domain": "cnbc.com",
        "text": "The idea of free cash for all may seem too good to be true, but a growing number of high-profile people — from Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang to tech billionaire Elon Musk — say universal basic income, or UBI, may become a reality.\nAnd the rest of America is becoming more interested, too: Google searches for the term “universal basic income” have multiplied as much as 50 times between 2015 and 2019.\nWhat is UBI?\nUniversal basic income refers to regular cash payments made to a given population (such as adult U.S. citizens, for example) with minimal or no requirements for receiving the money, in order to increase people’s income, according to the International Monetary Fund.\nBeyond that, however, there is often disagreement about what constitutes UBI.\n″[T]here is no established common understanding” of UBI, according to economists Maura Francese and Delphine Prady. And therefore, “very different income-support programs are often labeled ‘universal basic income,’ even when they have little in common or do not aim at the same goal.”\nHowever, common variances on the basic tenet include whether cash handouts replace or supplement existing social welfare programs, whether payments are distributed to a household or individual, who foots the bill and how often the payments are distributed.\nWhy is everybody talking about UBI now?\nThere are two main conditions fueling the emergence of UBI as a serious topic over the last few years.\nThe first is fears that automation will put millions of people out of work, leaving them with little or no income.\n“There is a pretty good chance we end up with a universal basic income, or something like that, due to automation,” SpaceX and Tesla boss Elon Musk told CNBC in 2016. “Yeah, I am not sure what else one would do. I think that is what would happen.”\nThis is Andrew Yang’s thinking too. Yang, a 44-year-old entrepreneur running for the Democratic presidential nomination, has made UBI the foundation of his 2020 campaign platform. His plan, which he calls the “Freedom Dividend,” is for the federal government to give all U.S. citizens ages 18 and over $1,000 per month.\nFellow Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders said in 2015 he is “absolutely sympathetic to that approach,” and former Vice President Joe Biden said in 2018 he would consider a UBI as a last resort. Republicans are more likely to be against UBI.\nAmericans, however, are split on whether they would support universal basic income as a solution for those whose jobs are replaced by robots: 48% support and 52% do not, according to a February 2018 Gallup survey.\nThere is also debate as to whether robots will actually take people’s jobs: A 2017 McKinsey & Company report estimates as much as one-third of the U.S. workforce may need to learn new skills and find a new job because of automation by 2030, while a 2017 report from Gartner says artificial intelligence will create more jobs than it eliminates.\nThe other major situation motivating the current conversation about UBI is America’s extreme and growing wealth inequality. Some see cash payments as a way to help even the playing field.\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, for one, falls into this camp.\n“Every generation expands its definition of equality. Now it’s time for our generation to define a new social contract .... We should explore ideas like universal basic income to make sure everyone has a cushion to try new ideas,” Zuckerberg said in his 2017 Harvard commencement speech. After all, he said, it was because he had a financial safety net from his dentist father that he felt free to try something as risky as turning Facebook into a business.\nThe wave of interest in UBI is also inspiring a smattering of experiments and pilot studies with UBI in the U.S.\nThe once-bankrupt town of Stockton, California, initiated an 18-month experiment in February, distributing monthly checks for $500 to 130 randomly selected Stockton residents to mitigate poverty and inequality. Michael Tubbs, the town’s now 28-year-old mayor, decided on the program after reading Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1967 book, “Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?” In the book, King writes: ”... the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.”\nAnd one of the country’s top start-up accelerators’ research arm, Y Combinator Research, has run small-scale tests in Oakland, California, to test and improve procedures ahead of a larger-scale program. In that program, 1,000 randomly selected individuals across two as-yet-undisclosed states will receive $1,000 per month for three years to study the impact of the cash transfer.\nWho pays?\nThat depends on who you talk to.\nHillary Clinton seriously considered running her 2016 campaign for president on a platform built with UBI. But she couldn’t figure out a reasonable way to pay for it.\n“Unfortunately, we couldn’t make the numbers work,” Clinton wrote in her campaign memoir, “What Happened.” “To provide a meaningful dividend each year to every citizen, you’d have to raise enormous sums of money, and that would either mean a lot of new taxes or cannibalizing other important programs. We decided it was exciting but not realistic....”\nOthers believe there is a solution.\nFacebook co-founder Chris Hughes, a UBI supporter, says a guaranteed basic income should be paid for by the wealthiest 1% of society, according to his book, “Fair Shot: Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn.”\nTWEET: Recurring cash payments, directly to the people who need it most, are a proven tool to beat back against the rising tide of #IncomeInequality.\nAnd Yang proposes to pay for UBI by implementing a value-added tax, or VAT, of 10% on goods and services a company produces. “Because our economy is so vast, this would generate between $700 and $800 billion in revenue,” he said on Reddit in 2018. Indeed, Eric Toder of the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Policy Center told CNBC Make It in 2018 that such a VAT in the United States could raise anywhere from $500 billion to $1 trillion, depending on how broadly the tax is applied.\nOne thing is certain, however: It would cost a lot.\n“A truly universal UBI would be enormously expensive,” say Hilary Hoynes and Jesse Rothstein, economics and public policy professors at the University of California at Berkeley. “The kinds of UBIs often discussed would cost nearly double current total spending on the ‘big three’ programs (Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid),” according to their working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in February. They also say these social welfare programs would still be needed even with UBI.\nWill it work?\nCritics say universal basic income is too expensive, that it gives people incentive to be unproductive, that it’s bad for people’s self-worth and that there are more efficient ways to spend government money to help those who can’t support themselves.\n“Just giving $1,000 to everybody in itself is not the right solution” if helping those who need it most in society is the goal, Thomas Piketty, an economist and professor at the Paris School of Economics, told CNBC Make It at Columbia University in March.\nAnd Ian Goldin, a professor of globalization and development at the University of Oxford, argued in the Financial Times that “individuals gain not only income, but meaning, status, skills, networks and friendships through work. Delinking income and work, while rewarding people for staying at home, is what lies behind social decay.”\nNobel laureate in economics Joseph Stiglitz told CNBC in April, “I think there’s a certain dignity from work. Some of my younger students say, ‘Oh there could be a lot of dignity from meditation and from other ways of spending time.’ But I think for most people there will be a real desire to work,” Stiglitz says.\nAs far as the data goes, it’s mixed.\nSome of the news seems positive. For example, left-leaning think tank Roosevelt Institute says a $1,000-a-month payment would actually grow the economy by $2.5 trillion by 2025 if it was paid for by increasing the federal deficit; however, increasing taxes would have no net benefit to the economy.\nAnd some small UBI use cases seem to show that cash handouts help those who receive them in some ways — alleviating emotional stress and helping individuals pay their bills. However, it is not a silver bullet for unemployment.\nFor instance, preliminary results of a two-year experiment in Finland that gave 2,000 unemployed people 560 euros ($638) a month show that, for the first year of the study, 2017, those getting cash payments reported improved well-being. However, there was no effect on employment status. Results for employment status in 2018, the second year of the study, are not yet available.\nA basic income pilot program in Ontario, Canada, launched in April 2017 with a plan to distribute varying monthly payments to more than 4,000 people living on incomes less than $34,000 Canadian (or about $25,925 U.S.) for up to three years via tax credits. In July, the government of Ontario announced it would shut down the program (due to the cost and a change in government leadership), and in August, it said that payments would run through March. But the advocacy group Basic Income Canada Network got some feedback. Responses from 424 participants indicated the payments gave them increased personal agency, relief from anxiety, increased social connection and the ability to invest in things like education and job-hunting.\nThen there are the residents of Alaska, who receive a yearly dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which was launched in 1982 to pass along oil profits to future generations. In 2018, the payment was $1,600. Alaskans reportedly use the money for everything from heating oil and clothing to medical emergencies, travel and student loan payments. And a 2018 study of Alaskans suggests that “a universal and permanent cash transfer does not significantly decrease aggregate employment.”",

        "domain": "cnbc.com",
        "text": "Former United States President Barack Obama believes that ballooning wealth inequality is a threat to society, and that those who have the means should help those who are less fortunate.\n“Right now I’m actually surprised by how much money I got,” the 44th President said in his address to more than 10,000 people gathered in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Tuesday. “There’s only so much you can eat. There’s only so big a house you can have. There’s only so many nice trips you can take. I mean, it’s enough.”\nThe Obamas made more than $20 million between 2005 and 2016 thanks in large part to two lucrative book deals, according to an analysis by Forbes.\nWealthy people should give money to those who are less fortunate, Obama said in the speech, which was his highest-profile appearance since leaving office.\nIn the years from 2009 to 2015, Obama gave more than $1 million to charities, according to Forbes.\n“You don’t have to take a vow of poverty just to say, ‘Well, let me help out... let me look at that child out there who doesn’t have enough to eat or needs some school fees, let me help him out. I’ll pay a little more in taxes. It’s okay. I can afford it,’” Obama said.\n“I mean, it shows a poverty of ambition to just want to take more and more and more, instead of saying, ‘Wow, I’ve got so much. Who can I help? How can I give more and more and more?’ That’s ambition. That’s impact. That’s influence. What an amazing gift to be able to help people, not just yourself.”\nThere have been significant improvements in global health and prosperity over the last hundred years, but many have been left behind, the former President said.\n\n“While globalization and technology have opened up new opportunities, have driven remarkable economic growth in previously struggling parts of the world, globalization has also upended the agricultural and manufacturing sectors in many countries. It’s also greatly reduced the demand for certain workers, has helped weaken unions and labor’s bargaining power,” Obama said.\n“And the result of all these trends has been an explosion in economic inequality. It’s meant that a few dozen individuals control the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of humanity. That’s not an exaggeration, that’s a statistic,” he said.\nIndeed, 42 people have the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of the world, according to a study released in January by the global charity Oxfam. And 82 percent of the money made in 2017 went to the wealthiest 1 percent of the global population, the report says.\nMany of America’s richest agree that extreme wealth inequality is a detriment to the economy.\n“As the economy evolves, it reallocates resources,” billionaire Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said on PBS Newshour in 2017. “Now, the real problem, in my view, is ... the prosperity has been unbelievable for the extremely rich people.”\n“If you go to 1982, when Forbes put on their first 400 list, those people had [a total of] $93 billion. They now have $2.4 trillion, [a multiple of] 25 for one,” Buffett said. “This has been a prosperity that’s been disproportionately rewarding to the people on top.”\nMark Zuckerberg, the billionaire founder and CEO of Facebook, has expressed a similar sentiment. “We have a level of wealth inequality that hurts everyone,” Zuckerberg said in his May 2017 commencement address at Harvard. “Let’s face it: There is something wrong with our system when I can leave [Harvard] and make billions of dollars in 10 years, while millions of students can’t afford to pay off their loans, let alone start a business.”\nBillionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson has said a universal basic income, or a free cash handout from the government to all citizens, should be implemented as a solution to wealth inequality. “A basic income should be introduced in Europe and in America,” Branson told The New York Times in June, responding to the question, “What do you think those in positions of power should do to address social problems like income inequality?”\n“It’s a disgrace to see people sleeping on the streets with this material wealth all around them,” Branson said.\nWorkers left behind\nIn particular, the new economy has left behind those with outdated skill sets, Obama noted.\n“For once solidly middle-class families in advanced economies like the United States, these trends have meant greater economic insecurity, especially for those who don’t have specialized skills, people who were in manufacturing, people working in factories, people working on farms,” Obama said.\nObama suggested that alternative solutions like the controversial basic income, or even reshaping the workweek, ought to be considered to address the rapidly evolving workforce.\n“The biggest challenge to workers in countries like mine today is technology,” he said, awknowledging that an increasingly automated workforce is expected to displace a large number of workers in coming years, while changing the nature of work for many others.\n“And so we’re going to have to consider new ways of thinking about these problems, like a universal income, review of our workweek, how we retrain our young people, how we make everybody an entrepreneur at some level,” Obama said. “But we’re going to have to worry about economics if we want to get democracy back on track.”\nCurbing wealth and power inequality\nWith extreme wealth comes extreme power, Obama said.\n“In every country, just about, the disproportionate economic clout of those at the top has provided these individuals with wildly disproportionate influence on their countries’ political life and on its media; on what policies are pursued and whose interests end up being ignored,” Obama said.\nThis pervasive gap between the rich and the poor in terms of both money and power is fundamentally bad for society as a whole, the former President said.\n“History shows that societies which tolerate vast differences in wealth feed resentments and reduce solidarity and actually grow more slowly,” Obama said. “And when economic power is concentrated in the hands of the few, history also shows that political power is sure to follow — and that dynamic eats away at democracy.”\nThe way forward, Obama said, is for political systems to protect all participants and for the wealthy to contribute to the larger benefits of society.\n“For almost all countries, progress is going to depend on an inclusive market-based system,” Obama said, “one that offers education for every child; that protects collective bargaining and secures the rights of every worker; that breaks up monopolies to encourage competition in small and medium-sized businesses; and has laws that root out corruption and ensures fair dealing in business.”\nHe also called for progressive taxation, where “rich people are still rich, but they’re giving a little bit back to make sure that everybody else has something to pay for universal healthcare and retirement security, and invests in infrastructure and scientific research that builds platforms for innovation.”",

        "domain": "cnbc.com",
        "text": "2019 was the year many asked the question: Should billionaires exist?\nIncome inequality in the United States is at its highest level in at least 50 years, according to one measurement from the government’s Census Bureau. In January, Oxfam reported that the world’s wealthiest 26 individuals, as of 2018, had the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of the population.\nThere were 2,153 billionaires as of March, with the ultra-rich worth $8.7 trillion, according to Forbes.\nIt’s against this backdrop that a number of billionaires addressed the issue of inequality, some with progressive agendas to improve American capitalism, the same system that allowed them to become some of the world’s wealthiest people.\nBill Gates\nNet worth: $108.1 billion, according to Forbes\nWhat he said: “There’s no free lunch here. You’d have to collect more money,” Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in February, about raising taxes. “As you go about doing this additional collection, of course you want to be progressive. You want the portion that comes from the top 1% or top 20% to be much higher,” Gates said.\nEven as he supports higher taxes, Gates believes in the fundamentals of capitalism: “You have market-based pricing. You let people create new companies very easily,” Gates told Zakaria. “If you think there’s a lot of competition someplace, you come in and intervene on that.”\nThat system should not be overturned, he said.\n“Flirting with radical change, dramatic change, how we run these systems, I personally — my vote will be not to make a radical change,” he said.\n“Now you can say I’m biased because this system has worked very well for me, and I feel — I plead guilty to that. But as I look overall at the capitalist economies, there are a lot of good things ... and I think you can tune the tax parameters and get way more equity and get some additional government services and still be in the same basic framework,” he said.\nRay Dalio\nNet worth: $18.7 billion, according to Forbes\nWhat he said: “Capitalism needs to be reformed. It doesn’t need to be abandoned. So like anything, like a car, like anything, a plane, a school system, anything, it needs to be reformed in order to work better,” Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest and most profitable hedge fund, said in July on CBS’ “60 Minutes,” explaining that the U.S. economy is not “redistributing opportunity.”\nDalio went as far as to say, “I think the American dream is lost.”\nThe current situation is not sustainable, according to Dalio: “We’re at a juncture. We can do it together, or we will do it in conflict, that there will be a conflict between the rich and the poor,” Dalio said.\nIn November on LinkedIn, Dalio spoke out again, saying, “The world has gone mad and the system is broken. ... Because the ‘trickle-down’ process of having money at the top trickle down to workers and others by improving their earnings and creditworthiness is not working, the system of making capitalism work well for most people is broken.”\nMarc Benioff\nNet worth: $6.9 billion, according to Forbes\nWhat he said: “Capitalism, I acknowledge, has been good to me,” Mark Benioff, the co-founder of Salesforce, wrote in The New York Times in November. “But capitalism as it has been practiced in recent decades — with its obsession on maximizing profits for shareholders — has also led to horrifying inequality.”\nBenioff’s op-ed in the Times calls for a “new capitalism,” which among other things would include higher taxes on America’s richest, including himself. “Nationally, increasing taxes on high-income individuals like myself would help generate the trillions of dollars that we desperately need to improve education and health care and fight climate change,” he wrote.\nMark Zuckerberg\nNet worth: $75.7 billion, according to Forbes\nWhat he said: “I don’t know if I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have, but at some level no one deserves to have that much money,” Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said of billionaires during a live-streamed question and answer session in October. “I think if you do something that is good, you get rewarded, but I do think some of the wealth that can be accumulated is unreasonable.”\nHe also said extreme wealth at the hands of a few, if they choose to spend it to better society, might be better than the alternative of the government controlling all of the wealth. “At some level it is not fair, but it may be optimal,” he said, “or better than the alternative. The alternative would be the government chooses all of the funding for all of the stuff.”\n(Some experts have argued that even through philanthropy, the rich have a disproportionate or unfair influence on society, and Rob Reich, a political theorist at Stanford and author of “Just Giving: Why Philanthropy Is Failing Democracy and How It Can Do Better,” even called it “plutocratic.”)\nMark Cuban\nNet worth: $4.1 billion, according to Forbes\nWhat he said: “The biggest issue for entrepreneurs, for capitalists, for those of us who are successful is, if someone is only going to be paid by the hour ... they’re always going to fall behind,” Cuban told Recode Decode with Kara Swisher at the 2019 SALT Conference in Las Vegas in June. “And income distribution is … [the] disparity is going to get wider and wider.”\nSo, said Cuban, “We as entrepreneurs have got to make a point to give stock to everybody that works for us. Period. End of story. No exceptions, because that’s the only way people are going to get any type of equity appreciation.”\n“Capitalism isn’t bad. It’s when capitalists don’t pay attention” that “bad things can happen,” Cuban said. “Our country is a lot like running a business ... you can’t just look at the short term in the immediate aspect, you’ve got to look at the long term.”\nWarren Buffett\nNet worth: $88.8 billion, according to Forbes\nWhat he said: “I’m a card-carrying capitalist,” Buffett told Andrew Ross Sorkin in May at the annual meeting for the investing firm which he heads, Berkshire Hathaway. The Omaha weekend event is called “Woodstock for Capitalists,” Sorkin notes in his column in the New York Times.\n“I believe we wouldn’t be sitting here except for the market system,” he told Sorkin. “I don’t think the country will go into socialism in 2020 or 2040 or 2060.”\nBuffett supports capitalism because the market economy is productive and generates wealth.\n″[T]he most important single thing is to have more ‘golden eggs’ to distribute around,” Buffett said in February in an interview with CNBC’s Becky Quick. “So I don’t wanna do anything to the goose that lays the golden eggs. And we’ve had the goose that lays more and more golden eggs over the years, unbelievable in this country.”\n“So we’ve got something that works in terms of the market system in terms of turning out lots of goods and services people want,” Buffett said.\nThat being said, Buffett also says the United States ought to use the wealth generated by that “golden goose” to take care of those who are otherwise good people but don’t have skills that the market economy values.\n“A rich family can handle if they’ve got six children and one of them isn’t as good in the market ... is just good in every other personal quality. They take care of him,” Buffett told Quick. “So we can take care of people and we should. But we shouldn’t screw up the market system.”\nJamie Dimon\nNet worth: $1.7 billion, according to Forbes\nWhat he said: Socialism is not a viable solution, said Dimon in his annual letter to shareholders published in April.\n“When governments control companies, economic assets (companies, lenders and so on) over time are used to further political interests – leading to inefficient companies and markets, enormous favoritism and corruption,” Dimon wrote in the letter, which was released with the bank’s 2018 annual report.\n“Socialism inevitably produces stagnation, corruption and often worse – such as authoritarian government officials who often have an increasing ability to interfere with both the economy and individual lives – which they frequently do to maintain power. This would be as much a disaster for our country as it has been in the other places it’s been tried,” he added.\nThe CEO of JPMorgan Chase was unequivocal in his support of capitalism as the best, yet still imperfect, economic system.\n“There is no question that capitalism has been the most successful economic system the world has ever seen. It has helped lift billions of people out of poverty, and it has helped enhance the wealth, health and education of people around the world. Capitalism enables competition, innovation and choice,” Dimon wrote.\nThat being said, like Buffett, Dimon also said the governments of capitalistic economies ought to support those who are struggle.\n“This is not to say that capitalism does not have flaws, that it isn’t leaving people behind and that it shouldn’t be improved. It’s essential to have a strong social safety net – and all countries should be striving for continuous improvement in regulations as well as social and welfare conditions,” Dimon wrote.",

        "title": "Wealth gap grows as rising corporate profits boost stock holdings controlled by richest households",
        "domain": "cnbc.com",
        "text": "The rich really are getting richer.\nTwo Federal Reserve economists recently examined the evidence and concluded the gap is getting even wider.\nFederal Reserve Board economists Isabel Cairo and Jae Sim found that the inequality gap has risen because owners of assets like real estate and stocks are benefiting from the rise of corporate power and rising profits, along with the decline of labor.\n“The before-tax profits share of U.S. corporations has shown a dramatic increase in the last few decades,” the authors wrote. The rise of corporate profits was strongly correlated with the decline of labor. “This correlation suggest that the rise of the profit share and the fall of the labor share may have been driven by a common cause,” they said.\nStagnating wage growth and higher corporate profits have led to a rise in two forms of inequality: in income (the income share of the top households rising steadily), and wealth (the net worth of the top 5% of households increasing 186% from 1983 to 2016), largely because of capital gains.\nThis is evident when looking at data on stock ownership. While an oft-quoted Gallup Poll indicated that 55% of households own stock in 2020, it is the very wealthy who control almost all of this asset. A separate Federal Reserve report indicates the top 10% of households by net worth control 87.2% of the equities in this country at the end of the first quarter. While the top 1% have always controlled 70% to 80% of stock market value since record-keeping began in 1989, this is the highest level of ownership ever, other than the fourth quarter of 2019, when it was 88.1%.\nWho owns stocks:  Households by net worth\nTop 1%         51.8%\nTop 90-99%  35.4%\n50%-99%      12.1%\nBottom 50%    0.7%\n(Q1 2020)\nSource: Federal Reserve\nFor Ivory Johnson, head of Delancey Wealth Management and a member of the CNBC Advisory Council, these statistics are emblematic of the growing perception gap between Wall Street and Main Street.\n“The majority of people don’t own stocks and they don’t care the Nasdaq is up 30 percent this year,” he told me.\nWhile the wealth gap has been growing for decades, Johnson lays part of the problem at the feet of the Federal Reserve, who he says has been propping up stock prices for years.\n“Twenty percent of U.S. companies are zombie companies — they only survive because the Federal Reserve is propping them up. You have a safety net for stocks provided by the Fed, but only a limited version of that for people who really need help.”\nBroader wealth statistics recently published by the Federal Reserve are not much more encouraging.  There is an equally wide gap between what the wealthy own and what the bottom 50% own.\nIt’s largely real estate.\nThe top 1% have 12.8% of their net worth in real estate. The bottom 50% have 54.4% in real estate.\nIt’s the other way around for stocks. The top 1% have 34% of their net worth in stocks, the bottom 50% have only 2.2%. The very wealthy also have much more of their wealth tied up in private businesses and “other assets.”\nTop 1% of households: Assets\nEquities                     34%\nOther assets                22.4%\nPrivate businesses      21.7%\nReal estate                 12.8%\nPensions                     5.9%\nConsumer durables  3.2%\nSource:  Federal Reserve\nBottom 50% of households: Assets\nReal estate               54.4%\nConsumer durables   20.4%\nOther assets                12%\nPensions                     9.4%\nEquities                      2.2%\nPrivate businesses      1.7%\nSource:  Federal Reserve\nWhat to do? Cairo and Sim go so far as to suggest higher taxes on the wealthy as a means to redistribute wealth: “Carefully designed redistribution policies can be quite effective macroprudential policy tools and more research is warranted in this area.”\nJohnson says taxing the wealthy isn’t going to work, and not just because the rich have lobbyists. “You can tax wealthy people 100 percent and it won’t cover the deficit,” he told me. “The question is, what is fair and what will work?”\nThe news is not entirely grim. Edward Wolff, an NYU economics professor who has studied wealth distribution trends for many years, said the poor could see higher returns, even on their lesser investments.\n“The authors appear to miss the fact that the poor have relatively higher debt and therefore leverage,” he said in an email. “What this means is that the poor actually have a higher rate of return on their portfolio than the rich and see greater growth on their wealth over time from capital gains.”",

        "text": "Democratic capitalism, for all its shortcomings, remains the greatest engine of widely-shared prosperity the world has ever known. History rendered judgment on this question in the momentous year of 1989, when communist regimes in Europe began to fall. Yet today both democracy and capitalism are under siege from populists of the left and right, around the world, and in the country whose economic and political model seemed vindicated by the Cold War’s result: the United States.\nmajor reason for democratic capitalism’s legitimacy crisis: the gap between this country’s rich and all others grew significantly in the three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Addressing the wealth gap — especially that part which reflects long-standing racial disparities — could help improve opportunity and social mobility for Americans and bolster the political standing of U.S. institutions, at home and globally. We will take on the issue in a series of editorials, beginning with this one.\nFirst, the data: The combined wealth of all households in the United States added up to $129.5 trillion in the first quarter of this year. The wealthiest 1 percent held 32.1 percent of the total, up from 23.4 percent in 1989. The top 10 percent of households owned $70 of every $100 in household wealth, up from $61 in 1989. The bottom half, whose share never exceeded 5 percent, now holds just 2 percent of household wealth in the United States.\nThough wealth inequality has grown in other industrialized democracies too, the U.S. figures mark this country as an outlier. A 2018 study of 28 countries in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development found that, on average, the top 10 percent of households owns 52 percent of wealth, while the bottom 60 percent owns 12 percent. But in the United States the top 10 percent held 79.5 percent and the bottom 60 percent held 2.4 percent.\nWe focus on wealth inequality rather than income inequality because, while both are important, wealth is a better measure of an individual or family’s long-term economic success and of their stake in society. Real property, securities, cash savings and other assets accumulate over time and can be handed down from generation to generation. A secure middle class that can afford to educate its children and has savings available for retirement as well as the proverbial “rainy day” forms the foundation of a stable, politically moderate community. Conversely, millions who have nothing to lose are comparatively susceptible to demagogues, especially if there is some basis for believing that the system is “rigged” in favor of a hereditary overclass. The United States is not a plutocracy, but billionaires — from the Koch brothers on the right to George Soros on the left — can and do punch far above their weight in U.S. politics.\nThe pursuit of individual wealth is not only natural; it is laudable, as a reward for risk-taking, innovation, artistic creativity and efficient production, whose benefits spill over to society as a whole. Throughout history, societies that arbitrarily confiscated property failed while those that lawfully protected it flourished. The United States may have far more wealth inequality than Japan and Western Europe; but no country in the industrialized world seeks zero wealth inequality, or anything close.\nBut the current U.S. wealth gap is far larger than needed to reward initiative or to sustain rapid economic growth. To the contrary, over the past three decades, economic growth rates have slowed even as more and more wealth has been concentrated at the top. Much contemporary wealth accumulation seems to be of the least defensible kind: that which results from financial windfalls, speculation — or inherited privilege. Certainly the yawning wealth gap between White people and Black people, the legacy of deliberate racist policies, presents a special moral challenge, deserving of especially urgent policy attention.\nIt is probably no coincidence the rich began getting so much richer as globalization exerted downward pressure on wages and deregulated financial innovation increased opportunities for capital gains. A side effect of low interest rates, engineered by the Federal Reserve with the goal of stimulating the broader economy, has been to reduce the costs and raise the benefits of speculation. Absent Fed action, workers and low-income people could have suffered even more from both the Great Recession and the pandemic. It is still remarkable — and concerning — that wealth inequality grew, during the pandemic, mainly due to soaring house and stock prices. Of $13.5 trillion in new household wealth added during 2020, more than 70 percent accrued to the top fifth of income earners, and about a third to the top 1 percent, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nThe wealth gap did not develop overnight. It neither can, nor should, be entirely eliminated; but the United States could aim for a more equitable distribution similar to that of our peer nations today — and, indeed, that which prevailed in the country during the era of its greatest international prestige. Policy reforms, starting now, could make it happen.",

        "domain": "nytimes.com",
        "text": "America is more prosperous than ever.\nU.S. household net worth reached a new peak at the end of 2024. The unemployment rate has levitated just above record lows for three years. The overall debt that households are carrying compared with the assets they own is also near a record low.\nBut even a land of plenty has its shortcomings, influencing both perceptions and realities of how Americans are doing.\nThe U.S. economy remains deeply unequal, with vast gaps in wealth and financial security persisting even as inflation has ebbed and incomes have risen. And data designed to capture the overall population may be obscuring challenges experienced by a broad range of Americans, especially those in the bottom half of the wealth or income spectrum.\nThe share of wealth held by families in the top 10 percent has reached 69 percent, while the share held by families in the bottom 50 percent is only 3 percent, according to the latest reading from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. (When future income claims from Social Security benefits are included, the bottom 50 percent hold 6 percent of total wealth.)\nAnd while wealth has risen for the less wealthy half of the population in recent years, much of the uptick has been locked up in what financial analysts call “illiquid assets” — gains in home prices and stock portfolios — which are not easily translated into cash to pay for bills and expenses that are much higher than they were a few years ago.\nAlthough the bottom 50 percent holds only a 1 percent share of all financial market wealth, six in 10 adults report owning some amount of stock. A broad range of Americans may be frustrated by the inaccessibility of this illiquid wealth, said Daniel Sullivan, research director at the JPMorganChase Institute, which tracks the finances of millions of U.S. bank account holders.\n“‘Massive home equity gains, and my 401(k) is way up, but I can’t touch that, either!’” Mr. Sullivan explained, channeling the tension many people feel.\nDespite the growth in overall wealth, economic confidence among American households has not returned to where it was before the pandemic. That was the case even before consumer sentiment readings — along with the stock market — were dampened by the prospect of an inflationary global trade war from President Trump’s tariff campaign. But what is also striking in the data is the increasing gap in perceptions along income lines.\nOver the past four years, the University of Michigan’s monthly survey of consumer sentiment has shown those in the bottom two-thirds of income to be deeply pessimistic about the economy — with rock-bottom ratings more common during periods of deep recession, including the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn contrast, sentiment among the top third of earners recently rebounded after falling from prepandemic levels.\n“Higher-income people drive most of aggregate spending,” said Joanne Hsu, an economist and director of the Michigan survey. “They were on an upward surge of sentiment between 2022 and 2024, and that’s consistent with their strong spending.”\nPart of the disconnect may stem from the tendency among economists to track income progress primarily through percentage change rather than dollar amounts.\nEven when inflation was peaking around 9 percent and diluting income growth, Ms. Hsu explained, “a 10 percent boost to middle and especially higher incomes is money that feels real, like you can do something with it.”\nFor someone making $100,000, that means a $10,000 raise. But a 10 percent increase at the bottom, perhaps to an hourly wage of $16.50 from $15, “means you’re still living hand-to-mouth,” she added.\nIn a recent report, Matt Bruenig, the president of the People’s Policy Project, a liberal think tank, evaluated the long-running question in U.S. economics of how many adults are living paycheck to paycheck — a term plagued, he said, by “inherent ambiguities.”\nDrawing on data from the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, conducted annually by the Federal Reserve Board, Mr. Bruenig noted that “if we define someone as living paycheck to paycheck if they either say they do not have three months of emergency savings or say they cannot afford a $2,000 emergency expense,” then 59 percent of American adults are “living paycheck to paycheck.”\n‘Loss Aversion’\nOne force behind the lingering dour mood may be more psychic, more intangible, than economic data can easily detect, according to Chris Wheat, the president of the JPMorganChase Institute.\nLess wealthy Americans, both middle and working class, he said, may still be reckoning with “the psychological effect” of the volatility brought about by the pandemic and postpandemic period of 2020 to 2023, which brought both positive and negative swings in cash savings.\nLump sums of direct federal aid in 2020 and 2021 helped tens of millions of households pay down debts, save more of their income and get a brief taste of what living standards were like well above their usual income.\nThat aid, as expected, ended. And there has been a harsh comedown from those highs.\nInflation-adjusted income and inflation-adjusted spending for the typical household fell significantly from 2021 to 2023, research from the JPMorganChase Institute found, using data from more than eight million bank account holders. In essence, purchasing power decreased.\nDuring the same period, checking account balances remained in a historically healthy position across all income cohorts. Yet cash savings have fallen ever since peaking in 2021.\nA variety of goods and services have become more expensive, “but people’s spending habits didn’t change,” Mr. Wheat said.\nWhen financial gravity resumed, lower- and middle-income households that had received aid were forced to resume relying primarily on their labor income to cover expenses.\nThat, Mr. Wheat said, appears to have prompted a serious case of what both psychologists and economists call “loss aversion” — the human proneness to more painfully feel what has been lost than to notice what has been gained. The earnings growth that most workers captured, to average hourly earnings of $31 in January 2025 from $23 in January 2019, didn’t feel as good as inflation felt bad.\nMost economists believe it was appropriate for the extraordinary aid of 2020-21 that enlarged household bank accounts to end. And some argued that it should have ended sooner.\nBut being nudged back into tighter budgeting again, after gaining more financial breathing room, however briefly, can be “frustrating,” Mr. Wheat noted.\nHouse-Rich(er), Cash-Thin(ner)\nHome prices have boomed since 2020. And about half the net worth of the less wealthy 50 percent is in real estate. But the major boost in home prices experienced by owners in this half of the population has often not been felt.\nFor one, a higher home appraisal cannot cover higher grocery bills. And with interest rates high and housing scarce, it is often infeasible to buy a first home or move to another one.\nThat, too, is probably suppressing economic sentiment among those with fewer financial resources in their family, Ms. Hsu of the University of Michigan said.\nThe homeownership rate for adults under 35, which peaked in 1980 at 50 percent, has fallen to 30 percent. Estimates from economists at the National Association of Home Builders in 2024 indicated that about half of American households could not afford a $250,000 home and that a large majority could not afford a median-priced home, now $419,000.\nThe state of the housing market — largely frozen for about three years — may be dimming the economic outlook of even higher-income families. A large crop of homeowners over the past couple of years have been looking to move, for family or work. Rationally, they cherish their cheap, fixed-rate mortgages from the era of lower interest rates, and catch sticker shock at the prospective monthly payment for a similar home at present rates and prices.\nOne fascinating divot in the broader personal finance landscape, however, is that elevated interest rates — which have a dampening effect on industries like housing — have given a major personal income boost to millions of households, if only those that have an ability to save (after taxes and expenses).\nResearch teams at large U.S. banks are finding that these savers are allocating a greater proportion of their cash balances to high-yield savings accounts that earn more interest, a direct result of higher interest rates. Personal interest income hit a record high of $2.1 trillion in January.\nSo for high-income households, total cash reserves are most likely much higher even if checking account balances are down, a report from the JPMorganChase Institute notes.\nFor lower-income bank account holders, “it’s not dark, but it’s not quite as rosy,” Mr. Sullivan concluded.\nThe Shadow of Tariffs\nHistorically, consumer sentiment tends to improve after an inflation shock, or a recession, with the passage of time during economic expansions. It gives households a chance to adjust to new prices, or a new job market, and move forward.\nBut a large and diverse group of economists and investors are arguing that the zigzagging nature of Mr. Trump’s tariff campaign is needlessly adding inflation danger and growth uncertainty to the relatively stable path that the economy was on before he re-entered office.\nThe financial market sell-off this past month and recent plummets in sentiment have “been driven by policy uncertainty largely stemming from tariffs and tariff threats,” said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.\nThe president and his advisers, however, have presented any potential recession, or uptick in consumer inflation that may result from their policies, as a price that may need to be paid for the economy to emerge stronger.\nBelief in Mr. Trump’s ability to steer the economy played a key part in his election victory. And he promised to lower prices and ease the cost of living upon entering office. But public approval of his handling of the economy is only 39 percent, with just 32 percent of respondents approving of his approach to the cost of living, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.\nFinancial forecasters at major Wall Street firms have, for their part, taken their previously low recession probability ratings and raised them significantly.\nBut several analysts remain focused less on recession calls than on trying to make sense of why so many people are feeling down about their economic lives.\nOwen Davis, a labor economist and research fellow at the Siegel Family Endowment — a nonprofit that funds education and work force research — believes that questions of economic dissatisfaction and the constant deliberation in recent years over whether the U.S. economy is, or isn’t, heading into a recession “often get lumped together” in unhelpful ways.\n“We need to be able to have two different conversations about the economy,” Mr. Davis argues — one about the overall size, steadiness and direction of “the ship,” and another about its quality.\n“We need to be able to distinguish between the question of whether the ship is sinking,” he said, “and the question of whether the accommodations on the ship are adequate.”",

The gray bar in between represents the size of the gap: The longer the bar, the larger the distance between the groups.\nHere are the top 10 places with the highest income inequality in the U.S.:\nConnecticut\nAverage annual income of bottom 99 percent: $67,700\nAverage annual income of top 1 percent: $2.5 million\nNew York\nAverage annual income of bottom 99 percent: $49,600\nAverage annual income of top 1 percent: $2.2 million\nMassachusetts\nAverage annual income of bottom 99 percent: $61,700\nAverage annual income of top 1 percent: $1.9 million\nWyoming\nAverage annual income of bottom 99 percent: $60,900\nAverage annual income of top 1 percent: $1.9 million\nWashington, D.C.\nAverage annual income of bottom 99 percent: $61,100\nAverage annual income of top 1 percent: $1.9 million\nCalifornia\nAverage annual income of bottom 99 percent: $55,200\nAverage annual income of top 1 percent: $1.7 million\nNew Jersey\nAverage annual income of bottom 99 percent: $65,100\nAverage annual income of top 1 percent: $1.6 million\nFlorida\nAverage annual income of bottom 99 percent: $39,100\nAverage annual income of top 1 percent: $1.5 million\nIllinois\nAverage annual income of bottom 99 percent: $52,200\nAverage annual income of top 1 percent: $1.4 million\nWashington\nAverage annual income of bottom 99 percent: $57,100\nAverage annual income of top 1 percent: $1.4 million\nThe states with the biggest gaps, Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts, “have well-documented ,” the report says.\nWyoming, another state near the top, is home to part of the Jackson metro area, which also stretches across the border into Idaho. Jackson is the “most unequal location in the entire country,” thanks in part to extremely wealthy residents like former Vice President Dick Cheney and Walmart heiress Christy Walton, one of the richest billionaires of 2018. The average 1 percenter there makes an astounding $16.2 million a year.\n“Our visualization highlights the yawning gap between the top 1 percent of earners and the bottom 99 percent,” says How Much, and, “indeed, the gap is staggering.”",
