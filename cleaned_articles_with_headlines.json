    "text": "A demonstrator holds a \"Tax The Rich\" sign during a protest near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, on Thursday, April 10, 2025. As the United States reaches its 250th year, the widening gulf between the very rich few and the rest of us has become glaringly apparent. In 2024, the richest 10% held over 67%  of household wealth in the U.S., while the bottom half held just 2.4%. This wealth increasingly entitles one to power and privilege: there are numerous billionaires in key positions in the Trump Administration, and some (including the President) have used their public offices for financial gain. The Founders would be horrified by these developments because they believed great wealth in politics would corrupt and destroy the republic. Those beliefs were shaped by a range of influences: the widely read works by Roman historians who blamed the empire\u2019s decline on a widening gap between rich and poor; radical Protestants who called for a Godly republic with limits on property or even its redistribution in a Great Jubilee every 50 years; James Harrington\u2019s 1656 novel Oceana, describing an island country with a constitution that gave land to all and placed explicit limits on income and wealth; Enlightenment philosophers, particularly John Locke\u2019s Two Treatises of Government (1689), which argued \u201call Men by Nature are equal\u201d and that individuals should not hoard surplus wealth; and Cato\u2019s Letters, a series written by British \u201cradical Whigs\u201d in the 1720s who, angered by the infamous South Sea Bubble, called for reforms while bitterly criticizing the corrupting ties between wealth and politics. Advertisement By the mid-18th century, Anglo-Americans generally believed in the virtues of a \u201crough\u201d economic equality, that a republic needed to avoid concentrated wealth and great poverty in order to maintain the public good and prevent corruption. These ideals held particular power because they reflected the experiences of most British Americans. Widespread property ownership among white settlers meant that in every province a far higher percentage of white adult men could vote than in England. Even the wealthiest Southern planters needed the political support of their poorer\u2014yet still property-holding\u2014neighbors. Read More: How Insecurity Became the New Inequality The widespread embrace of these ideas can be glimpsed in the publication of Cato\u2019s Letters in the Boston Independent Advertiser in 1748. The very first selection included the warning that when a man\u2019s wealth \u201cbecome immeasurably or surprising great,\u201d the community \u201cought to make strict Enquiry, how they came by them, and oblige them\u201d to surrender part of their riches. \u201cBut, will some say, is it a Crime to be rich? Yes, certainly. At the publick expence, or to the Danger of the Publick.\u201d  The Advertiser was edited by Samuel Adams for artisans and laborers fired up by their successful resistance to impressment\u2014the Navy\u2019s effort to grab men for forced service\u2014and concerned about rising poverty in the postwar depression. Sixteen years later, Adams would organize those artisans and laborers into the Sons of Liberty to resist British imperial measures. Advertisement These egalitarian ideas became more apparent as the conflict with London deepened and moved towards revolution. In his 1773 election sermon, Benjamin Trumbull warned Connecticut\u2019s governor and legislators that if a few were allowed to \u201camass all the riches and wealth of a country\u201d they would \u201cby fraud or force . . . oppress and tyrannize over their fellow-men.\u201d To avoid that evil, the community needed to keep property \u201cas equally divided as possible.\u201d Three years later, such a measure nearly became part of Pennsylvania\u2019s first constitution when a delegate, probably Benjamin Franklin, proposed empowering the legislature to take \u201cexcessive\u201d property from individuals because concentrations of wealth were \u201ca danger to the happiness of mankind.\u201d As the War for Independence widened and inflation became a major problem, many states and towns sought to regulate prices, in part for egalitarian reasons. For example, in May 1777, committees of safety in Plymouth County began their resolution supporting Massachusetts price limits by insisting that \u201cthe felicity, freedom, and happiness of a community\u201d depends on \u201can equitable exchange of the fruits of the earth.\u201d Two years later, as inflation returned, a huge Philadelphia gathering denounced the wealthy and elected a committee to lower prices. When a merchant committee condemned those restraints, the committee insisted that civil society required \u201csubordination to the common good\u201d and argued that those who had built the merchants\u2019 ships were entitled to regulate goods carried on the vessels. Advertisement As the war ended, many white Americans believed that they lived in the most egalitarian country on earth, where most free men could vote due to, as Noah Webster wrote, the \u201cgeneral and tolerably equal distribution of landed property.\u201d But they also feared a future aristocracy of wealth, and thus considered measures to forestall that evil.  Some called for limits on landholding, including the biblical Great Jubilee that would prevent \u201cland monopoly\u201d by cancelling debts and returning land to the original owners. Thomas Jefferson and others talked about progressive property taxes. And Thomas Paine called for a 10% estate tax to fund old-age pensions and a payment to every person at 21.  These proposals failed but there was one noticeable change: by 1800, nearly every state abolished the traditional laws of entail (permanently blocking the division or alteration of property) and primogeniture (inheritance of the entire estate by the eldest son) in order to encourage the division of large estates. At least in Virginia, those reforms, spearheaded by Jefferson, did reduce the size of inherited farms. Advertisement Read More: The Rise of America\u2019s Broligarchy and What to Do About It Unfortunately, this focus on land overlooked the growing role of financial wealth: as trade and manufacturing flourished, power was increasingly measured in dollars rather than acres. When wage labor and economic inequality increased in the early 1800s, states extended the vote to all white men regardless of property. This severed the connection between property and polity, relieving pressure to limit wealth while making the racial barrier explicit.  But America\u2019s egalitarian tradition did not disappear. It would be revived by Workingmen\u2019s parties in the late 1820s, communitarian efforts in the 1840s, calls in the mid-1860s to redistribute Confederate plantations to freed Black men, and labor and farmer movements into the 20th century. More persistent has been the widespread fear that great wealth poses an existential threat to America\u2019s democracy. Perhaps the 250th commemoration of the Revolution would be the time to again consider limits on excessive wealth and its political influence.

The novel coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated income inequality, experts say, stretching the racial wealth gap in the United States and making the richest wealthier while leaving many of the poorest without jobs. As the COVID-19 pandemic overtook the U.S., it brought with it an unprecedented financial crisis and unemployment rates at their highest levels since the Great Depression, especially among Black, Hispanic and Asian workers (16.8%, 17.6% and 15% in May compared to 12.4% for whites). At least 45 million people have filed for unemployment since the pandemic began. Yet between March 18 and June 17, as the pandemic raged, the combined wealth of the 614 U.S. billionaires increased by $584 billion, according to an analysis released late last week by the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank based in Washington, D.C. The researchers calculated the billionaires' wealth gains based on real-time data from Forbes. Experts said the wealth of the richest Americans is tied more closely than the rest of America to the stock market, which crashed at the onset of the crisis but has rallied since -- largely detached from the broader economic picture. \"The pandemic crisis will widen the already worrisome levels of income, racial, and gender inequality in the U.S,\" Dimitri Papadimitriou, President of the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College, and former Greek Minister of Economy and Development, told ABC News. \"This engenders an element of a vicious circle at work: not only will the pandemic and its fallout worsen inequality; inequality will exacerbate the spread of the virus, not to mention undermine any ensuing economic recovery efforts.\" Data has shown that the virus has disproportionately affected Blacks and Latinos, who each have hospitalization rates 4.5 times that of non-Hispanic whites, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Communities of color are also overrepresented among essential workers who are generally unable to work from home and more likely to come into contact with the virus. \"Even though most people would assert that a disease or other disaster is blind to differences of race, creed or wealth, we are not \u2018all in this pandemic together,'\" Papadimitrou added. \"This assumption that 'we are together' distracts us from the socio-economic dimensions of the COVID-19 crisis.\" Chuck Collins, the co-author of the analysis and the director of the program on inequality at the Institute for Policy Studies told ABC News that their findings are \"a reflection of this extremely unequal time that we are living in and it's not that simple, it's really 40 years of accumulating, accelerating inequality.\" As the U.S. entered the pandemic, \"in some ways the extreme inequality was the preexisting condition,\" Collins said. The impact of income inequality during a pandemic isn\u2019t just linked to economic hardship -- it can also be deadly. A team of researchers from the London School of Economics U.S. Centre argued in a May analysis that \"states with greater income inequality are more likely to report more COVID-19 cases and fatalities.\" \"The effect of inequality is large -- it is tied with the Human Development Index as the second strongest predictor of Covid deaths in various states,\u201d Harold Clarke, a professor of economics at University of Texas at Dallas and Paul Whitely, a professor at the University of Essex, wrote in their findings. The researchers measured inequality using the Gini Index, an economic barometer that ranks income inequality from 0 (total inequality) to 1 (total equality) and found that it was a strong predictor of COVID-19 deaths. New York, which had one of the highest Gini Index numbers at .52 also had the highest number of fatalities in the nation by a margin. But excluding New York and New Jersey, the researchers found that inequality was still a strong predictor. \"The U.S. so far has had the most deaths of any country,\" Dr. Mary Bassett, the director of the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at the Harvard T.H. Chan School, told ABC News. \"In the U.S., these track along racial lines, and you'll hear the phrase racial capitalism now being raised by protesters that the kind of economy that the United States developed was not only a capitalist economy but one that was kick-started by its reliance on slave labor.\" \"We see that reflected in the present day,\u201d Bassett said. \"To be black or Latino or Native American in the United States is to have a much higher risk of being poor.\" A Brookings Institute analysis found that in 2016, the typical white family had a net worth 10 times that of a Black family ($171,000 compared to $17,150). \"People\u2019s income determines their everyday lives, which includes their ability to access health services -- that's always true, but COVID-19 broke down into stark relief,\" Bassett said. \"I would argue that a series of choices that have been made in the United States at the societal level meant that the U.S. was much more vulnerable to this pandemic.\" Papadimitriou added that \"a reduction in income inequality is one of the most important -- if not the single-most important -- structural changes that needs to be implemented so that the U.S. economy can return to a sustainable growth path in the medium run.\" A public policy brief written by several of Papadimitriou's colleagues at the Levy Economics Institute, concludes that \"had these issues been addressed already, the pandemic\u2019s impacts on the United States would have been less severe.\" Michael Graetz, a professor at Columbia University and the author of the book \"The Wolf at the Door: The Menace of Economic Insecurity and How to Fight It,\" said some of the richest have seen their wealth grow during the pandemic in part because of how divorced the stock market can be from the real economy. \"Some stocks, the tech stocks in particular, have done extremely well during the pandemic and of course lots of shares of Facebook and Amazon and others are owned by billionaires so of course their wealth has gone up because their stock has gone up in value,\" he said. \"The bottom half of the American public doesn\u2019t own stocks so they haven\u2019t shared in those gains.\" The bottom 40% of earners, he added, have been hurt most by unemployment during the pandemic. \"So you have a situation where they\u2019ve lost their wages and Congress has temporarily provided some extra unemployment benefits to some of those folks and then sent $1,200 dollar checks but for those people, the people at the bottom half of the income distribution, have been living a precarious life before the pandemic, Graetz said. Congress boosted unemployment benefits during the pandemic and opened relief up to freelancers and others generally not covered by unemployment insurance. But people had to wait weeks in some cases for benefits. Stimulus checks were also not issued on a sliding scale based on need (although married couples making over $198,000 were ineligible). Even before the pandemic, Graetz cited a 2018 Federal Reserve survey that found nearly 40% of American families said they couldn't cover an unexpected $400 expense. \"The pandemic has created emergencies that are much larger than $400,\" he said. Wealth inequality in the U.S. is intrinsically linked to the racial wealth gap, Valerie Wilson, the director of the program on race, ethnicity, and the economy at the Economic Policy Institute, told ABC News. \"If we\u2019re seeing growth wealth inequality in general then it almost goes without question to say that the racial wealth gap is widening as well because a lot of the underlying racial disparities throughout the economy in wages, employment, income,\u201d Wilson said. \"Part of getting to recovery has to do with addressing these holes that have been opened even more by the pandemic.\" Understanding the rampant inequalities that are being exacerbated during the crisis are crucial when policymakers look towards economic recovery efforts. \"The first thing is just how to make sure the current recovery programs and stimulus programs reduce the racial wealth divide, not make it worse,\" Collins told ABC News. One solution is the Democrat-backed HEROES Act, Collins said, which provides hazard pay to front-line workers among other relief as well as oversight of current funding. \"We\u2019re spending trillions of dollars, let's not make the same mistakes that we did after the great recession of 2009 where we put in place policies that worsened the racial wealth gap,\" he added. \"It requires a certain intentional commitment to racial equity as part of the recovery.\" Bassett noted that \"$2 trillion [in the CARES Act] was mobilized to save Wall Street and large corporations\" which proves \"the U.S. can mobilize that kind of level of resource to protect people.\" \"But that would take a great deal of political courage and votes that currently don't exist,\" she added. Collins said data collection amid the pandemic is crucial, as are audits of how stimulus and government relief funds are being used. Finally, Collins noted the ultra-rich need to be paying their fair share of taxes. \"One of the reasons why our economy is so ill prepared, our public health system and our ability to respond to the pandemic, is because the very rich have seen their share of taxes continue to go down over the last three four decades, so we have to restore some progressivity to the tax code,\" he said. Papadimitrou said that policies combatting the epidemic and financial crisis must \"be sensitive to inequalities and to avoid exacerbating biases that increase social, gender, and racial gaps.\" \"If we ignore the regressive impact or refrain from taking action to mitigate these unequal harms will not only be an affront to principles of fairness, it will prolong the pandemic and worsen its severity,\u201d he added. While people can feel powerless, Wilson noted there are many ways you can make your voice heard. \"Why I feel people still have a voice is because of the protests, those are connected to police brutality and violence against Black people,\" she said, but noted that many companies and even government agencies have responded to them. \"We\u2019re tired of this, we want this to change, I think the same kind of attitude can be applied to so many kinds of injustices in this country.\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "text": "November 1, 2019 13 min read Is Inequality Inevitable? Wealth naturally trickles up in free-market economies, model suggests By Bruce M. Boghosian  Hanna Barczyk Wealth inequality is escalating at an alarming rate not only within the U.S. but also in countries as diverse as Russia, India and Brazil. According to investment bank Credit Suisse, the fraction of global household wealth held by the richest 1 percent of the world's population increased from 42.5 to 47.2 percent between the financial crisis of 2008 and 2018. To put it another way, as of 2010, 388 individuals possessed as much household wealth as the lower half of the world's population combined\u2014about 3.5 billion people; today Oxfam estimates that number as 26. Statistics from almost all nations that measure wealth in their household surveys indicate that it is becoming increasingly concentrated. Although the origins of inequality are hotly debated, an approach developed by physicists and mathematicians, including my group at Tufts University, suggests they have long been hiding in plain sight\u2014in a well-known quirk of arithmetic. This method uses models of wealth distribution collectively known as agent-based, which begin with an individual transaction between two \u201cagents\u201d or actors, each trying to optimize his or her own financial outcome. In the modern world, nothing could seem more fair or natural than two people deciding to exchange goods, agreeing on a price and shaking hands. Indeed, the seeming stability of an economic system arising from this balance of supply and demand among individual actors is regarded as a pinnacle of Enlightenment thinking\u2014to the extent that many people have come to conflate the free market with the notion of freedom itself. Our deceptively simple mathematical models, which are based on voluntary transactions, suggest, however, that it is time for a serious reexamination of this idea. In particular, the affine wealth model (called thus because of its mathematical properties) can describe wealth distribution among households in diverse developed countries with exquisite precision while revealing a subtle asymmetry that tends to concentrate wealth. We believe that this purely analytical approach, which resembles an x-ray in that it is used not so much to represent the messiness of the real world as to strip it away and reveal the underlying skeleton, provides deep insight into the forces acting to increase poverty and inequality today.

In 1986 social scientist John Angle first described the movement and distribution of wealth as arising from pairwise transactions among a collection of \u201ceconomic agents,\u201d which could be individuals, households, companies, funds or other entities. By the turn of the century physicists Slava Ispolatov, Pavel L. Krapivsky and Sidney Redner, then all working together at Boston University, as well as Adrian Dr\u0103gulescu, now at Constellation Energy Group, and Victor Yakovenko of the University of Maryland, had demonstrated that these agent-based models could be analyzed with the tools of statistical physics, leading to rapid advances in our understanding of their behavior. As it turns out, many such models find wealth moving inexorably from one agent to another\u2014even if they are based on fair exchanges between equal actors. In 2002 Anirban Chakraborti, then at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kolkata, India, introduced what came to be known as the yard sale model, called thus because it has certain features of real one-on-one economic transactions. He also used numerical simulations to demonstrate that it inexorably concentrated wealth, resulting in oligarchy. Credit: Brown Bird Design To understand how this happens, suppose you are in a casino and are invited to play a game. You must place some ante\u2014say, $100\u2014on a table, and a fair coin will be flipped. If the coin comes up heads, the house will pay you 20 percent of what you have on the table, resulting in $120 on the table. If the coin comes up tails, the house will take 17 percent of what you have on the table, resulting in $83 left on the table. You can keep your money on the table for as many flips of the coin as you would like (without ever adding to or subtracting from it). Each time you play, you will win 20 percent of what is on the table if the coin comes up heads, and you will lose 17 percent of it if the coin comes up tails. Should you agree to play this game? You might construct two arguments, both rather persuasive, to help you decide what to do. You may think, \u201cI have a probability of \u00bd of gaining $20 and a probability of \u00bd of losing $17. My expected gain is therefore: \u00bd x ($20) +\u00a0\u00bd x (-$17) = $1.50 which is positive. In other words, my odds of winning and losing are even, but my gain if I win will be greater than my loss if I lose.\u201d From this perspective it seems advantageous to play this game. Or, like a chess player, you might think further: \u201cWhat if I stay for 10 flips of the coin? A likely outcome is that five of them will come up heads and that the other five will come up tails. Each time heads comes up, my ante is multiplied by 1.2. Each time tails comes up, my ante is multiplied by 0.83. After five wins and five losses in any order, the amount of money remaining on the table will be: 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x\u00a01.2 x\u00a01.2 x 0.83\u00a0x 0.83 x 0.83 x 0.83 x 0.83 x $100 = $98.02 so I will have lost about $2 of my original $100 ante.\u201d With a bit more work you can confirm that it would take about 93 wins to compensate for 91 losses. From this perspective it seems disadvantageous to play this game. The contradiction between the two arguments presented here may seem surprising at first, but it is well known in probability and finance. Its connection with wealth inequality is less familiar, however. To extend the casino metaphor to the movement of wealth in an (exceedingly simplified) economy, let us imagine a system of 1,000 individuals who engage in pairwise exchanges with one another. Let each begin with some initial wealth, which could be exactly equal. Choose two agents at random and have them transact, then do the same with another two, and so on. In other words, this model assumes sequential transactions between randomly chosen pairs of agents. Our plan is to conduct millions or billions of such transactions in our population of 1,000 and see how the wealth ultimately gets distributed. Credit:\u00a0Hanna Barczyk What should a single transaction between a pair of agents look like? People have a natural aversion to going broke, so we assume that the amount at stake, which we call \u0394\u03c9 (\u0394\u03c9 is pronounced \u201cdelta w\u201d), is a mere fraction of the wealth of the poorer person, Shauna. That way, even if Shauna loses in a transaction with Eric, the richer person, the amount she loses is always less than her own total wealth. This is not an unreasonable assumption and in fact captures a self-imposed limitation that most people instinctively observe in their economic life. To begin with\u2014just because these numbers are familiar to us\u2014let us suppose \u0394\u03c9 is 20 percent of Shauna's wealth, \u03c9, if she wins and \u201317 percent of \u03c9 if she loses. (Our actual model assumes that the win and loss percentages are equal, but the general outcome still holds. Moreover, increasing or decreasing \u0394\u03c9 will just extend the time scale so that more transactions will be required before we can see the ultimate result, which will remain unaltered.) If our goal is to model a fair and stable market economy, we ought to begin by assuming that nobody has an advantage of any kind, so let us decide the direction in which w is moved by the flip of a fair coin. If the coin comes up heads, Shauna gets 20 percent of her wealth from Eric; if the coin comes up tails, she must give 17 percent of it to Eric. Now randomly choose another pair of agents from the total of 1,000 and do it again. In fact, go ahead and do this a million times or a billion times. What happens? If you simulate this economy, a variant of the yard sale model, you will get a remarkable result: after a large number of transactions, one agent ends up as an \u201coligarch\u201d holding practically all the wealth of the economy, and the other 999 end up with virtually nothing. It does not matter how much wealth people started with. It does not matter that all the coin flips were absolutely fair. It does not matter that the poorer agent's expected outcome was positive in each transaction, whereas that of the richer agent was negative. Any single agent in this economy could have become the oligarch\u2014in fact, all had equal odds if they began with equal wealth. In that sense, there was equality of opportunity. But only one of them did become the oligarch, and all the others saw their average wealth decrease toward zero as they conducted more and more transactions. To add insult to injury, the lower someone's wealth ranking, the faster the decrease. This outcome is especially surprising because it holds even if all the agents started off with identical wealth and were treated symmetrically. Physicists describe phenomena of this kind as \u201csymmetry breaking\u201d [see The Physics of Inequality below]. The very first coin flip transfers money from one agent to another, setting up an imbalance between the two. And once we have some variance in wealth, however minute, succeeding transactions will systematically move a \u201ctrickle\u201d of wealth upward from poorer agents to richer ones, amplifying inequality until the system reaches a state of oligarchy. If the economy is unequal to begin with, the poorest agent's wealth will probably decrease the fastest. Where does it go? It must go to wealthier agents because there are no poorer agents. Things are not much better for the second-poorest agent. In the long run, all participants in this economy except for the very richest one will see their wealth decay exponentially. In separate papers in 2015 my colleagues and I at Tufts University and Christophe Chorro of Universit\u00e9 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne provided mathematical proofs of the outcome that Chakraborti's simulations had uncovered\u2014that the yard sale model moves wealth inexorably from one side to the other. Does this mean that poorer agents never win or that richer agents never lose? Certainly not. Once again, the setup resembles a casino\u2014you win some and you lose some, but the longer you stay in the casino, the more likely you are to lose. The free market is essentially a casino that you can never leave. When the trickle of wealth described earlier, flowing from poor to rich in each transaction, is multiplied by 7.7 billion people in the world conducting countless transactions every year, the trickle becomes a torrent. Inequality inevitably grows more pronounced because of the collective effects of enormous numbers of seemingly innocuous but subtly biased transactions. You might, of course, wonder how this model, even if mathematically accurate, has anything to do with reality. After all, it describes an entirely unstable economy that inevitably degenerates to complete oligarchy, and there are no complete oligarchies in the world. It is true that, by itself, the yard sale model is unable to explain empirical wealth distributions. To address this deficiency, my group has refined it in three ways to make it more realistic. In 2017 Adrian Devitt-Lee, Merek Johnson, Jie Li, Jeremy Marcq, Hongyan Wang and I, all at Tufts, incorporated the redistribution of wealth. In keeping with the simplicity desirable in applied mathematics models, we did this by having each agent take a step toward the mean wealth in the society after each transaction. The size of the step was some fraction \u03c7 (or \u201cchi\u201d) of his or her distance from the mean. This is equivalent to a flat wealth tax for the wealthy (with tax rate \u03c7 per unit time) and a complementary subsidy for the poor. In effect, it transfers wealth from those above the mean to those below it. We found that this simple modification stabilized the wealth distribution so that oligarchy no longer resulted. And astonishingly, it enabled our model to match empirical data on U.S. and European wealth distribution between 1989 and 2016 to better than 2 percent. The single parameter \u03c7 seems to subsume a host of real-world taxes and subsidies that would be too messy to include separately in a skeletal model such as this one.

As James Baldwin once observed, \u201cAnyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor.\u201d Accordingly, in the same paper mentioned above, we factored in what we call wealth-attained advantage. We biased the coin flip in favor of the wealthier individual by an amount proportional to a new parameter, \u03b6 (or \u201czeta\u201d), times the wealth difference divided by the mean wealth. This rather simple refinement, which serves as a proxy for a multitude of biases favoring the wealthy, improved agreement between the model and the upper tail of actual wealth distributions. The inclusion of wealth-related bias also yields\u2014and gives a precise mathematical definition to\u2014the phenomenon of partial oligarchy. Whenever the influence of wealth-attained advantage exceeds that of redistribution (more precisely, whenever \u03b6 exceeds \u03c7), a vanishingly small fraction of people will possess a finite fraction, 1 \u2212 \u03c7/\u03b6, of societal wealth. The onset of partial oligarchy is in fact a phase transition for another model of economic transactions, as first described in 2000 by physicists Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, now at \u00c9cole Polytechnique, and Marc M\u00e9zard of the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. In our model, when \u03b6 is less than \u03c7, the system has only one stable state with no oligarchy; when \u03b6 exceeds \u03c7, a new, oligarchical state appears and becomes the stable state [see graphic above]. The two-parameter (\u03c7 and \u03b6) extended yard sale model thus obtained can match empirical data on U.S. and European wealth distribution between 1989 and 2016 to within 1 to 2 percent. Such a phase transition may have played a crucial role in the condensation of wealth following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The imposition of what was called shock therapy economics on the former states of the U.S.S.R. resulted in a dramatic decrease of wealth redistribution (that is, decreasing \u03c7) by their governments and a concomitant jump in wealth-attained advantage (increasing \u03b6) from the combined effects of sudden privatization and deregulation. The resulting decrease of the \u201ctemperature\u201d \u03c7/\u03b6 threw the countries into a wealth-condensed state, so that formerly communist countries became partial oligarchies almost overnight. To the present day at least 10 of the 15 former Soviet republics can be accurately described as oligarchies. As a third refinement, in 2019 we included negative wealth\u2014one of the more disturbing aspects of modern economies\u2014in our model. In 2016, for example, approximately 10.5 percent of the U.S. population was in net debt because of mortgages, student loans and other factors. So we introduced a third parameter, \u03ba (or \u201ckappa\u201d), which shifts the wealth distribution downward, thereby accounting for negative wealth. We supposed that the least wealth the poorest agent could have at any time was \u2013S, where S equals \u03ba times the mean wealth. Prior to each transaction, we loaned wealth S to both agents so that each had positive wealth. They then transacted according to the extended yard sale model, described earlier, after which they both repaid their debt of S. The three-parameter (\u03c7, \u03b6, \u03ba) model thus obtained, called the affine wealth model, can match empirical data on U.S. wealth distribution to less than a sixth of a percent over a span of three decades. (In mathematics, the word \u201caffine\u201d describes something that scales multiplicatively and translates additively. In this case, some features of the model, such as the value of \u0394\u03c9, scale multiplicatively with the wealth of the agent, whereas other features, such as the addition or subtraction of S, are additive translations or displacements in \u201cwealth space.\u201d) Agreement with European wealth-distribution data for 2010 is typically better than a third to a half of a percent [see box below]. To obtain these comparisons with actual data, we had to solve the \u201cinverse problem.\u201d That is, given the empirical wealth distribution, we had to find the values of (\u03c7, \u03b6, \u03ba) at which the results of our model most closely matched it. As just one example, the 2016 U.S. household wealth distribution is best described as having \u03c7 = 0.036, \u03b6 = 0.050 and \u03ba = 0.058. The affine wealth model has been applied to empirical data from many countries and epochs. To the best of our knowledge, it describes wealth-distribution data more accurately than any other existing model. Credit: Jen Christiansen; Source: Bruce M. Boghosian; European Central Bank (country data) We find it noteworthy that the best-fitting model for empirical wealth distribution discovered so far is one that would be completely unstable without redistribution rather than one based on a supposed equilibrium of market forces. In fact, these mathematical models demonstrate that far from wealth trickling down to the poor, the natural inclination of wealth is to flow upward, so that the \u201cnatural\u201d wealth distribution in a free-market economy is one of complete oligarchy. It is only redistribution that sets limits on inequality. The mathematical models also call attention to the enormous extent to which wealth distribution is caused by symmetry breaking, chance and early advantage (from, for example, inheritance). And the presence of symmetry breaking puts paid to arguments for the justness of wealth inequality that appeal to \u201cvoluntariness\u201d\u2014the notion that individuals bear all responsibility for their economic outcomes simply because they enter into transactions voluntarily\u2014or to the idea that wealth accumulation must be the result of cleverness and industriousness. It is true that an individual's location on the wealth spectrum correlates to some extent with such attributes, but the overall shape of that spectrum can be explained to better than 0.33 percent by a statistical model that completely ignores them. Luck plays a much more important role than it is usually accorded, so that the virtue commonly attributed to wealth in modern society\u2014and, likewise, the stigma attributed to poverty\u2014is completely unjustified. Moreover, only a carefully designed mechanism for redistribution can compensate for the natural tendency of wealth to flow from the poor to the rich in a market economy. Redistribution is often confused with taxes, but the two concepts ought to be kept quite separate. Taxes flow from people to their governments to finance those governments' activities. Redistribution, in contrast, may be implemented by governments, but it is best thought of as a flow of wealth from people to people to compensate for the unfairness inherent in market economics. In a flat redistribution scheme, all those possessing wealth below the mean would receive net funds, whereas those above the mean would pay. And precisely because current levels of inequality are so extreme, far more people would receive than would pay. Given how complicated real economies are, we find it gratifying that a simple analytical approach developed by physicists and mathematicians describes the actual wealth distributions of multiple nations with unprecedented precision and accuracy. Also rather curious is that these distributions display subtle but key features of complex physical systems. Most important, however, the fact that a sketch of the free market as simple and plausible as the affine wealth model gives rise to economies that are anything but free and fair should be both a cause for alarm and a call for action.

According to investment bank Credit Suisse, the fraction of global household wealth held by the richest 1 percent of the world's population increased from 42.5 to 47.2 percent between the financial crisis of 2008 and 2018. To put it another way, as of 2010, 388 individuals possessed as much household wealth as the lower half of the world's population combined\u2014about 3.5 billion people; today Oxfam estimates that number as 26. Statistics from almost all nations that measure wealth in their household surveys indicate that it is becoming increasingly concentrated.\n\nAlthough the origins of inequality are hotly debated, an approach developed by physicists and mathematicians, including my group at Tufts University, suggests they have long been hiding in plain sight\u2014in a well-known quirk of arithmetic. This method uses models of wealth distribution collectively known as agent-based, which begin with an individual transaction between two \u201cagents\u201d or actors, each trying to optimize his or her own financial outcome.\n\nIn the modern world, nothing could seem more fair or natural than two people deciding to exchange goods, agreeing on a price and shaking hands. Indeed, the seeming stability of an economic system arising from this balance of supply and demand among individual actors is regarded as a pinnacle of Enlightenment thinking\u2014to the extent that many people have come to conflate the free market with the notion of freedom itself.\n\nOur deceptively simple mathematical models, which are based on voluntary transactions, suggest, however, that it is time for a serious reexamination of this idea. In particular, the affine wealth model (called thus because of its mathematical properties) can describe wealth distribution among households in diverse developed countries with exquisite precision while revealing a subtle asymmetry that tends to concentrate wealth.\n\nWe believe that this purely analytical approach, which resembles an x-ray in that it is used not so much to represent the messiness of the real world as to strip it away and reveal the underlying skeleton, provides deep insight into the forces acting to increase poverty and inequality today.\n\nIn 1986 social scientist John Angle first described the movement and distribution of wealth as arising from pairwise transactions among a collection of \u201ceconomic agents,\u201d which could be individuals, households, companies, funds or other entities. By the turn of the century physicists Slava Ispolatov, Pavel L. Krapivsky and Sidney Redner, then all working together at Boston University, as well as Adrian Dr\u0103gulescu, now at Constellation Energy Group, and Victor Yakovenko of the University of Maryland, had demonstrated that these agent-based models could be analyzed with the tools of statistical physics, leading to rapid advances in our understanding of their behavior.\n\nAs it turns out, many such models find wealth moving inexorably from one agent to another\u2014even if they are based on fair exchanges between equal actors. In 2002 Anirban Chakraborti, then at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kolkata, India, introduced what came to be known as the yard sale model, called thus because it has certain features of real one-on-one economic transactions. He also used numerical simulations to demonstrate that it inexorably concentrated wealth, resulting in oligarchy.\n\nTo understand how this happens, suppose you are in a casino and are invited to play a game. You must place some ante\u2014say, $100\u2014on a table, and a fair coin will be flipped. If the coin comes up heads, the house will pay you 20 percent of what you have on the table, resulting in $120 on the table. If the coin comes up tails, the house will take 17 percent of what you have on the table, resulting in $83 left on the table. You can keep your money on the table for as many flips of the coin as you would like (without ever adding to or subtracting from it). Each time you play, you will win 20 percent of what is on the table if the coin comes up heads, and you will lose 17 percent of it if the coin comes up tails.\n\nShould you agree to play this game? You might construct two arguments, both rather persuasive, to help you decide what to do. You may think, \u201cI have a probability of \u00bd of gaining $20 and a probability of \u00bd of losing $17. My expected gain is therefore: \u00bd x ($20) + \u00bd x (-$17) = $1.50 which is positive. In other words, my odds of winning and losing are even, but my gain if I win will be greater than my loss if I lose.\u201d From this perspective it seems advantageous to play this game.\n\nOr, like a chess player, you might think further: \u201cWhat if I stay for 10 flips of the coin? A likely outcome is that five of them will come up heads and that the other five will come up tails. Each time heads comes up, my ante is multiplied by 1.2. Each time tails comes up, my ante is multiplied by 0.83. After five wins and five losses in any order, the amount of money remaining on the table will be: 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.83 x 0.83 x 0.83 x 0.83 x 0.83 x $100 = $98.02 so I will have lost about $2 of my original $100 ante.\u201d With a bit more work you can confirm that it would take about 93 wins to compensate for 91 losses. From this perspective it seems disadvantageous to play this game.\n\nThe contradiction between the two arguments presented here may seem surprising at first, but it is well known in probability and finance. Its connection with wealth inequality is less familiar, however.\n\nTo extend the casino metaphor to the movement of wealth in an (exceedingly simplified) economy, let us imagine a system of 1,000 individuals who engage in pairwise exchanges with one another. Let each begin with some initial wealth, which could be exactly equal. Choose two agents at random and have them transact, then do the same with another two, and so on. In other words, this model assumes sequential transactions between randomly chosen pairs of agents.\n\nOur plan is to conduct millions or billions of such transactions in our population of 1,000 and see how the wealth ultimately gets distributed.\n\nWhat should a single transaction between a pair of agents look like? People have a natural aversion to going broke, so we assume that the amount at stake, which we call \u0394\u03c9 (\u0394\u03c9 is pronounced \u201cdelta w\u201d), is a mere fraction of the wealth of the poorer person, Shauna. That way, even if Shauna loses in a transaction with Eric, the richer person, the amount she loses is always less than her own total wealth.\n\nThis is not an unreasonable assumption and in fact captures a self-imposed limitation that most people instinctively observe in their economic life. To begin with\u2014just because these numbers are familiar to us\u2014let us suppose \u0394\u03c9 is 20 percent of Shauna's wealth, \u03c9, if she wins and \u201317 percent of \u03c9 if she loses.\n\nIf our goal is to model a fair and stable market economy, we ought to begin by assuming that nobody has an advantage of any kind, so let us decide the direction in which w is moved by the flip of a fair coin. If the coin comes up heads, Shauna gets 20 percent of her wealth from Eric; if the coin comes up tails, she must give 17 percent of it to Eric.\n\nNow randomly choose another pair of agents from the total of 1,000 and do it again. In fact, go ahead and do this a million times or a billion times. What happens?\n\nIf you simulate this economy, a variant of the yard sale model, you will get a remarkable result: after a large number of transactions, one agent ends up as an \u201coligarch\u201d holding practically all the wealth of the economy, and the other 999 end up with virtually nothing.\n\nIt does not matter how much wealth people started with. It does not matter that all the coin flips were absolutely fair. It does not matter that the poorer agent's expected outcome was positive in each transaction, whereas that of the richer agent was negative. Any single agent in this economy could have become the oligarch\u2014in fact, all had equal odds if they began with equal wealth.\n\nIn that sense, there was equality of opportunity. But only one of them did become the oligarch, and all the others saw their average wealth decrease toward zero as they conducted more and more transactions. To add insult to injury, the lower someone's wealth ranking, the faster the decrease.\n\nThis outcome is especially surprising because it holds even if all the agents started off with identical wealth and were treated symmetrically. Physicists describe phenomena of this kind as \u201csymmetry breaking\u201d [see The Physics of Inequality below]. The very first coin flip transfers money from one agent to another, setting up an imbalance between the two.\n\nAnd once we have some variance in wealth, however minute, succeeding transactions will systematically move a \u201ctrickle\u201d of wealth upward from poorer agents to richer ones, amplifying inequality until the system reaches a state of oligarchy.\n\nIf the economy is unequal to begin with, the poorest agent's wealth will probably decrease the fastest. Where does it go? It must go to wealthier agents because there are no poorer agents.\n\nThings are not much better for the second-poorest agent. In the long run, all participants in this economy except for the very richest one will see their wealth decay exponentially.\n\nIn separate papers in 2015 my colleagues and I at Tufts University and Christophe Chorro of Universit\u00e9 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne provided mathematical proofs of the outcome that Chakraborti's simulations had uncovered\u2014that the yard sale model moves wealth inexorably from one side to the other.\n\nDoes this mean that poorer agents never win or that richer agents never lose? Certainly not. Once again, the setup resembles a casino\u2014you win some and you lose some, but the longer you stay in the casino, the more likely you are to lose.\n\nThe free market is essentially a casino that you can never leave. When the trickle of wealth described earlier, flowing from poor to rich in each transaction, is multiplied by 7.7 billion people in the world conducting countless transactions every year, the trickle becomes a torrent.\n\nInequality inevitably grows more pronounced because of the collective effects of enormous numbers of seemingly innocuous but subtly biased transactions.\n\nYou might, of course, wonder how this model, even if mathematically accurate, has anything to do with reality. After all, it describes an entirely unstable economy that inevitably degenerates to complete oligarchy, and there are no complete oligarchies in the world.\n\nIt is true that, by itself, the yard sale model is unable to explain empirical wealth distributions. To address this deficiency, my group has refined it in three ways to make it more realistic.\n\nIn 2017 Adrian Devitt-Lee, Merek Johnson, Jie Li, Jeremy Marcq, Hongyan Wang and I, all at Tufts, incorporated the redistribution of wealth. In keeping with the simplicity desirable in applied mathematics models, we did this by having each agent take a step toward the mean wealth in the society after each transaction.\n\nThe size of the step was some fraction \u03c7 (or \u201cchi\u201d) of his or her distance from the mean. This is equivalent to a flat wealth tax for the wealthy (with tax rate \u03c7 per unit time) and a complementary subsidy for the poor.\n\nIn effect, it transfers wealth from those above the mean to those below it. We found that this simple modification stabilized the wealth distribution so that oligarchy no longer resulted.\n\nAnd astonishingly, it enabled our model to match empirical data on U.S. and European wealth distribution between 1989 and 2016 to better than 2 percent.\n\nThe single parameter \u03c7 seems to subsume a host of real-world taxes and subsidies that would be too messy to include separately in a skeletal model such as this one.\n\nIn addition, it is well documented that the wealthy enjoy systemic economic advantages such as lower interest rates on loans and better financial advice, whereas the poor suffer systemic economic disadvantages such as payday lenders and a lack of time to shop for the best prices.\n\nAs James Baldwin once observed, \u201cAnyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, in the same paper mentioned above, we factored in what we call wealth-attained advantage. We biased the coin flip in favor of the wealthier individual by an amount proportional to a new parameter, \u03b6 (or \u201czeta\u201d), times the wealth difference divided by the mean wealth.\n\nThis rather simple refinement, which serves as a proxy for a multitude of biases favoring the wealthy, improved agreement between the model and the upper tail of actual wealth distributions.\n\nThe inclusion of wealth-related bias also yields\u2014and gives a precise mathematical definition to\u2014the phenomenon of partial oligarchy.\n\nWhenever the influence of wealth-attained advantage exceeds that of redistribution (more precisely, whenever \u03b6 exceeds \u03c7), a vanishingly small fraction of people will possess a finite fraction, 1 \u2212 \u03c7/\u03b6, of societal wealth.\n\nThe onset of partial oligarchy is in fact a phase transition for another model of economic transactions, as first described in 2000 by physicists Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, now at \u00c9cole Polytechnique, and Marc M\u00e9zard of the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure.\n\nIn our model, when \u03b6 is less than \u03c7, the system has only one stable state with no oligarchy; when \u03b6 exceeds \u03c7, a new, oligarchical state appears and becomes the stable state [see graphic above].\n\nThe two-parameter (\u03c7 and \u03b6) extended yard sale model thus obtained can match empirical data on U.S. and European wealth distribution between 1989 and 2016 to within 1 to 2 percent.\n\nSuch a phase transition may have played a crucial role in the condensation of wealth following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nThe imposition of what was called shock therapy economics on the former states of the U.S.S.R. resulted in a dramatic decrease of wealth redistribution (that is, decreasing \u03c7) by their governments and a concomitant jump in wealth-attained advantage (increasing \u03b6) from the combined effects of sudden privatization and deregulation.\n\nThe resulting decrease of the \u201ctemperature\u201d \u03c7/\u03b6 threw the countries into a wealth-condensed state, so that formerly communist countries became partial oligarchies almost overnight.\n\nTo the present day at least 10 of the 15 former Soviet republics can be accurately described as oligarchies.\n\nAs a third refinement, in 2019 we included negative wealth\u2014one of the more disturbing

    "text": "According to New York Times columnist David Brooks, socioeconomic segregation is ruining America. \u201cHousing and construction rules that keep the poor and less educated away from places with good schools and good job opportunities\u2026have a devastating effect on economic growth nationwide,\u201d Brooks wrote in a much-derided July 11 column. (Derided not for the sentiment outlined above so much as the evidence, which involved Italian cold cuts as a restrictive cultural signifier for the American upper middle class.) Salami aside, Brooks has a point. There\u2019s an widening gulf in the United States between the haves and the have-nots. The columnist points to education and metropolitan zoning restrictions as reinforcement for this unequal system, with statistics to support the argument. But how true is it? We asked urbanist, author, and University of Toronto professor Richard Florida to weigh in. (Florida is best-known for his concept of the \u201ccreative class.\u201d) Here\u2019s what he said, edited and condensed for clarity. When did this wealth gap problem start?\nBasically, this wealth gap that we see today is something that has really skyrocketed since about the 1980s and certainly in the past decade, decade and a half. How bad is the wealth inequality we\u2019re seeing in the United States?\nThe income inequality in the United States, according to the Gini coefficient (a measure of inequality where 0 is perfectly equal and 1 is perfectly unequal) is about 0.45, which is awful\u2014worse than Iran. How about in cities specifically?\nIn cities that inequality is even greater. There\u2019s a table in my book (The New Urban Crisis, Basic Books, $28) showing this. Inequality in New York City is like Swaziland. Miami\u2019s is like Zimbabwe. Los Angeles is equivalent to Sri Lanka. I actually look at the difference between the 95th percentile of income earners in big cities and the lower 20%. In the New York metro area, the 95th percentile makes $282,000 and the 20th percentile makes $23,000. These gaps between the rich and the poor in income and wealth are vast across the country and even worse in our cities. What is this idea of a \u201cknowledge-based economy\u201d?\nFirst introduced in the 1950s and 1960s by Fritz Malchup and Peter Drucker, the idea is that the economy is powered by knowledge, ideas and talent as opposed to resources and industry. Shouldn\u2019t having access to the same schools and being in close proximity to different socioeconomic classes make it easier to move out of your financial situation?\nThe research of other economists do show that in terms of upward mobility, living in cities like New York or San Francisco or Boston tends to be better for upward mobility than living in sprawling, more suburban areas. That said, what makes it harder \u2014and this is the core theme of The New Urban Crisis\u2014is that middle class neighborhoods are disappearing. In the past, most Americans lived in middle class neighborhoods, whether that was in the city or the suburbs. In the 1970s about 70% Americans lived in middle class neighborhoods. Now less than 40% of us do. And guess where middle class neighborhoods declined the most? In our largest, the most densest, knowledge-based metropolitan areas. Why have these middle class neighborhoods disappeared?\nNot only has income inequality and wealth inequality grown, the segregation of people not necessarily by race or by ethnicity\u2014that\u2019s a separate question\u2014but by socioeconomic class has grown. The wealthy have moved to much more concentrated areas of wealth. And those areas are surrounded by areas with much more concentrated disadvantage. The wealthy and the well educated and the more affluent have walled themselves off in separate neighborhoods. The growth in economic segregation really occurred in the last decade. In our biggest cities we see the biggest loss of the middle class. We see the biggest gaps not only between wealth in general, but where rich people and more educated knowledge workers live and where less advantaged people live. Is the economic segregation perpetuated by zoning laws or individuals?\nI think it\u2019s both. In the past, exclusionary zoning in the suburbs really functioned to keep poor people, less affluent people out. Today, I think the key factor is simply that wealthy, affluent people wanted to move back to cities. That\u2019s what happens not only when wealthy people but creative people, affluent people, interesting people live in cities\u2014they become more productive and more innovative. Cities become more attractive to high tech firms, innovative companies and creative organizations. So you have more competition for limited space. When you have more competition for limited space, the land value goes up. Then increasingly, you\u2019ve got to be rich to afford space in a city. I think the zoning laws have contributed to it, but one thing I found interesting was that the biggest inequality, segregation and housing unaffordability occurred in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco\u2014but Houston, a place that mostly doesn\u2019t have zoning laws and building restrictions, is high on the list as well. David Brooks wrote a column for The New York Times a few weeks ago touching on the culture of urbanites and how that relates to the wealth gap and segregated neighborhoods. Are Brooks\u2019 assertions about how the elites have created cultural barriers to socioeconomic mobility valid?\nI think it is a mistake to blame people who work hard, put work into selecting their partners and making sure their marriages work, and invest in their kids. Isn\u2019t that what the American Dream is supposed to be about? I think the barriers are much more formal and institutional than informal. Is the geographic divide of the American people based on socioeconomic status a result of the wealth gap or is it an underlying cause perpetuating the widening wealth gap?\nThey reinforce one another. Doesn\u2019t the clustering of innovation in a select few cities and states put places that depend less on knowledge-based economies at a disadvantage?\nWell those states are going to get left behind and they\u2019re going to grow angrier and angrier. This is what I like to call the political contradiction of American capitalism, where the things we need to grow in our economy, increasingly larger portions of the country don\u2019t want to invest in. How has the wealth gap affected the American people?\nThis gap between the rich and poor, the haves and the have-nots, is what produced the backlash that brought Donald Trump to power. Our country isn\u2019t just divided by politics or class, it\u2019s divided by where you live. The advantaged urban parts of the country by the coast\u2014New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles\u2014they\u2019re the blue areas, but the rest of America is increasingly red. The wealth gap that\u2019s occurring in places is behind the political backlash we\u2019re seeing in our country. Can we reverse this divide that\u2019s happening between large cities and rural areas?\nI think this, what I call spatial geographic inequality, is a deep fundamental characteristic of knowledge-based economies because what drives economic growth is a clustering of diverse, talented people in small areas. That\u2019s where the basic force of economic growth comes from, so the more we cluster in New York or San Francisco or wherever, the more we drive economic growth. The more innovation we create, the more we compete for space and those housing values. The finance industry, the media industry, the music industry all cluster in certain places. I think it\u2019s going to be very hard to counter this geographic inequality. How do we fix this?\nWe\u2019re going to have to recognize that as Americans, we live in different places. Some want to live in dense, knowledge-based areas. Others will want to live in more suburban or rural parts of the country and pay less in taxes and spend less on schools. Across the country, people are going to want different things. We\u2019re going to have to move from a highly centralized federal system to a system where our cities, suburbs and metropolitan areas can use their tax dollars to build the kinds of communities they want. By localizing governments, you can allow places to make the most of what they have. That way, we can begin to heal the divide in our country. Any last words?\nI think this inequality, not just between classes and wealth, but between locations is going to be the big issue of our time. \u00a9 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

    "text": "Published Aug 25, 2025 at 06:00 AM EDT CEO of the FCB Radio Network  Donald Trump claims Washington, D.C., needs the National Guard to get crime under control. Every time he says it, the same argument flares up: who's to blame for crime in America's cities? Progressive commentator Ed Krassenstein argued online that crime is really a red state problem, pointing to higher murder rates in Republican states. Conservative commentator Carmine Sabia, a friend of mine, shot back that Democratic mayors are responsible since they run most of the big cities. They're both wrong. And this is exactly the problem with the way we talk about crime in America. Everyone wants to use it as a political football. The truth is much simpler, and much harder: crime doesn't follow party lines. It follows poverty. The federal government's own numbers prove it. In 2023, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that people in households making under $25,000 a year were almost three times more likely to be victims of violent crime than those in households making more than $200,000. That's not red states versus blue states. That's poor versus rich. The same pattern shows up when you look at neighborhoods. The National Neighborhood Crime Study found that violent crime rises as poverty rises, regardless of whether the neighborhood is white, Black, Latino, or mixed. Once poverty is factored in, the racial gap in crime shrinks dramatically. In plain English, a poor white neighborhood and a poor Black neighborhood have more in common with each other than either does with a wealthy neighborhood. Columbus, Ohio, proved this point. Researchers found that when neighborhood poverty climbed above 40 percent, violent crime spiked. It didn't matter whether the residents were Black or white. Poverty was the trigger. Cleveland shows how those conditions were created and sustained. A 2018 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland found that neighborhoods redlined in the 1930s are still the poorest, most crime-affected parts of the city today. Eight decades later, the legacy of disinvestment is still visible. And this isn't just about cities. Rural America tells the same story. Stilwell, Oklahoma, a small Republican-majority town, has a violent crime rate about double the national average. Nearly half its children live below the poverty line. The problem isn't who the mayor is. The problem is entrenched poverty. That's why the partisan finger-pointing rings hollow. Yes, some red states have higher statewide murder rates. Yes, Democratic-run cities record more murders in raw numbers. Both statements are true. Neither one explains the real issue. Now, crime policy isn't irrelevant. It matters. Progressive Democrats can be too lax when it comes to fighting crime, and that has to be addressed. You can't ignore the symptoms. But if you're only focused on policing tactics and never address poverty, you're treating the fever without curing the disease. We have to deal with both the symptom and the cause. And it's worth remembering that not every big-city Democrat even fits the caricature partisans like to paint. Many mayors and city council members are moderates who spend as much time fighting progressives as they do fighting Republicans. Yet in the national debate, they get lumped in with those progressives as if they all share the same ideology. They don't. What would actually move the needle is cooperation. Red state governors and blue city mayors should be working together to address poverty instead of using crime as a talking point. That kind of partnership\u2014not endless partisan bickering\u2014actually helps people. If we want safer streets, the only way forward is tackling poverty head-on: schools that work, jobs that pay, communities that are invested in instead of ignored. Because until we do that, crime will remain highest where poverty is deepest. And politicians will keep using it as a football instead of fixing it.

While the bill would be a boon to wealthy Americans, it would scale back resources for the nation's poorest households, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warned in a recent letter to lawmakers. In an effort to pay for an extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, Republicans in both the House and Senate want to change or reduce key social safety net programs that provide health care, food benefits and financial assistance for millions of children. Here's what to know. More than 37 million children are enrolled in either Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a federal program that provides affordable health insurance to pregnant mothers and children who live just above Medicaid's poverty threshold. Combined, Medicaid and CHIP protect nearly half of all children in the United States, beginning with important prenatal care, covering over 40% of U.S. births as well as nearly half of all rural births, and continuing to insure millions of vulnerable children into young adulthood. Congressional Republicans want to continue to allow states to impose waiting periods before families can enroll in CHIP and to lock them out of the program if they fail to keep up with premiums. They also propose changing Medicaid to include a first-ever national work requirement. As the House bill is written, it would exempt parents, \"but what we've seen from past experience with work requirements is that exemptions are not always effective,\" says Allison Orris, director of Medicaid policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Senate Republicans propose going even further, with a part-time work requirement including parents of children over 14. \"If [parents'] earnings go up because they're complying, that actually could be good for the kids,\" says Kevin Corinth, who studies poverty and safety net programs at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute (AEI). \"Because there is good research showing that, when parents work and we get more earnings coming into the household, that can improve current and future outcomes [for children].\" In addition to work requirements, Republicans are proposing other changes that would create new administrative hurdles for families, according to Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families. \"When there's more red tape, we know that it's harder for families,\" says Joan Alker, head of the center and a Georgetown research professor. \"To see these kinds of cuts is very, very scary.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson's office defended the changes in a press release, writing that \"Republicans are protecting and strengthening Medicaid for American citizens who need and deserve it by rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.\" He also claimed on NBC's Meet the Press, \"there are no Medicaid cuts in the Big, Beautiful Bill. We're not cutting Medicaid.\" Yet CBO estimates the House bill would cut federal spending on Medicaid by roughly $800 billion over the next decade, and the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation focused on improving health care access, estimates 1 in 5 children could be at risk of losing their Medicaid coverage if the House proposal goes into place. Alker says the House changes would force states to make difficult decisions about whether to cut services or raise taxes. \"Governors are gonna have to do the dirty work,\" she says. And the Senate's proposal, she warns, would be even harder on states. According to research by CBO, consistent Medicaid coverage in childhood increases earnings in adulthood, which increases tax revenue and can gradually repay the federal government for its early investment. In fact, CBO found, \"increasing children's enrollment in Medicaid would reduce the future federal deficit by between roughly $800 and $3,400 per child per year of enrollment.\" House Republicans have also proposed big changes to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, which, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, helps pay for groceries for more than 15 million children in the U.S. This bill would bring \"the deepest cut to food assistance in history,\" says Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for food assistance at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The House bill would expand SNAP's existing work requirements, though Bergh says \"research has repeatedly shown that this doesn't increase people's employment. It doesn't increase their earnings. It just cuts people off of SNAP and leaves them hungry.\" The House bill would also cut more than $290 billion from SNAP over 10 years \u2013 a cut Bergh estimates would \"eliminate or substantially reduce\" food assistance for more than 2 million children. And the House proposal could, for the first time in the history of SNAP, put states on the hook for between 5% and 25% of the cost of food benefits. Whether this shift in funding, from the federal government onto states, is a good idea is \"debatable,\" says AEI's Corinth, though he points to one potential upside: It could force states to have \"more skin in the game.\" One potential downside, according to CBO, is that some states \"would modify benefits or eligibility or possibly leave [SNAP] altogether because of the increased costs.\" And for children, losing access to SNAP benefits could hurt them in more ways than one, as they would also lose their automatic enrollment in free meals at school. In its analysis of the overall impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill, CBO estimates resources for the poorest households \"would decrease by about $1,600 per year,\" a loss \"mainly attributable\" to cuts in the social safety net, including Medicaid and SNAP. By contrast, CBO predicts the wealthiest households would see an average annual gain of $12,000. House Republicans hotly dispute CBO's math, with Speaker Mike Johnson claiming \"the biggest beneficiaries of this [bill] will be low- and middle-income Americans.\" Senate Republicans' proposal mirrors the House proposal in many ways, including a work requirement and significant cost-shifting onto states. Senate Republicans are proposing updates that could improve and expand access to a handful of tax benefits that help families pay for child care, including the Child and Dependent Care tax credit. \"Expanding child care tax credits in the Senate bill is a step in the right direction toward making care more affordable and accessible for families nationwide,\" Sarah Rittling, executive director of First Five Years Fund, said in a statement. Her organization advocates for affordable access to quality child care and early learning. Researchers and child policy experts are less supportive of proposed changes to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC). The EITC is essentially an anti-poverty program in the form of a refundable tax credit that AEI's Kevin Corinth points out provides low-income, working families with extra help. Congressional Republicans are proposing additional administrative hurdles that families would have to overcome to qualify. Namely, requiring that they go through an onerous precertification process for their children before being able to claim the credit. This additional step would be a burden not only on families but on the IRS, which has been the subject of severe staff cuts by the Trump administration. Then there's the current Child Tax Credit, which can lower a family's tax bill by up to $2,000 per child. House Republicans want to increase that to $2,500. But households have to earn a certain amount of income to be eligible for the full credit. Republicans are also \"making what is, in theory, a new higher credit much harder for families with children to actually receive,\" says Megan Curran, policy director with the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University. Current law requires children to be either U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents to be eligible for the CTC. The House bill could disqualify more than 4.5 million children, Curran estimates, because it would require both parents to have a Social Security number. The Senate bill would require that only one parent have a Social Security number for their child to be eligible. It's unclear how many children that change would still disqualify.\u00a0 The bill would also continue current policy, blocking the lowest-income families from qualifying for the full tax credit. \"Under current policy, a two-adult, two-child family needs at least $36,000 [in income] in order to get the full [credit],\" Curran says. \"That's 1 in 4 kids nationwide who are left out of the full credit.\" On the other hand, wealthy households earning up to $200,000 for individuals, or $400,000 for couples, can claim the full credit.\u00a0 This disparity would get even more pronounced if the credit grows, Curran says, with that two-adult, two-child family now needing to earn $48,000 to claim the full credit. \"As a result, under the House Reconciliation Bill, 1 out of every 3 children would be left out of the full credit nationwide,\" Curran says. Senate Republicans are pitching a smaller increase to the CTC, to $2,200, but the underlying machinery would similarly limit the benefit for the lowest-income households. Many countries employ some kind of child benefit for families, but Curran says the U.S. is unusual in that \"we exclude the families with lower and moderate incomes. And those are children who arguably could really benefit from this type of investment the most.\" In 2021, Congress briefly increased and expanded the child tax credit to include the nation's lowest-income families. The expansion was short-lived \u2014 just six months \u2014 but research shows it helped cut the share of children living in poverty by nearly half. Research shows investing in vulnerable children isn't just a benefit to them and their families, it also provides lifetime returns to the nation. \"Every dollar that you spend on the child tax credit in an expanded form that reaches all kids would return at least $10 a year,\" Curran says. That's because children would be healthier, she says, and do better in school. Later, they would get better jobs and pay more back into the system, in the form of taxes.

While the bill would be a boon to wealthy Americans, it would scale back resources for the nation's poorest households, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warned in a recent letter to lawmakers.\n\nIn an effort to pay for an extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, Republicans in both the House and Senate want to change or reduce key social safety net programs that provide health care, food benefits and financial assistance for millions of children.\n\nMore than 37 million children are enrolled in either Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a federal program that provides affordable health insurance to pregnant mothers and children who live just above Medicaid's poverty threshold. Combined, Medicaid and CHIP protect nearly half of all children in the United States, beginning with important prenatal care, covering over 40% of U.S. births as well as nearly half of all rural births, and continuing to insure millions of vulnerable children into young adulthood.\n\nCongressional Republicans want to continue to allow states to impose waiting periods before families can enroll in CHIP and to lock them out of the program if they fail to keep up with premiums. They also propose changing Medicaid to include a first-ever national work requirement.\n\nAs the House bill is written, it would exempt parents, \"but what we've seen from past experience with work requirements is that exemptions are not always effective,\" says Allison Orris, director of Medicaid policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nSenate Republicans propose going even further, with a part-time work requirement including parents of children over 14. \"If [parents'] earnings go up because they're complying, that actually could be good for the kids,\" says Kevin Corinth, who studies poverty and safety net programs at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute (AEI). \"Because there is good research showing that, when parents work and we get more earnings coming into the household, that can improve current and future outcomes [for children].\"\n\nIn addition to work requirements, Republicans are proposing other changes that would create new administrative hurdles for families, according to Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families. \"When there's more red tape, we know that it's harder for families,\" says Joan Alker, head of the center and a Georgetown research professor. \"To see these kinds of cuts is very, very scary.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson's office defended the changes in a press release, writing that \"Republicans are protecting and strengthening Medicaid for American citizens who need and deserve it by rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.\" He also claimed on NBC's Meet the Press, \"there are no Medicaid cuts in the Big, Beautiful Bill. We're not cutting Medicaid.\"\n\nYet CBO estimates the House bill would cut federal spending on Medicaid by roughly $800 billion over the next decade, and the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation focused on improving health care access, estimates 1 in 5 children could be at risk of losing their Medicaid coverage if the House proposal goes into place.\n\nAlker says the House changes would force states to make difficult decisions about whether to cut services or raise taxes. \"Governors are gonna have to do the dirty work,\" she says.

    "text": "The state, which has long ranked worst in the US for child wellbeing, became the first and only in the country to offer free childcare to a majority of families There was a moment, just before the pandemic, when Lisset Sanchez thought she might have to drop out of college because the cost of keeping her three children in daycare was just too much. Even with support from the state, she and her husband were paying $800 a month \u2013 about half of what Sanchez and her husband paid for their mortgage in Las Cruces, New Mexico. But during the pandemic, that cost went down to $0. And Sanchez was not only able to finish college, but enroll in nursing school. With a scholarship that covered her tuition and free childcare, Sanchez could afford to commute to school, buy groceries for her growing family \u2013 even after she had two more children \u2013 and pay down the family\u2019s mortgage and car loan. \u201cWe are a one-income household,\u201d said Sanchez, whose husband works while she is in school. Having free childcare \u201cdid help tremendously\u201d. Around the same time, Ofelia Gonzalez and her sister began receiving assistance from the state to develop their at-home childcare center in south-western Albuquerque, called Mis Conejitos. The state started reimbursing their work at higher rates, which allowed them to buy toys and swings for the backyard, and raised wages for childcare workers across the state, which allowed Gonzalez to begin saving \u201cso that I can have good credit and in time I can have my own home\u201d, she said in Spanish. The changes in Sanchez and Gonzalez\u2019s lives are intertwined. Three years ago, New Mexico became the first state in the nation to offer free childcare to a majority of families. The United States has no federal, universal childcare \u2013 and ranks 40th on a Unicef ranking of 41 high-income countries\u2019 childcare policies, while maintaining some of the highest childcare costs in the world. Expanding on pandemic-era assistance, New Mexico made childcare free for families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level, or about $124,000 for a family of four. That meant about half of New Mexican children now qualified. In one of the poorest states in the nation, where the median household income is half that and childcare costs for two children could take up 80% of a family\u2019s income, the impact was powerful. The state, which had long ranked worst in the nation for child wellbeing, saw its poverty rate begin to fall. As the state simultaneously raised wages for childcare workers, and became the first to base its subsidy reimbursement rates on the actual cost of providing such care, early childhood educators were also raised out of poverty. In 2020, 27.4% of childcare providers \u2013 often women of color \u2013 were living in poverty. By 2024, that number had fallen to 16%. During the state\u2019s recent legislative session, lawmakers approved a \u201chistoric\u201d increase in funding for education, including early childhood education, that might improve those numbers even further. \u201cThis is a big investment that we know is going to pay off,\u201d said Elizabeth Groginsky, cabinet secretary of New Mexico\u2019s nascent early childhood education and care department. She points to research from the Nobel-winning economist James Heckman that \u201cevery dollar spent on high-quality, birth-to-five programs for disadvantaged children can deliver a 13% per annum return on investment from better education and health outcomes for children, employment gains for parents, greater economic productivity and reduced spending on healthcare and crime. \u201cThe governor has seen that this investment in our human capital is as important as all the investments we\u2019re making in our infrastructure,\u201d said Groginsky. Despite the fact that widespread poverty has kept the state\u2019s child wellbeing rates low, \u201cNew Mexico had, almost from statehood, a real culture around caring for children,\u201d said Hailey Heinz, a senior research scientist and deputy director of the University of New Mexico\u2019s Cradle to Career Policy Institute. Both Republican and Democratic administrations have never been \u201cparticularly stingy with the social safety net\u201d, she said, citing the Democratic lieutenant governor, Diane Denish, who led efforts to offer free pre-kindergarten to all the state\u2019s four-year-olds in 2005, and the Republican governor, Susana Martinez, who expanded Medicaid in 2013. After Medicaid was expanded in the state, a coalition of community groups came together to advocate for the next policy they thought could advance child wellbeing: universal childcare. When now-governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced her candidacy in late 2016, she emphasized her desire to address the state\u2019s low child wellbeing rating. And when she took office in January 2018, she described her aim to have a \u201cmoonshot for education\u201d: major investments in education across the state, from early childhood through college. That led to her opening the state\u2019s early childhood education and care department in 2019 \u2013 and tapping Groginksy, who had overseen efforts to improve early childhood policies in Washington DC, to run it. Then, in 2020, Lujan Grisham threw her support behind a bill in the state legislature that would establish an Early Childhood Trust Fund: by investing $300m \u2013 plus budget surpluses each year, largely from oil and gas revenue \u2013 the state hoped to distribute a percentage to fund early childhood education each year. But then, just weeks after the trust fund was established, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. \u201cCovid created a really enormous moment for childcare,\u201d said Heinz. \u201cWe had somewhat of a national reckoning about the fact that we don\u2019t have a workforce if we don\u2019t have childcare.\u201d As federal funding flooded into New Mexico, the state directed millions of dollars toward childcare, including by boosting pay for entry-level childcare providers to $15 an hour, expanding eligibility for free childcare to families making 400% of the poverty level, and becoming the first state in the nation to set childcare subsidy rates at the true cost of delivering care. \u201cThe governor saw this as an opportunity to accelerate and advance her agenda for children and families because we had the relief money,\u201d said Groginsky. As pandemic-era relief funding dried up in 2022, the governor and Democratic lawmakers proposed another way to generate funds for childcare \u2013 directing a portion of the state\u2019s Land Grant Permanent Fund to early childhood education and care. Like the Early Childhood Trust Fund, the permanent fund \u2013 which was established when New Mexico became a state \u2013 was funded by taxes on fossil fuel revenues. That November, 70% of New Mexican voters approved a constitutional amendment directing 1.25% of the fund to early childhood programs. By then, the Early Childhood Trust Fund had grown exponentially \u2013 due to the boom in oil and gas prices. Beginning with $300m in 2020, the fund had swollen to over $9bn by the end of 2024. The second greatest oil- and gas-producing state in the US, much of New Mexico\u2019s state budget comes from fossil fuels. \u201cIt\u2019s the blessing and curse of living in New Mexico,\u201d said Gabrielle Uballez, executive director of NM Voices for Children. But while oil and gas is booming, she says advocates hope to \u201ctake advantage of that so that kids and families are benefiting \u2013 not the oil and gas industry by itself, and not corporations by itself\u201d. New Mexico has long had one of the highest \u201cofficial poverty rates\u201d in the nation. But using a metric that accounts for social safety net programs \u2013 like universal childcare \u2013 that\u2019s slowly shifting. According to \u201csupplemental poverty\u201d data, 17.1% of New Mexicans fell below the federal \u201csupplemental\u201d poverty line from 2013 to 2015 (a metric that takes into account cost of living and social supports) \u2013 making it the fifth poorest state in the nation by that measure. But today, that number has fallen to 10.9%, one of the biggest changes in the country, amounting to 120,000 fewer New Mexicans living in poverty. New Mexico\u2019s child wellbeing ranking \u2013 which is based heavily on \u201cofficial poverty\u201d rankings \u2013 probably won\u2019t budge, says Heinz because \u201cthe amount of money coming into households, that they have to run their budget, remains very low. \u201cHowever, the thing New Mexico has done that\u2019s fairly tremendous, I think, is around families not having to have as much money going out,\u201d she said. During the recent legislative session, lawmakers deepened their investments in early childhood education even further, approving a 21.6% increase of $170m for education programs \u2013 including early childhood education. However, other legislation that advocates had hoped might pass stalled in the legislature, including a bill to require businesses to offer paid family medical leave. In her budget recommendations, Lujan Grisham asked the state to up its commitment to early childhood policies, by raising the wage floor for childcare workers to $18 an hour and establishing a career lattice for them. Because of that, Gonzalez has been able to start working on her associate\u2019s in childhood education at Central New Mexico Community College where her tuition is waived. The governor also backed a house bill that will increase the amount of money distributed annually from the Early Childhood Trust Fund \u2013 since its dramatic growth due to oil and gas revenues. Although funding childcare through the Land Grant Permanent Fund is unique to New Mexico \u2013 and a handful of other states with permanent funds, like Alaska, Texas and North Dakota \u2013 Heinz says the Early Childhood Trust fund \u201cholds interesting lessons for other states\u201d about investing a percentage of revenues into early childhood programs. In New Mexico, those revenues come largely from oil and gas, but New Mexico Voices for Children has put forth recommendations about how the state can continue funding childcare while transitioning away from fossil fuels, largely by raising taxes on the state\u2019s wealthiest earners. Although other states have not yet followed in New Mexico\u2019s footsteps, a growing number are making strides to offer free pre-K to a majority of their residents. Heinz cautions that change won\u2019t occur overnight. \u201cWhat New Mexico is trying to do here is play a very long game. And so I am not without worry that people might give it five years, and it\u2019s been almost five years now, and then say, where are the results? Why is everything not better?\u201d she said. \u201cThis is generational change\u201d that New Mexico is only just beginning to witness as the first children who were recipients of universal childcare start school. Sanchez urges other New Mexican families to take advantage of the opportunity to access free childcare. \u201cBeing able to work for free or go to school for free, that can make a big difference in your life and your children\u2019s \u2013 everybody\u2019s \u2013 life.\u201d",

She points to research from the Nobel-winning economist James Heckman that \u201cevery dollar spent on high-quality, birth-to-five programs for disadvantaged children can deliver a 13% per annum return on investment from better education and health outcomes for children, employment gains for parents, greater economic productivity and reduced spending on healthcare and crime.\n\n\u201cThe governor has seen that this investment in our human capital is as important as all the investments we\u2019re making in our infrastructure,\u201d said Groginsky.\n\nDespite the fact that widespread poverty has kept the state\u2019s child wellbeing rates low, \u201cNew Mexico had, almost from statehood, a real culture around caring for children,\u201d said Hailey Heinz, a senior research scientist and deputy director of the University of New Mexico\u2019s Cradle to Career Policy Institute. Both Republican and Democratic administrations have never been \u201cparticularly stingy with the social safety net\u201d, she said, citing the Democratic lieutenant governor, Diane Denish, who led efforts to offer free pre-kindergarten to all the state\u2019s four-year-olds in 2005, and the Republican governor, Susana Martinez, who expanded Medicaid in 2013.\n\nAfter Medicaid was expanded in the state, a coalition of community groups came together to advocate for the next policy they thought could advance child wellbeing: universal childcare. When now-governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced her candidacy in late 2016, she emphasized her desire to address the state\u2019s low child wellbeing rating. And when she took office in January 2018, she described her aim to have a \u201cmoonshot for education\u201d: major investments in education across the state, from early childhood through college.\n\nThat led to her opening the state\u2019s early childhood education and care department in 2019 \u2013 and tapping Groginksy, who had overseen efforts to improve early childhood policies in Washington DC, to run it. Then, in 2020, Lujan Grisham threw her support behind a bill in the state legislature that would establish an Early Childhood Trust Fund: by investing $300m \u2013 plus budget surpluses each year, largely from oil and gas revenue \u2013 the state hoped to distribute a percentage to fund early childhood education each year.\n\nBut then, just weeks after the trust fund was established, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. \u201cCovid created a really enormous moment for childcare,\u201d said Heinz. \u201cWe had somewhat of a national reckoning about the fact that we don\u2019t have a workforce if we don\u2019t have childcare.\u201d As federal funding flooded into New Mexico, the state directed millions of dollars toward childcare, including by boosting pay for entry-level childcare providers to $15 an hour, expanding eligibility for free childcare to families making 400% of the poverty level, and becoming the first state in the nation to set childcare subsidy rates at the true cost of delivering care.\n\n\u201cThe governor saw this as an opportunity to accelerate and advance her agenda for children and families because we had the relief money,\u201d said Groginsky.\n\nAs pandemic-era relief funding dried up in 2022, the governor and Democratic lawmakers proposed another way to generate funds for childcare \u2013 directing a portion of the state\u2019s Land Grant Permanent Fund to early childhood education and care. Like the Early Childhood Trust Fund, the permanent fund \u2013 which was established when New Mexico became a state \u2013 was funded by taxes on fossil fuel revenues. That November, 70% of New Mexican voters approved a constitutional amendment directing 1.25% of the fund to early childhood programs.\n\nBy then, the Early Childhood Trust Fund had grown exponentially \u2013 due to the boom in oil and gas prices. Beginning with $300m in 2020, the fund had swollen to over $9bn by the end of 2024.\n\nThe second greatest oil- and gas-producing state in the US, much of New Mexico\u2019s state budget comes from fossil fuels. \u201cIt\u2019s the blessing and curse of living in New Mexico,\u201d said Gabrielle Uballez, executive director of NM Voices for Children. But while oil and gas is booming, she says advocates hope to \u201ctake advantage of that so that kids and families are benefiting \u2013 not the oil and gas industry by itself, and not corporations by itself\u201d.\n\nNew Mexico has long had one of the highest \u201cofficial poverty rates\u201d in the nation. But using a metric that accounts for social safety net programs \u2013 like universal childcare \u2013 that\u2019s slowly shifting. According to \u201csupplemental poverty\u201d data, 17.1% of New Mexicans fell below the federal \u201csupplemental\u201d poverty line from 2013 to 2015 (a metric that takes into account cost of living and social supports) \u2013 making it the fifth poorest state in the nation by that measure. But today, that number has fallen to 10.9%, one of the biggest changes in the country, amounting to 120,000 fewer New Mexicans living in poverty.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s child wellbeing ranking \u2013 which is based heavily on \u201cofficial poverty\u201d rankings \u2013 probably won\u2019t budge, says Heinz because \u201cthe amount of money coming into households, that they have to run their budget, remains very low. \u201cHowever, the thing New Mexico has done that\u2019s fairly tremendous, I think, is around families not having to have as much money going out,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring the recent legislative session, lawmakers deepened their investments in early childhood education even further, approving a 21.6% increase of $170m for education programs \u2013 including early childhood education. However, other legislation that advocates had hoped might pass stalled in the legislature, including a bill to require businesses to offer paid family medical leave.\n\nIn her budget recommendations, Lujan Grisham asked the state to up its commitment to early childhood policies, by raising the wage floor for childcare workers to $18 an hour and establishing a career lattice for them. Because of that, Gonzalez has been able to start working on her associate\u2019s in childhood education at Central New Mexico Community College where her tuition is waived.\n\nThe governor also backed a house bill that will increase the amount of money distributed annually from the Early Childhood Trust Fund \u2013 since its dramatic growth due to oil and gas revenues.\n\nAlthough funding childcare through the Land Grant Permanent Fund is unique to New Mexico \u2013 and a handful of other states with permanent funds, like Alaska, Texas and North Dakota \u2013 Heinz says the Early Childhood Trust fund \u201cholds interesting lessons for other states\u201d about investing a percentage of revenues into early childhood programs. In New Mexico, those revenues come largely from oil and gas, but New Mexico Voices for Children has put forth recommendations about how the state can continue funding childcare while transitioning away from fossil fuels, largely by raising taxes on the state\u2019s wealthiest earners.\n\nAlthough other states have not yet followed in New Mexico\u2019s footsteps, a growing number are making strides to offer free pre-K to a majority of their residents. Heinz cautions that change won\u2019t occur overnight. \u201cWhat New Mexico is trying to do here is play a very long game. And so I am not without worry that people might give it five years, and it\u2019s been almost five years now, and then say, where are the results? Why is everything not better?\u201d she said. \u201cThis is generational change\u201d that New Mexico is only just beginning to witness as the first children who were recipients of universal childcare start school.\n\nSanchez urges other New Mexican families to take advantage of the opportunity to access free childcare. \u201cBeing able to work for free or go to school for free, that can make a big difference in your life and your children\u2019s \u2013 everybody\u2019s \u2013 life.\u201d",

    "text": "  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The average wealth gap between white families and Black and Hispanic ones reached a new high in 2022, topping $1 million in household wealth, according to a new report.\u00a0 New research by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic and social policy research, found that the average wealth of white families in 2022 reached a record high of over $1.3 million, compared to about $227,000 for Hispanic families and $211,000 for Black families. This report marks the first time the institute has recorded a seven-figure disparity in average wealth for both Black and Hispanic households. The median wealth for white families was $284,000, compared to $62,000 for Hispanic families and $44,000 for Black families.\u00a0 \u201cInequities measured at the median will give you a better sense of the comparisons across typical families, but inequities measured at the mean will give you a better sense of the macro-level disparities in wealth accumulation in this country \u2014 generally, and by race,\u201d said Madeline Brown, a senior policy associate at the Urban Institute. She added that both numbers are important to consider because they are the result of structural racism. \u201cOne million dollars in a gap indicates that we still have severe racial wealth inequity in this country,\u201d Brown said. That lifetime difference in accruing wealth severely affects families\u2019 ability to \u201cbuy a home, invest in their children\u2019s college, invest in their children\u2019s businesses, support their families,\u201d she added. The report shows how racial and gender gaps in earnings, retirement savings and emergency savings can contribute to a lifetime lag for individuals and families. But homeownership is the primary driver of wealth-building in the U.S., the report said, and continues to lag for Black families in particular because of \u201cthe stubborn legacy of racist housing policies.\u201d The average white homeownership rate has increased from about 64.9% in 1960 to 73.1% in 2022, according to the report, while Black homeownership has gone from 38.2% to 44.3% in the same period. Hispanic and Asian families both saw their highest recorded average homeownership rates in 2022, at 51.1% and 63.2%, respectively, but still lagged behind the rates of white families. The research also found that significant disparities continue in individual lifetime earnings between white, Black and Hispanic people. Data shows the average white man born between 1960 and 1964 earned $2.9 million over the course of his career, compared to less than $1.8 million for the average Black man and about $1.7 million for Hispanic men. The average white woman in the same age bracket earned $1.7 million over the course of her career, compared to less than $1.3 million for Black women and $883,000 for Hispanic women. \u201cIn a nation that professes that those who work hard and play by the rules should be rewarded with social and economic upward mobility, these persistent disparities are a stark reminder that, as a society, we have not achieved this goal,\u201d the report said. The Urban Institute\u2019s data comes largely from the Survey of Consumer Finances conducted every three years by the Federal Reserve. The 2022 survey was the first time data was disaggregated for Asian Americans, who had the highest average family wealth of any group that year at $1.8 million. Other data shows that household income varies greatly among Asian American groups. When it comes to solutions, the report proposes a series of policy changes to help close the racial wealth gap, including limits to the mortgage interest tax deduction and reparations for Black Americans. \u201cLooking at that $1 million gap, reparations are, depending on how they\u2019re delivered, a promising policy in bringing that gap down,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBecause the history is such that these policies have compounded on themselves and created a situation where, overall, our wealth distribution in this country is incredibly inequitable.\u201d Isabela Espadas Barros Leal was a former platforms editor and associate editor for NBC News Digital. \u00a9\u00a02025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

    "text": "ByChristian Weller, Senior Contributor. Wealth is the difference between what people own and what they owe. It serves as a financial buffer in an emergency and as a means toward upward economic mobility. People can use their wealth to buy a new house, move if better job opportunities open up elsewhere and support their families\u2019 education, among other things.  Yet wealth is distributed in highly unequal ways, especially by race and ethnicity, and those gaps show no sign of abating. This leaves Black and Latino/Hispanic households in financially more vulnerable situations and with fewer opportunities for upward economic mobility.   The Federal Reserve\u2019s Distributional Financial Accounts show, among other things, total wealth by race and ethnicity \u2013 for Black, Latino and white households. This dataset also includes quarterly estimates of the number of households in each racialized population category. The data then allow for the calculation of the average per-household wealth for Black, Latino/Hispanic and white households on a quarterly basis from 1989 to 2023.  The wealth differences between Black and Latino/Hispanic households, on the one side, and white households, on the other side, stayed large through 2023. Black households typically have less than one-fourth of the average wealth of white households. By September 2023, the latest quarter for which data are available, Black households owned 23.5% of the wealth of white households. The average wealth of Latino households was less than one-fifth \u2014 19.2% \u2014 of that of white households (see figure below). Black and Latino households thus face greater risks and less economic mobility than is the case for white households.  Average wealth heavily skews toward wealthier households. Median wealth \u2014 which evenly divides groups by wealth \u2014 better reflects the typical household\u2019s wealth in each group. Data from the Federal Reserve\u2019s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances shows that Black and Latino households also have much lower median wealth than was the case for white households in 2022, the last year for which these data are available.  For instance, the median wealth of African Americans amounted to $44,900 or 15.8% of the median wealth of white households ($285,000) in 2022. In comparison, the median Latino/Hispanic household owned $61,600 in 2022, or 21.6% of the median wealth of white households. By either measure \u2014 average or median wealth \u2014 Black and Latino/Hispanic households face greater economic risks or fewer economic opportunities than is the case for white households.  Importantly, the gaps in household wealth by race and ethnicity show few signs of diminishing. Average wealth grew substantially for all groups during and after the pandemic. But the wealth gaps by race and ethnicity stayed fairly constant. The average wealth of Black households amounted to 23.7% of the average wealth of white households in December 2019, before the pandemic and its financial market disruptions started (see figures below and above). The average wealth of Latino households equaled 18.6% of the average white household\u2019s wealth then. At least the racial and ethnic wealth gaps did not worsen, as they did during and after the Great Recession (see figures below and above), and as they have been since 1989.  Less wealth means fewer financial protections during an emergency such as a family member getting sick, someone getting laid off or a car needing repairs, among other events. Black and Latino households had on average much fewer liquid dollars on average than was the case for white households. In September 2023, the average Black household owned $24,288 in checking accounts, money market mutual funds and other liquid savings. This was 14.5% of the average amount of liquid savings of $167,234 for white households at the same time. The total liquid savings of Latino households stood at $25,299 or 15.1% of what white households owned (see figure below).  Median liquid savings were much lower one year earlier in 2022, as data from the Survey of Consumer Finances shows. The median amount was $2,010 for Black households, $2,000 for Latino households and $12,000 for white households. Black and Latino households regularly have to face an economic emergency with smaller financial protections than is the case for white households.  Households, especially Black and Latino families, needed to dip into their savings repeatedly when inflation increased in late 2021 and early 2022. Many households had built up savings thanks to stimulus checks \u2014 officially known as Economic Impact Payments \u2014 and other benefits such as expanded child tax credits (see figure below). But, by September 2023, those extra savings were largely gone, in part to cover higher costs and in part to buy a house amid rising prices. Black households on average had $6,556 dollars less in liquid savings in September 2023 than in December 2019. In comparison, Latino households had roughly the same amount then as they did before the pandemic started, while white households had 13.4% more \u2013 or $19,768 (see figure below). Black and Latino households are regularly in a much worse position to weather a financial emergency than is the case for white households.  Part of the decline in liquid savings likely came from some households using those funds as down payments for a house amid rising real estate prices. The homeownership rates of all racial and ethnic groups grew during the pandemic, census data show. By the third quarter of 2023, 45.5% of Black households and 49.4% of Latino/Hispanic households owned their own house, while this was the case for 74.5% of white households. These numbers show more widespread homeownership than in 2019, when 44% of Black households, 48.1% of Latino/Hispanic households and 73.7% of white households owned their own home. But, considering the trend in liquid savings, especially Black and Latino/Hispanic homeowners increasingly face more risks than white households do.  Household wealth has increased for all population groups during the pandemic. Pre-existing wealth gaps by race and ethnicity largely stayed in place during that time.  While some households gained access to homeownership, that upward mobility may have come with greater short-term financial risks. In other words, Black and Latino/Hispanic households had to choose between a short-term financial safety blanket and longer-term economic mobility and stability more often than white households did.

But, considering the trend in liquid savings, especially Black and Latino/Hispanic homeowners increasingly face more risks than white households do.\n\nHousehold wealth has increased for all population groups during the pandemic. Pre-existing wealth gaps by race and ethnicity largely stayed in place during that time.\n\nWhile some households gained access to homeownership, that upward mobility may have come with greater short-term financial risks. In other words, Black and Latino/Hispanic households had to choose between a short-term financial safety blanket and longer-term economic mobility and stability more often than white households did.",

    "text": "ByDan Doonan, Contributor. One of the defining challenges of our time is the growing problem of economic inequality in the United States. In 2021, the top ten percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent in 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent dropped correspondingly over that period, while the bottom 50 percent (some 63 million families) owned only about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021. Not only does this economic inequality create hardships for families, experts agree that it is fueling discontent and political polarization in America.   As income and wealth inequality have spiked dramatically during the past forty years, advocates, researchers, and policymakers spanning the ideological spectrum have offered explanations on causes and potential solutions. But one counterweight to increasing inequality that hasn\u2019t received as much attention is defined benefit pension plans. A new report provides a first-of-a-kind analysis on just how important pensions are in reducing wealth inequality.  Closing The GapGPS, jointly issued by the National Institute on Retirement Security and the UC Berkeley Labor Center, examines the role of pensions in providing adequate income to retirees analyzed by race, gender, and educational attainment. It also focuses on the role of pension plans in creating retirement wealth for workers.  Pensions Dramatically Boost Wealth, Especially for Blacks and Latinos The wealth-building effect of pensions is important, but often overlooked. When thinking about households accumulating wealth, it\u2019s typically thought of as owning stocks or a home, but not the value of a retirement plan like a pension. In fact, a retirement plan often is one of the largest financial assets of many households. Thus, it\u2019s important to consider the impact of pensions in closing the wealth gap. The new report finds that including the value of pension income in household wealth boosts the typical (median) net worth of older families substantially\u2013 a whopping 36 percent. The power of pensions is even more substantial for older Black families. Pensions increase their median net worth by a staggering 86 percent, with public pensions providing more than half of this impact. And for older Latino families that historically have been underrepresented in the public sector, pension benefits increase their median wealth by 32.4 percent.  While other research has noted that pension plans tend to lessen the degree of inequality in the U.S., this report is the first to assign specific numbers to the large wealth impact of pensions. But the findings come as pensions are on the decline in the private sector, leaving Social Security and public pension plans as the two remaining protectors of retirement security for middle-class families. This is especially true for Black workers, who have found public sector employment to be a pathway to the middle class due to the history of occupational segregation in the U.S. While defined benefit pensions remain common in the public sector, legislative changes in recent years have led to plans with tiers with less generous benefits, the establishment of hybrid plans that include both pension plan and defined contribution (DC) plan components, or a choice between a pension or a DC plan. As the impacts of these changes are more fully felt in future years when more workers begin retiring under these new plans or tiers, the inequality-dampening effects of public pension plans may decline somewhat. In the meantime, the economic impact for today\u2019s retirees is more significant than most people realize, as public and private sector pension benefit payments in 2020 exceeded $600 billion nationwide. Pensions Also Boost Wealth for Women and Those Without a College Degree  Closing the Gap also shows the importance of pension plans for women and those without a four-year college degree. The report finds that public pension income is distributed more equally by gender than private pension and 401(k) income, which reflects different employment patterns by women. In addition, retirees fare better economically with a pension regardless of educational attainment, with the largest improvement among those without bachelor\u2019s degrees.  Closing the Gap uses 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) as a helpful benchmark to assess the poverty-alleviating impact of pensions. And this impact is profound. Across all retirees, a significantly larger share of U.S. retirees with pension income were above 200 percent FPL in 2018-2020 (91%) compared to retirees without pension income (60%). Retired Black women, Latino men, and Black men were twice as likely to have incomes above 200 percent FPL if they had a pension. Those with no college education, but who have a pension, were 73 percent more likely to be above 200 percent of the FPL than those with no college education and no pension. And those pension benefits translate into meaningful retirement income. Those with a high school degree or less, but who had a pension, had $169,000 in pension wealth - significantly more retirement resources than typically seen among this group of workers.  Social Security and pensions, supplemented by 401(k)s and personal savings, supported the retirement security of the American middle class for decades. While these programs continue to provide substantial retirement income for retirees today, they face stiff headwinds. Social Security faces funding challenges, pensions are no longer widely available to private-sector workers, and 401(k) plans are underfunded except for the highest income workers. For most families, 401(k) savings and Social Security just won't provide sufficient retirement income, and the problem is even worse for women, Blacks, Latinos, and those lacking a college degree.  Thanks to this important new analysis, we now have data that for the first time shows the power of pensions for addressing a major economic and political problem facing the U.S. - economic inequality. Clearly, pensions play an outsized role in closing the growing wealth and retirement gap. Perhaps policymakers should place a higher priority on making pensions more widely available to working Americans. Not only would pensions improve working Americans\u2019 financial outlook, but the reduced stress also could play a significant role in addressing the social discontent that is ailing the nation.",

    "text": "ByImperial Business Insights, Contributor. Over the last 50 years we\u2019ve seen a trend. Wealth is growing, there\u2019s no doubt about that. In the year 2000 for instance, Forbes estimated there were just 470 billionaires in the world, owning $898 billion collectively. Fast forward to 2021, and Forbes\u2019 annual rich list named 2,755 billionaires, with the top six collectively earning more than all 470 billionaires from the 2000 list combined.  When you flip the coin however, though wealth is soaring for many, there\u2019s a far larger number of people whose circumstances are getting worse. The cost-of-living crisis, as well as soaring inflation, is causing many people\u2019s real wage to drop significantly. The picture is the same across the pond in Europe too. In the UK, the number of people seeking help to feed themselves and their families through food banks has increased from 26,000 in 2010, to more than 2.56 million in 2022. At the same time, the cumulative wealth of the top ten billionaires in the UK has grown from \u00a348 billion in 2009 to \u00a3182 billion in 2022 - an increase of 281 percent. Clearly the gulf between rich and the poor has become much more pronounced. Wealth inequality is a hugely important issue for governments and policymakers, but the current evidence makes long-term country comparisons difficult, and doesn\u2019t help us to clearly understand the reasons behind such stark differences in wealth inequality trajectories.  With my colleague, Thomas Blanchet from the Paris School of Economics, we gathered all the necessary data to build the first Distributional Wealth Accounts for Europe. Our intention was to compare wealth inequality between Europe and the United States over the last five decades.  Having built the database, we started our research by analysing the evolution of aggregate wealth \u2013 which is defined as a person\u2019s total assets and investments net of liabilities. We calculated the ratio of each country\u2019s household net wealth to national income. This ratio indicates whether individual countries in Europe and the US are becoming richer or poorer.  We then explored the differences between Europe and the US by focusing on three key drivers of wealth accumulation: differences in savings, wages, and capital gains - of which the profit from property sales forms a key part. So, what were the results? Europe has experienced (slightly) faster growth in aggregate wealth compared to the US  We found the evolution of aggregate household wealth (relative to income) was similar in Europe and the US, steadily increasing from three times the national income in 1970 to five times the national income in the US and six times the national income in Europe in 2018.  The reason why the wealth to income ratio was slightly higher in Europe than in the US is mainly due to a bigger decline in house prices in the US during the global financial crisis.  The evolution of wealth among the wealthiest one percent of the population tells a different story  However, when we analysed the evolution of the top one percent wealth share in each of these regions, we found that, while Europe experienced moderate growth, the growth in the US was significantly higher. In other words, the gap between rich and poor in the US became much more pronounced. This was true whether compared to the European average or any single European country.  How can we explain these differences? To examine the drivers, we ran simulations that substituted the labour income inequality and asset price trajectories from France into the US figures. We found the US wealth concentration levels were lower because of the smaller rise in labour income inequality and the larger rise in house prices relative to financial assets in Europe. This would benefit middle income individuals more, as they have a larger share of housing in their portfolio. The results were similar when we substituted the same figures from other European countries into the US data.  Our research leads us to make three calls to action for policymakers:  1. Job market policies are crucial to reducing wealth inequality  We have shown labour income inequality has been an important factor behind the growing gap between rich and poor in the US. Controlling unemployment and designing policies aimed at boosting wages at the lower end of the market must be a priority if wealth inequality is to be reduced.  2. Central banks must play a key role in stabilising house prices  Since housing is an asset that has a disproportionate impact on middle income individuals, it is important prices are stabilised to prevent financial crises and the rise in wealth disparities.  3. Official institutions need to collect more and better wealth data Our research has made some progress in understanding the differences in wealth inequality trajectories between Europe and the US. We know much less about the evolution of wealth inequalities in the emerging and developing world. To design policies aimed at mitigating the rise of wealth inequalities, we first need to understand the levels and trajectories of wealth disparities within and across countries. If governments do not address the wealth gap with equitable policies and inclusive growth, more people will suffer from rising economic inequality.

    "text": "My family is a success story. We\u2019re also evidence of the long odds African Americans face on the path to success. Wealth is a number, sure, but it\u2019s also a feeling. I grew up living with my mom and maternal grandparents, while my dad played and coached in the NBA. For a time, our family\u2019s safety net was held together by my grandfather\u2019s HVAC business, but in 2001, it nearly came apart. That year, the company worked on a project performing mechanical-contracting work at Lincoln Financial Field, the home of the Philadelphia Eagles. The timeline did not account for delays. My grandfather estimates that the company lost $4 million on the project. Our house was put on the market shortly after. I loved that house because it felt like home, but also because it made me feel at home in a predominantly white world, where I felt as if my every move was on display. The house served as a symbol of wealth to justify belonging. When we sold it, I felt exposed, as though my family was showcasing the fragility of black wealth for all to see. I told friends that my family wanted to downsize. I\u2019m sure they saw through the lie. Americans are uncomfortable talking about money. We use careers, homes, and clothing to stand in as proxies. Certain markers in these areas signify wealth, regardless of the actual amount in your bank account. I harbor no delusions about how privileged my family and I are. As an adult, I am thankful every day for how much my family sacrificed for my freedom. But I also know that, as a whole, black wealth is delicate, because for generations lawmakers and power wielders attempted to prevent African Americans from building it. When I set out to write this story, I wanted to better understand the intricate narratives that make wealth in the black community so complex. My own understanding was rooted in the idea that while my family represented a version of the American dream, the injustices that have kept black families without a safety net for generations still reverberated throughout our history. I found those historical echoes still ringing in the stories of other families, too. A raft of policies responsible for building the American middle class destroyed opportunities for black people to build intergenerational wealth. According to 2013 data from a paper by the progressive think tank Institute for Policy Studies, if the average wealth held by white families magically stopped growing, it would take 228 years for the average wealth held by African Americans to catch up. When researchers from the institute looked at median wealth from 1983 to 2016 (adjusting for inflation), black families saw their wealth decrease by more than half, while white families saw theirs rise by 33 percent. While white families have a median wealth of $171,000, black families have a median wealth of just $17,600. These relationships aren\u2019t fixed. Once you get a certain amount of wealth, keeping it within your family is much easier. It took until 1976 for the government to introduce the generation-skipping transfer tax, which was instituted to stop individuals from avoiding federal estate taxes by leaving money to their grandchildren. In 2010 (when the estate and generation-skipping taxes were briefly repealed), an estate could again escape paying those taxes on its fortunes. In Donald Trump\u2019s 2019 State of the Union address, he praised himself for raising the estate-tax exemption to $11.2 million, which resulted in, the Tax Policy Center estimates, taxing less than 0.1 percent of estates (or about 1,900 households). America\u2019s tax system protects the wealth that already exists, instead of the wealth that might exist if more families were in a position to build it. That my grandfather built enough wealth to get us into that house but not enough to keep it is partially a result of how much the cards have been stacked against African American wealth-building for generations. When World War II ended, my grandfather was only 6, but the discriminatory distortions of the GI Bill are still visible in our family\u2019s financial history. His father, aunt, and uncles were World War II veterans. Four of them were able to secure coveted government jobs. While this may have given them stability, it did not help them build long-term wealth to pass along. White veterans, however, were encouraged to go to college, where they graduated with degrees in subjects such as engineering, according to research by the journalist Edward Humes. Even though 49 percent of black veterans (compared with 43 percent of white veterans) took advantage of some sort of education or training offered through GI Bill benefits as of 1950, that didn\u2019t always mean a college degree. Most African American veterans who exercised their education benefits after World War II ended up pursuing vocational training, as counselors who approved the benefits steered blacks into low-paying jobs or historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). At the time, HBCUs were underfunded and did not offer engineering programs. Short on space, they were forced to turn away up to 50,000 black veterans. Humes also pointed to a survey of 6,000 job placements in Mississippi during the fall of 1946: 86 percent of the skilled, professional, and semiskilled jobs went to white veterans. My grandfather joined a union in 1956. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Act into law, policy makers drafted it to exclude agricultural and domestic workers, so black people made up less than 1 percent of union members. Black workers continued to struggle for equal treatment in unions: 31 affiliates of the American Federation of Labor explicitly excluded black workers at one point. Membership was nonetheless an important stepping stone for my grandfather. He gained entry only after his grandmother, a maid, persuaded her boss, the entrepreneur Charlie Willard, to hire her grandson. Willard helped him earn union membership and later made my grandfather a crew foreman. He got assigned to run the crew for Pennsylvania Hospital\u2019s first professionally air-conditioned building. As my grandfather tells it, the hospital quickly poached him, offering him a full-time job and eventually promoting him to a position with a salary of $35,000. Eventually my grandfather wanted more than a steady paycheck. Although he may not have thought about it at the time, he wanted to build wealth. So he started a side hustle installing air conditioners for restaurants, bars, and colleges. He branded white trucks with his name and hired a crew to help him fulfill orders while he was at the hospital. When the hospital discovered his other business, his boss gave him an ultimatum: his side hustle or his full-time job. He chose the side hustle. He recalls union companies early on working with their friends to secure low prices from suppliers, blocking him from getting projects. My grandfather\u2019s story is one of success (this year his business turns 50) that also illustrates why black success is used to claim that the playing field in America is more level than it actually is. My grandfather made it, but does his success against all odds mean that it\u2019s okay when everyone else faces those same odds and fails? A black family\u2019s success story is reassuring proof that the system works. If my family could successfully climb upward, the argument goes, then the ones who can\u2019t aren\u2019t trying hard enough. They don\u2019t have enough grit. But successful black people are also treated as extraordinary. Why? Because Americans know the system is broken. Selling our home served as a personal paradigm shift. Whereas before I felt confident of my place in the world and my ability to keep climbing, afterward I felt my risk tolerance crumbling. I began to see my family\u2019s story in the context of a larger history of a system that unfairly advantages white families at the expense of black ones. So I went to college and studied practical subjects instead of pursuing a passion. I landed jobs after college meant to build wealth, instead of pursuing writing or jobs in publishing, industries that privilege the children of wealthy families who can afford to subsidize young workers in low-paying entry-level jobs. My family, despite their struggles, gave me the means to choose differently. Even so, my initial choices highlight the complicated nature of black success: It\u2019s knowing that as you rise, you have a responsibility to make sure your family and community rise with you. For better or worse, American wealth is a family affair. Part of what I struggled with growing up is that my dad\u2019s profession is the archetype of black wealth and success. I remember overhearing a classmate once saying something along the lines of \u201cRich black people play sports.\u201d This idea about what professional sports means conflicted with the reality of a limited generational safety net. My dad still works in the NBA, coaching for Oklahoma City. He guards his emotions as well as he used to guard other players, and I recently flew there hesitant to have a frank conversation about money and, more specifically, what it was like for him to go from the South Side of Chicago to a world of success. We sat in the living room, his dog, Bailey, lying by his side, the television muted in the background. It was a high-pressure time in the season, and I was nervous that he wouldn\u2019t want to delve into the past. But as he did, I came to understand how inaccurate it is to assume that people deemed worthy as \u201cmaking it\u201d step into one world while leaving behind their own personal history. Maurice Cheeks grew up in Chicago\u2019s Robert Taylor Homes, once the largest public-housing development in the country; it\u2019s now gone\u2014the last building was torn down in 2007. The development opened in 1962, housing up to 27,000 people despite being planned to hold less than half of that. By 1975, 92 percent of the families relied on government assistance. My grandmother was well known around the building she lived in. She used to belt out my dad\u2019s and uncles\u2019 names to get them to come inside as soon as the streetlights turned on. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros once said, \u201cI don\u2019t know of another place in America where there are 15 shootings and five killings over a weekend.\u201d My dad\u2019s general feeling was that you lived your life as best you could. \u201cIt was rough,\u201d my dad told me. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t really think about it at the time.\u201d My dad will be the first to say that he did not make it out on his own. His basketball career started because a friend won a basketball scholarship to West Texas State (now West Texas A&M University) and told the coach that he would accept only if the coach also took my dad. (The coach has said that he also recognized my dad\u2019s talent). In 1978, my dad was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with a starting salary of $30,000. Today that income would be worth roughly $123,000, or just less than the mean salary for a pharmacist. My dad was making money, but at a salary that did not go as far as the public perception of professional sports portrays. It was another example, like my maternal grandfather\u2019s story, that \u201cmaking it\u201d is not the same as freedom through wealth. Read: Why black families struggle to build wealth One cannot talk about closing the wealth gap in any meaningful way without acknowledging that middle- and upper-class black families have lost and are still losing wealth because African Americans were ushered into segregated neighborhoods and denied the same benefits extended to white Americans. As soon as my dad started earning a salary, he sent much of it back to my grandmother, who continued living in the Robert Taylor Homes when he first started playing in the NBA. Research shows that my dad\u2019s experience is typical for black people who have family members in need. The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the world\u2019s longest-running longitudinal household survey, began in 1968 with 18,233 people, and now spans four generations or more. According to data from the 1994 PSID analyzed by Darrick Hamilton from the Ohio State University and Ngina Chiteji, now at New York University, 36 percent of middle-income black families\u2019 parents lived in poverty, compared with 8 percent of middle-income white families\u2019 parents. When Hamilton, Jermaine Toney (a National Science Foundation postdoctoral research fellow at Cornell University), and William A. Darity Jr. analyzed 2013 PSID data, they found that the parents of middle-income black families were more than eight times as likely to face poverty as the parents of middle-income white families. The mean net worth of black grandparents in the sample amounted to $56,713\u2014for white grandparents it was $357,831. Those family ties may add up to an unending drain on the financial resources of anyone who makes it. Hamilton and Chiteji found that family circumstances, in general, are responsible for middle-class black families having 27 percent less wealth than their white counterparts. Hamilton and Darity wrote, \u201cInheritance, bequests, and in vivo transfer account for more of the racial wealth gap than any other behavioral, demographic, or socioeconomic indicator.\u201d In other words, most people at the top of the wealth ladder are not there because of grit. More likely, the government or a family member helped lift them up\u2014by paying for their education, or giving them a loan, or helping with rent. Wealth doesn\u2019t just add lift. It ensures that when you fall, you land softly. We landed softly because my mom and her parents had something to sell\u2014our house\u2014when my grandfather\u2019s business took a wrong turn. I also had support from my father. But that\u2019s what makes us different. We\u2019re more like the typical upper-income white family than the typical black one. The economist Raj Chetty and three other researchers found that a black child born to parents whose income is in the top quintile has roughly the same likelihood of falling to the bottom quintile as remaining at the top. White children, however, are about five times as likely to stay at the top when born there than they are to drop to the bottom. Those researchers were looking only at the power of income in that part of the study. But it stands to reason that wealth helps, too. A middle-income white family is more likely to be wealthier and own their home than a black family at the same place on the income scale. If you land a plum job at Google or Goldman Sachs, staying affluent will be a lot easier if your parents have already paid off their mortgage than if they\u2019re still writing rent checks in public housing. Critics will argue that people who don\u2019t climb upward when receiving help from welfare programs are taking advantage of the system. Welfare programs, however, are not one size fits all. Each program is intricately woven with the biases of policy makers, and rarely helps families build long-term wealth. As was the case with the Robert Taylor Homes, the site selection itself was designed to maintain segregation: In 1950, the city-council aldermen approved sites only in the \u201cblack belt,\u201d instead of on the vacant land in white areas initially proposed by the Chicago Housing Authority. None of this is made easier when your family doesn\u2019t know how to talk about money. Fluency in the language of intergenerational wealth is an advantage passed down along with the money itself. When my dad left the Robert Taylor Homes and started earning a salary, he didn\u2019t know what to do with it. \u201cThe accountant came and asked me why I wasn\u2019t cashing my checks,\u201d he told me. \u201cI used to hide my checks under my mattress when I started making more money.\u201d Most Americans cannot expect one job to drastically alter their financial position. The thesis of the American dream is that consistent hard work pays off over time. But what if playing by the rules is still not enough to maintain wealth through multiple generations? What if the rules are stacked against you? I met Wendy Jones in December after learning about her mother, Josephine E. Jones. According to Wendy\u2019s research for her book about her mom\u2019s life story, An Extraordinary Life: Josephine E. Jones, Jo Jones may have been the first black woman in management at a Fortune 500 company. Wendy grew tearfully excited when talking about her mother\u2014the words couldn\u2019t come fast enough. She has meticulous files documenting her mother\u2019s life, which she carefully showed me in the back of a restaurant near her home in New Jersey one late winter afternoon. She wants her mother to be remembered not only for breaking new corporate ground, but as someone who aimed to help her family and her community achieve whatever they wanted\u2014including wealth. When Jo purchased a historic brownstone home in Harlem, her goal was to leave it to Wendy. What she ended up leaving Wendy was money, not wealth\u2014for reasons that have everything to do with why many black Americans still do not feel free in this country. Read: Getting to the bottom of Americans\u2019 fascination with wealth Jo was born in 1920 in South Carolina\u2014her father was a sharecropper. At 26, she traveled north and started working as a cook for wealthy families, often being required to stay past midnight to wash dishes and take care of the families\u2019 children. In 1953, Jo paid $100 a month in rent, which was twice the gross median rent in the New York metro area, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, but the best a black woman with a child could do. In 1951, Jo got a job working for a temp agency supplying cooks and maids to homes and companies. She received a two-week assignment to work for Standard Brands, a packaged-goods company, that ended up lasting 31 years, after the company hired her and eventually promoted her to run the employee cafeteria. When Wendy graduated from college, her mother handed her a folder full of notes from a course on home buying and told her to help them find a permanent place to live. In 1975, Wendy found a listing for 137 West 122nd Street in The New York Times\u2014a house designed by the architect Francis H. Kimball, with original woodwork, stained-glass windows, and five original gas-burning fireplaces. Jo walked through the doors and knew she was home. When she tried to apply for a loan, the loan officer at Citibank (known at the time as First National City Bank) admitted that the bank did not lend mortgages in Harlem. So Jo persuaded the seller to agree to a purchase-money mortgage instead, essentially taking out a loan straight from the seller instead of a bank. Jo even agreed to cover the seller\u2019s property taxes for that quarter after the owner wavered on the decision to sell. All of this took place even after redlining had been officially outlawed in 1968, with the passing of the Fair Housing Act. During redlining, the Federal Housing Administration, which insured private mortgages, considered whether black people lived in a particular neighborhood when making its insurance decisions. In \u201cThe Case for Reparations,\u201d Ta-Nehisi Coates writes, \u201cNeither the percentage of black people living there nor their social class mattered.\u201d Black people were denied traditional mortgages. White families bought homes, moved to the suburbs, and gained equity, while black families were largely prevented from increasing their wealth through homeownership. By 1970, black people made up 92.2 percent of central-Harlem residents. Jo established a spring cleaning to rid the neighborhood of debris, and later led a task force to rid the neighborhood of drugs. She fought to register her house\u2014which became part of a historic district\u2014on the National Register of Historic Places in order to secure the only loan she could get. (A spokesman for Citibank said it does not keep records of its lending practices going that far back but is committed to fair lending practices.) Jo\u2019s tenacity brought her many things, but financial security wasn\u2019t one of them. In 1984, Jo alleged she was forced out of her job because of her age. With advice from her former boss (having a person in your corner who is comfortable challenging authority helps), Jo filed a lawsuit against her former employer, which was settled out of court. Jo was also offered only half the severance of employees in other departments.The loan had helped her repair the exterior of the historic house, but the interior was still not yet restored when Jo left her other job, in 1989. When Jo got sick in 2006 she couldn\u2019t safely stay in the house. Her pension from work was half of what she got from Social Security, and was not enough to cover the cost of care. Jo\u2019s job as a cook came with long hours and zero benefits. She was employed for five years as a domestic worker without being eligible for Social Security: When Social Security was created in 1935, agricultural and domestic workers were excluded, causing 65 percent of African Americans to be denied benefits. Social Security encompassed multiple programs, at least some of which were explicitly created to hurt black people. While drafting Title I (a program administered by the state to elderly in need) of the Social Security Act, southern members of Congress \u201cdid not want to give authority to anyone in Washington to deny aid to any state because it discriminated against Negroes in the administration of old age assistance,\u201d Edwin Witte, the executive director of Roosevelt\u2019s economic-security committee, wrote in his memoir. Toward the end of her life, Jo had no assets beyond her partially restored home. Wendy sold the home in 2008 after moving her mother to New Jersey, closer to where Wendy lived with her partner and son. Wendy and Jo split the proceeds from the sale, with half going toward Jo\u2019s medical and assisted-living bills, Wendy told me. Then, Wendy\u2019s partner lost his job, and her half of the house money was almost all they had left to live on. \u201cEven when you get a windfall, it\u2019s not like you can invest it, because you have to make sure everything doesn\u2019t fall apart on your day-to-day life,\u201d Wendy said. Wendy\u2019s windfall\u2014half of the $1.4 million the house sold for\u2014was more than most families, black or white, will receive at any one point in their lifetime. The more telling number, though, is what Wendy chose to give up. When I asked Wendy for details of the sale, she unveiled a striking detail: Despite the house being in what is now one of the most desirable markets for Manhattan\u2019s single-family homes, Wendy chose not to list 137 West 122nd Street on the open market. As her mother\u2019s legal guardian, Wendy knew that Jo would have wanted a black family to own the home, and Jo\u2019s neighbors had offered to pay the appraisal price. For high-priced New York real-estate assets, a seller may get significantly more than the appraisal price on the open market. Wendy\u2019s decision is not surprising to me: Because homeownership was denied to many black families for decades, something larger than money is at stake when it comes to selling a home. Jo\u2019s lifelong quest was to build up the black community around her; letting the market decide the next occupant of the home would have been to put the power back into the hands of the invisible policy makers whose legacy of redlining had left her without a mortgage in 1975. Wendy\u2019s decision was characteristic of black philanthropy in general: tangible, specific, and focused on immediate impact. Philanthropy in the black community has a long history of building wealth for the group at the expense of the individual, even if that doesn\u2019t maximize one\u2019s tax advantages. Starting in 1969, in a memorable example, members of the Black Panther Party fed thousands of children free breakfast before school, hoping to keep kids full so that their minds were free to learn. The program helped form the basis of a federal food program in schools. Instead of tax breaks, members of the party were beaten and killed. A more congenial example comes from David Bennett, the vice president of development and alumni relations at Howard University in Washington, D.C., one of the nation\u2019s HBCUs. The Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, recently donated $100,000 to the school, he told me. In order to donate the money, churchgoers gave up eating out, buying coffee, and going to the movies for 21 days. The funds, Bennett said, helped 34 students, who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford tuition, graduate. HBCUs continue to carry a heavy burden to educate the black community: Howard graduates more African American students who go on to pursue science and engineering doctorates than Harvard, MIT, and Yale combined. Yet, according to a Wall Street Journal report analyzing 2017 data, HBCU graduates have a median debt that\u2019s more than 30 percent higher than that of graduates at other public and nonprofit four-year schools. Parents of HBCU students borrowed an average of roughly $14,000 in federal student loans to help pay for the 2017\u201318 academic year. The neighbors to whom Wendy sold the house kept it for 10 years, but, she said, weren\u2019t able to make the necessary renovations to rent it out. Wendy sees the house as an effort geared toward building intergenerational wealth. \u201cNow, at least, the family has the funds for the education of their young people,\u201d Wendy emailed me. \u201cSo, indirectly, my mother helped another black family have wealth to pass on, and their children will go on to do good in the world and help others.\u201d The house sold in 2018 for $2.2 million. Derrick Darby is the first and only black tenured professor in the University of Michigan\u2019s philosophy department. I first learned of Darby after reading a profile of his department chair, Elizabeth Anderson, in The New Yorker. Anderson is known for arriving at moral theory by thinking about how the world actually works. She said Darby was recruited to Michigan because his work fits that mold, allowing people to connect normative issues with the realities of contemporary injustice. I went to Ann Arbor to talk with Darby about the practical realities of policy proposals such as reparations or a wealth tax. What I found was evidence of why Darby is very much the exception, rather than the rule, in the false meritocracy of a nation founded by slaveholders. Darby\u2019s journey is rife with the often overlooked details of everyday life that shape the nuances of wealth in America. Darby grew up in New York City\u2019s Queensbridge Houses, a public-housing development that is now the largest in the country. It has birthed some of the greatest hip-hop artists of our time, such as Nas and Mobb Deep. Success for Darby was never about a number in his bank account. It was about getting out of the projects. When Darby was growing up, he dreamed of escape. \u201cI used to think about being a superhero, because that was going to be my way out,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019d get some superpowers and I could be strong \u2026 I could help my mother.\u201d Darby talked about trying out different exit routes. Basketball? No, he wasn\u2019t going to be in the NBA. Boxing? He got punched, instantly had a splitting headache, took off his gloves, and walked away. But Darby was inquisitive; he hung out with older kids and a group of ex-convicts in the neighborhood. They used to call him \u201cLittle Socrates.\u201d It was the ex-convicts, people Darby looked up to because they made it clear that their path was not the only path, who told him to focus on knowledge as a means of escape. He just as easily, however, could have absorbed another message. Despite being labeled by a teacher as a good student in the third grade, Darby was suddenly considered a problem in the fourth. Darby remembers changing his little sister\u2019s diapers before going to school. The cycle of being saddled with child-care responsibilities and being punished for not doing well in school took its toll, and he struggled to stay focused on his education. Making it past fourth grade proved crucial: Subsequent teachers reinforced his third-grade teacher\u2019s message and invested in Darby, buoying his path through high school and, along with a guidance counselor, helping him with college applications until he was accepted to Colgate University. Once at Colgate, his philosophy professor latched onto his talent and encouraged him to pursue his doctorate. When Darby talked about policies such as universal child care, he said they\u2019re not just about helping parents. Policies such as that would help alleviate the responsibilities that can fall on children when families are strapped for resources. Academia still plays mostly by the old rule books. Scholars are comfortable citing traditionalists. Try asking \u201cWhat is injustice?\u201d instead of \u201cWhat is justice?\u201d in philosophy, Darby said, and you\u2019re viewed as breaking from custom. Philosophy represents the type of discipline where the system may still not be built to accommodate the diversity it claims to want. \u201cOn the one hand, because of the recent push for diversity in the discipline black philosophers are novelties; yet on the other hand, their race threatens the white male homogeneity that has traditionally characterized the discipline,\u201d writes Jameliah Shorter-Bourhanou, an assistant professor of philosophy at Georgia College. Quayshawn Spencer, a philosophy professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says that 66 percent of tenured or tenure-track black philosophers are the only black philosophers in their department, according to 2013 data. Michigan will soon go back to having zero tenured black professors: Darby has accepted an offer from Rutgers University to be the Henry Rutgers Professor of Philosophy and direct the soon-to-be-created Social Justice Solutions Research Collaboratory. Philosophers are known more as thinkers than as earners. With Darby\u2019s new position, however, the two may coincide: He will be joining one of the top philosophy departments in the country. Darby\u2019s trajectory may not have begun with the explicit goal of building monetary wealth. Rather, it was important for him to do what he loved and build wealth along the way. Both of those opportunities were nearly taken from him when he was up for tenure at another university. Darby showed me a letter from a colleague in the philosophy department, detailing why the university should deny Darby tenure. (I reached out several times to the professor who wrote the letter for comment, but did not receive a response. The university declined to comment.) The letter questioned his ability to teach graduate students and suggested that many scholars who reviewed his research were biased. \u201cIt was an attack on me,\u201d Darby said. He believes the letter partially meant to suggest that any support he had within the university and beyond was driven by racial sympathy, instead of the strength of his ideas. The professor titled it \u201cDepartment Minority Report,\u201d a typical name for a dissenting document that goes against the committee\u2019s majority vote, but perhaps a cruel reminder when you are one of the few people of color among your colleagues. At the end of the review process, Darby was denied tenure. Darby filed an appeal and later learned the contents of the letter. He also hired a lawyer out of his own pocket, no small thing on his entry-level academic salary. A ruling conceded that there had been \u201cunusual procedures\u201d and offered Darby another chance to be reviewed. But Darby declined, and instead accepted a position elsewhere. \u201cAt the time, it was really difficult, knowing that they changed the rules,\u201d Darby told me. \u201cYou climb this ladder\u2014but then, when we start climbing that ladder and we get into those spaces, the rules change.\u201d Darby knows that he is one of the lucky ones. He could see how someone who had not been in a position to challenge the tenure ruling may have ended up leaving philosophy altogether. For Darby, the system eventually worked. For others, without the right network or funds, it fails them. There is a supposed right way to be black in America: You\u2019re encouraged to live in certain neighborhoods; you must make certain sacrifices for the sake of education. When I was younger, I railed against these constraints. Money only complicated the picture. In time, I came to understand that the image money creates stands in for all the things we don\u2019t say about who gets to be free. As a child, I found refuge in my house and all it stood for. As an adult, I understand how much of my family history was wrapped up in that simple feeling. Even the black families who make it to the top are still facing the headwinds that knocked African Americans back down the path for so long. While the Americans who self-identify as \u201cmiddle class\u201d but hold the majority of the wealth in the United States\u2014\u201cthe 9.9 percent,\u201d in Matthew Stewart\u2019s memorable phrase\u2014debate private versus public school or whether to remodel their kitchen, upwardly mobile black families continue to overcome a history of oppression with their eyes toward wealth as a reconciliation of the freedom long denied. \u201cMaking it\u201d is not merely an end point. It is so much more than that. Wealth has become an animating issue in the 2020 presidential election. Take Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposal for a wealth tax. Under Warren\u2019s plan, according to an analysis by the UC Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the wealthiest 75,000 households in the United States would be subject to payments of 2 percent of their net worth above $50 million and 3 percent of their net worth above $1 billion every year. Warren says the resulting revenue would be enough to cover her proposal to cancel student-loan debt for 42 million Americans and provide a free public-college education. (She would also provide funding for HBCUs.) The wealth tax represents a step toward federal recognition that people don\u2019t succeed on their own. But her proposal, and those like it, hint at the symptoms, not the cause. They do not address the fact that once you graduate from college and land a job, your wealth is still in the hands of others (your boss or even a colleague, as the case may be). Or that if you don\u2019t wish to go to college and instead want to pursue a bold business idea, your freedom to do so depends on your parents\u2019 ability to support you. This means different things for black and white Americans. Put another way: Believe for a moment that the world\u2019s Googles and Amazons had been invented in garages, as their founding myths assert. Would companies like that exist if failure meant living in the projects instead of a middle-class garage? What we need is a formal reconciliation with the way wealth is built and maintained. To put the freedom of choice created through wealth back into the hands of the people who have had that freedom denied to them for far too long. How do we do that? I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s an easy answer. Read: The racial wealth gap could become a 2020 litmus test Arguably the most important act of reconciliation took place at a college graduation in Atlanta this spring. Robert F. Smith, an investor and the wealthiest black person in the United States, said he would pay off the student-loan debt of the graduating class at Morehouse College, an HBCU. Smith told the graduates, \u201cTrue wealth comes from contributing to the liberation of people, and the liberation of communities we come from depends upon the grit and the determination and the greatness inside of you.\u201d What struck me about Smith\u2019s gift, compared with other philanthropic efforts or policy arguments, was this: He put the power of choice back into the graduates\u2019 hands by acknowledging the shared history of African Americans. I grew up with the freedom to choose because my family overcame incredible odds. In fact, maybe I have that freedom only because they dared not to follow a conventional path. It is this friction that was difficult for me to come to terms with: The right to pursue a passion and build wealth seems to be reserved for a select few. Maybe no one has the right to do both. But you\u2019re less likely to have to choose if the generation that came before you was wealthy, and less likely still if that generation was white. Closing the wealth gap sounds like an abstract policy agenda, but it\u2019s really about giving more people the power to choose how to care for themselves and their families. The individuals I spoke with know this responsibility intimately. But black wealth is not separate from American wealth\u2014it is the definition of American wealth. Everyone who shares in this country\u2019s wealth also has the responsibility to lift others up. There is no such thing as an individual success story. * Photo-collage images courtesy of Maura Cheeks, Wendy Jones, Derrick Darby, John Swart / Beth A. Keiser / SJP / AP.

For a time, our family\u2019s safety net was held together by my grandfather\u2019s HVAC business, but in 2001, it nearly came apart. That year, the company worked on a project performing mechanical-contracting work at Lincoln Financial Field, the home of the Philadelphia Eagles. The timeline did not account for delays. My grandfather estimates that the company lost $4 million on the project. Our house was put on the market shortly after. I loved that house because it felt like home, but also because it made me feel at home in a predominantly white world, where I felt as if my every move was on display. The house served as a symbol of wealth to justify belonging. When we sold it, I felt exposed, as though my family was showcasing the fragility of black wealth for all to see.\n\nWhen we sold it, I felt exposed, as though my family was showcasing the fragility of black wealth for all to see. I told friends that my family wanted to downsize. I\u2019m sure they saw through the lie. Americans are uncomfortable talking about money. We use careers, homes, and clothing to stand in as proxies.

My own understanding was rooted in the idea that while my family represented a version of the American dream, the injustices that have kept black families without a safety net for generations still reverberated throughout our history.\n\nA raft of policies responsible for building the American middle class destroyed opportunities for black people to build intergenerational wealth. According to 2013 data from a paper by the progressive think tank Institute for Policy Studies, if the average wealth held by white families magically stopped growing, it would take 228 years for the average wealth held by African Americans to catch up. When researchers from the institute looked at median wealth from 1983 to 2016 (adjusting for inflation), black families saw their wealth decrease by more than half, while white families saw theirs rise by 33 percent. While white families have a median wealth of $171,000, black families have a median wealth of just $17,600.\n\nThese relationships aren\u2019t fixed. Once you get a certain amount of wealth, keeping it within your family is much easier. It took until 1976 for the government to introduce the generation-skipping transfer tax, which was instituted to stop individuals from avoiding federal estate taxes by leaving money to their grandchildren. \n\nAmerica\u2019s tax system protects the wealth that already exists, instead of the wealth that might exist if more families were in a position to build it. That my grandfather built enough wealth to get us into that house but not enough to keep it is partially a result of how much the cards have been stacked against African American wealth-building for generations.\n\nWhen World War II ended, my grandfather was only 6, but the discriminatory distortions of the GI Bill are still visible in our family\u2019s financial history. His father, aunt, and uncles were World War II veterans. Four of them were able to secure coveted government jobs. \n\nWhite veterans, however, were encouraged to go to college, where they graduated with degrees in subjects such as engineering. Even though 49 percent of black veterans (compared with 43 percent of white veterans) took advantage of some sort of education or training offered through GI Bill benefits as of 1950, that didn\u2019t always mean a college degree.\n\nMy grandfather joined a union in 1956. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Act into law, policy makers drafted it to exclude agricultural and domestic workers, so black people made up less than 1 percent of union members. Black workers continued to struggle for equal treatment in unions: 31 affiliates of the American Federation of Labor explicitly excluded black workers at one point.\n\nMembership was nonetheless an important stepping stone for my grandfather. He gained entry only after his grandmother, a maid, persuaded her boss, the entrepreneur Charlie Willard, to hire her grandson. \n\nHe got assigned to run the crew for Pennsylvania Hospital\u2019s first professionally air-conditioned building. As my grandfather tells it, the hospital quickly poached him, offering him a full-time job and eventually promoting him to a position with a salary of $35,000. Eventually my grandfather wanted more than a steady paycheck.\n\nAlthough he may not have thought about it at the time, he wanted to build wealth. So he started a side hustle installing air conditioners for restaurants, bars, and colleges. He branded white trucks with his name and hired a crew to help him fulfill orders while he was at the hospital.\n\nWhen the hospital discovered his other business, his boss gave him an ultimatum: his side hustle or his full-time job. He chose the side hustle. He recalls union companies early on working with their friends to secure low prices from suppliers, blocking him from getting projects.\n\nMy grandfather\u2019s story is one of success (this year his business turns 50) that also illustrates why black success is used to claim that the playing field in America is more level than it actually is. My grandfather made it, but does his success against all odds mean that it\u2019s okay when everyone else faces those same odds and fails?\n\nSelling our home served as a personal paradigm shift. Whereas before I felt confident of my place in the world and my ability to keep climbing, afterward I felt my risk tolerance crumbling. I began to see my family\u2019s story in the context of a larger history of a system that unfairly advantages white families at the expense of black ones.\n\nSo I went to college and studied practical subjects instead of pursuing a passion. I landed jobs after college meant to build wealth, instead of pursuing writing or jobs in publishing, industries that privilege the children of wealthy families who can afford to subsidize young workers in low-paying entry-level jobs.\n\nMy family, despite their struggles, gave me the means to choose differently. Even so, my initial choices highlight the complicated nature of black success: It\u2019s knowing that as you rise, you have a responsibility to make sure your family and community rise with you.\n\nFor better or worse, American wealth is a family affair. Part of what I struggled with growing up is that my dad\u2019s profession is the archetype of black wealth and success. \n\nI remember overhearing a classmate once saying something along the lines of \u201cRich black people play sports.\u201d This idea about what professional sports means conflicted with the reality of a limited generational safety net.\n\nMy dad still works in the NBA, coaching for Oklahoma City. He guards his emotions as well as he used to guard other players, and I recently flew there hesitant to have a frank conversation about money and, more specifically, what it was like for him to go from the South Side of Chicago to a world of success.\n\nWe sat in the living room, his dog, Bailey, lying by his side, the television muted in the background. It was a high-pressure time in the season, and I was nervous that he wouldn\u2019t want to delve into the past.\n\nBut as he did, I came to understand how inaccurate it is to assume that people deemed worthy as \u201cmaking it\u201d step into one world while leaving behind their own personal history.\n\nMaurice Cheeks grew up in Chicago\u2019s Robert Taylor Homes, once the largest public-housing development in the country; it\u2019s now gone\u2014the last building was torn down in 2007.\n\nThe development opened in 1962, housing up to 27,000 people despite being planned to hold less than half of that. By 1975, 92 percent of the families relied on government assistance.\n\nMy dad\u2019s general feeling was that you lived your life as best you could. \u201cIt was rough,\u201d my dad told me. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t really think about it at the time.\u201d\n\nMy dad will be the first to say that he did not make it out on his own. His basketball career started because a friend won a basketball scholarship to West Texas State (now West Texas A&M University) and told the coach that he would accept only if the coach also took my dad.\n\nIn 1978, my dad was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with a starting salary of $30,000. Today that income would be worth roughly $123,000, or just less than the mean salary for a pharmacist.\n\nMy dad was making money, but at a salary that did not go as far as the public perception of professional sports portrays.\n\nOne cannot talk about closing the wealth gap in any meaningful way without acknowledging that middle- and upper-class black families have lost and are still losing wealth because African Americans were ushered into segregated neighborhoods and denied the same benefits extended to white Americans.\n\nAs soon as my dad started earning a salary, he sent much of it back to my grandmother, who continued living in the Robert Taylor Homes when he first started playing in the NBA.\n\nResearch shows that my dad\u2019s experience is typical for black people who have family members in need.\n\nThe Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the world\u2019s longest-running longitudinal household survey, began in 1968 with 18,233 people, and now spans four generations or more.\n\nAccording to data from the 1994 PSID analyzed by Darrick Hamilton from the Ohio State University and Ngina Chiteji, now at New York University, 36 percent of middle-income black families\u2019 parents lived in poverty, compared with 8 percent of middle-income white families\u2019 parents.\n\nWhen Hamilton, Jermaine Toney (a National Science Foundation postdoctoral research fellow at Cornell University), and William A. Darity Jr. analyzed 2013 PSID data, they found that the parents of middle-income black families were more than eight times as likely to face poverty as the parents of middle-income white families.\n\nThe mean net worth of black grandparents in the sample amounted to $56,713\u2014for white grandparents it was $357,831.\n\nThose family ties may add up to an unending drain on the financial resources of anyone who makes it.\n\nHamilton and Chiteji found that family circumstances, in general, are responsible for middle-class black families having 27 percent less wealth than their white counterparts.\n\nHamilton and Darity wrote, \u201cInheritance, bequests, and in vivo transfer account for more of the racial wealth gap than any other behavioral, demographic, or socioeconomic indicator.\u201d\n\nIn other words, most people at the top of the wealth ladder are not there because of grit. More likely, the government or a family member helped lift them up\u2014by paying for their education, or giving them a loan, or helping with rent.\n\nWealth doesn\u2019t just add lift. It ensures that when you fall, you land softly.\n\nThe economist Raj Chetty and three other researchers found that a black child born to parents whose income is in the top quintile has roughly the same likelihood of falling to the bottom quintile as remaining at the top. White children, however, are about five times as likely to stay at the top when born there than they are to drop to the bottom.\n\nCritics will argue that people who don\u2019t climb upward when receiving help from welfare programs are taking advantage of the system. Welfare programs, however, are not one size fits all. Each program is intricately woven with the biases of policy makers, and rarely helps families build long-term wealth.\n\nWendy Jones\u2019s mother, Josephine E. Jones, may have been the first black woman in management at a Fortune 500 company. \n\nJo established a spring cleaning to rid the neighborhood of debris, and later led a task force to rid the neighborhood of drugs. She fought to register her house\u2014which became part of a historic district\u2014on the National Register of Historic Places in order to secure the only loan she could get.\n\nJo\u2019s tenacity brought her many things, but financial security wasn\u2019t one of them. In 1984, Jo alleged she was forced out of her job because of her age. With advice from her former boss (having a person in your corner who is comfortable challenging authority helps), Jo filed a lawsuit against her former employer, which was settled out of court.\n\nJo was also offered only half the severance of employees in other departments.\n\nThe loan had helped her repair the exterior of the historic house, but the interior was still not yet restored when Jo left her other job, in 1989.\n\nWhen Jo got sick in 2006 she couldn\u2019t safely stay in the house. Her pension from work was half of what she got from Social Security, and was not enough to cover the cost of care.\n\nJo\u2019s job as a cook came with long hours and zero benefits. She was employed for five years as a domestic worker without being eligible for Social Security: When Social Security was created in 1935, agricultural and domestic workers were excluded, causing 65 percent of African Americans to be denied benefits.\n\nWendy sold the home in 2008 after moving her mother to New Jersey, closer to where Wendy lived with her partner and son. Wendy and Jo split the proceeds from the sale, with half going toward Jo\u2019s medical and assisted-living bills.\n\nWendy\u2019s decision is not surprising to me: Because homeownership was denied to many black families for decades, something larger than money is at stake when it comes to selling a home.\n\nPhilanthropy in the black community has a long history of building wealth for the group at the expense of the individual, even if that doesn\u2019t maximize one\u2019s tax advantages.\n\nStarting in 1969, in a memorable example, members of the Black Panther Party fed thousands of children free breakfast before school, hoping to keep kids full so that their minds were free to learn.\n\nThe Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, recently donated $100,000 to the school, he told me. In order to donate the money, churchgoers gave up eating out, buying coffee, and going to the movies for 21 days.\n\nDerrick Darby grew up in New York City\u2019s Queensbridge Houses, a public-housing development that is now the largest in the country.\n\nSuccess for Darby was never about a number in his bank account. It was about getting out of the projects.\n\nDarby talked about trying out different exit routes. Basketball? No, he wasn\u2019t going to be in the NBA. Boxing? He got punched, instantly had a splitting headache, took off his gloves, and walked away.\n\nBut Darby was inquisitive; he hung out with older kids and a group of ex-convicts in the neighborhood. They used to call him \u201cLittle Socrates.\u201d\n\nDespite being labeled by a teacher as a good student in the third grade, Darby was suddenly considered a problem in the fourth.\n\nMaking it past fourth grade proved crucial: Subsequent teachers reinforced his third-grade teacher\u2019s message and invested in Darby, buoying his path through high school and, along with a guidance counselor, helping him with college applications until he was accepted to Colgate University.\n\nOnce at Colgate, his philosophy professor latched onto his talent and encouraged him to pursue his doctorate.\n\nWhen Darby talked about policies such as universal child care, he said they\u2019re not just about helping parents. Policies such as that would help alleviate the responsibilities that can fall on children when families are strapped for resources.\n\nAcademia still plays mostly by the old rule books. Scholars are comfortable citing traditionalists. Try asking \u201cWhat is injustice?\u201d instead of \u201cWhat is justice?\u201d in philosophy, \n\nPhilosophers are known more as thinkers than as earners. With Darby\u2019s new position, however, the two may coincide: He will be joining one of the top philosophy departments in the country.\n\nWealth has become an animating issue in the 2020 presidential election. Take Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposal for a wealth tax.\n\nThe wealth tax represents a step toward federal recognition that people don\u2019t succeed on their own.\n\nWhat we need is a formal reconciliation with the way wealth is built and maintained. To put the freedom of choice created through wealth back into the hands of the people who have had that freedom denied to them for far too long.\n\nArguably the most important act of reconciliation took place at a college graduation in Atlanta this spring. Robert F. Smith, an investor and the wealthiest black person in the United States, said he would pay off the student-loan debt of the graduating class at Morehouse College, an HBCU.\n\nSmith told the graduates, \u201cTrue wealth comes from contributing to the liberation of people, and the liberation of communities we come from depends upon the grit and the determination and the greatness inside of you.\u201d\n\nClosing the wealth gap sounds like an abstract policy agenda, but it\u2019s really about giving more people the power to choose how to care for themselves and their families.\n\nThe individuals I spoke with know this responsibility intimately. But black wealth is not separate from American wealth\u2014it is the definition of American wealth. Everyone who shares in this country\u2019s wealth also has the responsibility to lift others up. There is no such thing as an individual success story.",

    "text": "  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 The gap between the haves and have-nots in the United States grew last year to its highest level in more than 50 years of tracking income inequality, according to Census Bureau figures. Income inequality in the United States expanded from 2017 to 2018, with several heartland states among the leaders of the increase, even though several wealthy coastal states still had the most inequality overall, according to figures released Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau. The nation's Gini Index, which measures income inequality, has been rising steadily over the past five decades. The Gini Index grew from 0.482 in 2017 to 0.485 last year, according to the bureau's 1-year American Community Survey data. The Gini Index is on a scale of 0 to 1; a score of \"0'' indicates perfect equality, while a score of \"1'' indicates perfect inequality, where one household has all the income. The increase in income inequality comes as two Democratic presidential candidates, U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, are pitching a \"wealth tax\" on the nation's richest citizens as a way to reduce wealth disparities. The inequality expansion last year took place at the same time median household income nationwide increased to almost $62,000 last year, the highest ever measured by the American Community Survey. But the 0.8% income increase from 2017 to 2018 was much smaller compared to increases in the previous three years, according to the bureau. Even though household income increased, it was distributed unevenly, with the wealthiest helped out possibly by a tax cut passed by Congress in 2017, said Hector Sandoval, an economist at the University of Florida. \"In 2018 the unemployment rate was already low, and the labor market was getting tight, resulting in higher wages. This can explain the increase in the median household income,\" Sandoval said. \"However, the increase in the Gini index shows that the distribution became more unequal. That is, top income earners got even larger increases in their income, and one of the reasons for that might well be the tax cut.\" A big factor in the increase in inequality has to do with two large population groups on either end of the economic spectrum, according to Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida. On one side, at the peak of their earnings, are baby boomers who are nearing retirement, if they haven't already retired. On the other side are millennials and Gen Z-ers, who are in the early stages of their work life and have lower salaries, Snaith said. \"I would say probably the biggest factor is demographics,\" he said. \"A wealth tax isn't going to fix demographics.\" The area's with the most income inequality last year were coastal places with large amounts of wealth \u2014 the District of Columbia, New York and Connecticut, as well as areas with great poverty \u2014 Puerto Rico and Louisiana. Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota had the most economic equality. Three of the states with biggest gains in inequality from 2017 to 2018 were places with large pockets of wealth \u2014 California, Texas and Virginia. But the other six states were primarily in the heartland \u2014 Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire and New Mexico. A variety of factors were at play, from a slowdown in agricultural trade and manufacturing to wages that haven't caught up with other forms of income, economists say. While some states have raised the minimum wage, other states like Kansas haven't. At the same time, the sustained economic growth from the recession a decade ago has enriched people who own stocks, property and other assets, and have sources of income other than wages, said Donna Ginther, an economist at the University of Kansas. \"We've had a period of sustained economic growth, and there are winners and losers. The winners tend to be at the top,\" Ginther said. \"Even though we are at full employment, wages really haven't gone up much in the recovery.\" \u00a9\u00a02025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

    "text": "November 1, 2018 12 min read How Economic Inequality Inflicts Real Biological Harm The growing gulf between rich and poor inflicts biological damage on bodies and brains By Robert M. Sapolsky  Andrea Ucini Western cultures have long cherished the notion that all people are created equal. But in the real world, our lives are not balanced with equal opportunities and resources. This distinction was noted mordantly in 1894 by author Anatole France, who wrote that \u201cthe law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.\u201d The rich, of course, need none of these things, whereas the poor often have little choice. And economic disparity has only gotten worse during the past several decades, particularly in the U.S. In 1976 the richest 1 percent of U.S. citizens owned 9 percent of the country\u2019s wealth; today they own about 30 percent. This trend echoes around the globe. One of the consequences for the growing poor is worsening health, and the reasons are not as obvious as you might think. Yes, lower socioeconomic status (SES) means less access to health care and living in more disease-prone neighborhoods. And, yes, as the SES ladder\u2019s lower rungs have become more populated, the number of people with medical problems has climbed. This is not merely an issue of poor health for the poor and some version of better health for everyone else. Starting with Elon Musk at the top, every step down the ladder is associated with worse health. The link between socioeconomic inequality and poor health goes beyond simple access to care and living with more dangers. Fewer than half of the health changes along this SES/health ladder can be explained away by risks such as smoking, alcohol consumption and reliance on fast food or by protective factors such as insurance and health club memberships. In the U.K., large, long-term studies of risks in specific groups, led by epidemiologist Michael Marmot and called the Whitehall studies, demonstrated this clearly. Further, this ladder, or gradient, exists in nations with universal health care; if care availability were truly responsible, universal access should make the gradient vanish. Something else, something quite powerful, must be associated with inequities and be able to cause health problems.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. That factor seems to be the stressful psychosocial consequences of low SES. Psychologist Nancy Adler of the University of California, San Francisco, and her colleagues have demonstrated that how people rate how they are doing, relative to others, is at least as predictive of health or illness as are any objective measures such as actual income level. The research indicates that poor health is as much about feeling poor as being poor. Epidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett of the University of Nottingham and the University of York in England, respectively, have filled out this picture in detail, showing that while poverty is bad for your health, poverty amid plenty\u2014inequality\u2014can be worse by just about any measure: infant mortality, overall life expectancy, obesity, murder rates, and more. Health is particularly corroded by your nose constantly being rubbed in what you do not have. Basically, more unequal societies have worse quality of life. Across countries and among U.S. states, more inequality, independent of absolute levels of income, predicts higher rates of crime, including homicide, and higher incarceration rates. Add in higher rates of kids being bullied at schools, more teen pregnancies and lower literacy. There are more psychiatric problems, alcoholism and drug use, as well as lower levels of happiness and less social mobility. And there is less social support\u2014a steep hierarchy is the antithesis of the equality and symmetry that nourish friendship. This grim collective picture helps to explain the immensely important fact that when inequality increases, everyone\u2019s health suffers. This is where the problem affects the rich, the haves, as well as the have-nots. With increasing inequality, they typically expend more resources insulating themselves from the world underneath the bridges. I have heard economist Robert Evans of the University of British Columbia call this the \u201csecession of the wealthy.\u201d They spend more of their own resources on gated communities, private schools, bottled water and expensive organic food. And they give lots of money to politicians who help them maintain their status. It is stressful to construct thick walls to keep everything stressful out. Knowing that these psychological and social factors influence the biology of disease is one thing. Demonstrating just how these stressors do their dirty work inside the body is something else. How do SES and inequality \u201cget under the skin\u201d? It turns out that researchers have made significant strides toward an answer. We have learned a lot about how poverty affects biology, and the part of the growing inequality gap that worries people is the poverty end. Scientists have been able to trace physiological connections from external inequality to three key inner areas: chronic inflammation, chromosomal aging and brain function. Thinking about the biology of disease was revolutionized in the 1990s, when the late Bruce McEwen of the Rockefeller University introduced the concept of allostatic load. Our bodies are constantly challenged by our environment, and we stay healthy when we meet those challenges and return to a baseline state, or homeostasis. Traditionally this view led scientists to focus on specific organs that solve specific challenges. Allostasis has a different perspective: physiological challenges provoke far-flung adaptations throughout the body. An infected toe, for instance, will produce not only inflammation at the tip of the foot but also wider changes in everything from energy taken from abdominal fat to the brain chemistry of sleepiness. As this biological grind continues, it leads to an array of body parts functioning less than optimally, which can be as damaging to health as a single organ gone very wrong. Teresa Seeman of the University of California, Los Angeles, took this idea and followed it through the body, measuring various biomarkers of wear and tear, including increases in blood pressure, cholesterol, blood lipids, body mass index, molecular indicators of chronic hyperglycemia, and levels of stress hormones. She showed that this group of disparate measures powerfully predicts physical health and mortality. Recent research by Seeman and others links low SES with heavy allostatic load because the body is in a constant and futile battle to return to a normal, nonstressed state. These findings highlight an important theme: whereas an adult\u2019s SES predicts allostatic wear and tear, childhood SES leaves a stronger lifelong mark. Low SES predisposes youngsters\u2019 bodies toward earlier \u201caging.\u201d The scientists also found protective factors. Although growing up in an impoverished neighborhood worsens the low SES\u2013allostatic load link, lucking out with a mother who has the time and energy to be highly nurturing reduces the ill effects. Credit: Bryan Christie Design Stress in any form can produce these effects. It does not have to be related to money, but it is usually related to social situations. My own work with baboons living freely on the East African savanna has shown this effect. In baboon groups, an animal\u2019s place in the social hierarchy produces more or less stress. If you are a low-ranking baboon\u2014a socially stressful situation\u2014your body has unhealthy abnormalities in its secretion of glucocorticoids, which are stress hormones such as cortisol. The body also shows unhealthy changes in the gonadal, cardiovascular and immune systems. In animal and human hierarchies, these stress-induced changes affect health through a key process: chronic inflammation. Few things are better examples of a double-edged biological sword than inflammation. After tissue injury, inflammation contains damage and initiates cell repair. Chronic widespread inflammation, however, causes molecular damage throughout the body, and studies have demonstrated that it contributes to diseases ranging from atherosclerosis to Alzheimer\u2019s. Recent work (including my own focusing on inflammation of the nervous system) indicates that chronic high stress levels can promote chronic inflammation. In people, childhood poverty upregulates the adult body\u2019s proinflammatory set point, with increased expression of inflammatory genes and increased levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, which is associated with a higher risk of heart attacks. These are long-term effects: more financial losses in the Great Recession predict higher C-reactive protein levels six years later. Humans share such vulnerabilities with other primates that live in unequal circumstances. Work by Jenny Tung of Duke University shows more markers of chronic inflammation in low-ranking rhesus monkeys compared with the socially dominant animals in a group. Such studies highlight the directness of the link between social stress factors and unhealthy biology because that link occurs in a species that lacks changes in lifestyle risk factors, such as increased rates of smoking and drinking, that we often see in humans who are stuck in low-status situations. Progress in understanding the routes into the body taken by the SES/health gradient has also come through a very sensitive measure of aging: the condition of telomeres, which are the stretches of DNA at the very tips of chromosomes. Telomeres help to keep our chromosomes stable\u2014molecular biologists like to say that they resemble the plastic caps at the ends of shoelaces that prevent fraying. Every time chromosomes are duplicated for cell division, the telomeres shorten; when they get too short, cells can no longer divide, and they lose many of their healthy functions. Telomere shortening is countered by the enzyme telomerase, which rebuilds these tips. Thus, the state of a cell\u2019s telomeres tells much about its biological \u201cage,\u201d and shortened telomeres that produce frayed, vulnerable chromosomes seem to be a molecular version of wear and tear. Telomere biology met stress physiology in a 2004 study led by health psychologist Elissa Epel and molecular biologist Elizabeth Blackburn, then both at U.C.S.F.; Blackburn won a Nobel Prize in 2009 for her pioneering work on telomeres. They examined 39 people who lived with severe stress every day: women who were caregivers for chronically ill children. The landmark finding was that white blood cells in these caregivers had shortened telomeres, decreased telomerase activity, and elevated oxidative damage to proteins and enzymes. (Oxidation can disable telomerase.) The longer a child\u2019s illness, the more stress the women reported and the shorter their telomeres were, even after the researchers accounted for potentially confounding factors such as diet and smoking. Telomeres normally shorten at a more or less constant rate in people, and calculations showed that these women\u2019s telomeres had aged roughly an additional decade\u2014and sometimes more\u2014past those in the low-stress group. This discovery triggered a flood of supporting studies showing that stressors that include major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and the experience of racial discrimination can all accelerate telomere shortening. Unsurprisingly, lower childhood SES also predicts shorter telomeres in adulthood; perceived poor neighborhood quality, witnessing or experiencing violence, family instability (such as divorce, death or incarceration of a parent), and other features of poor status early on are tied to these shrunken chromosome tips later in life. Spend your childhood in poverty, and by middle age your telomeres will probably be about a decade older than those of people with more fortunate childhoods. Thus, from the macro level of entire body systems to the micro level of individual chromosomes, poverty finds a way to produce wear and tear. Most studies of telomere length compare \u201cpoor\u201d with \u201cnon-poor,\u201d as do the studies comparing allostatic load, but the few studies that examine the whole spectrum of inequality, step by low-status step, show that every rung down the SES ladder most likely worsens these biological markers of aging. Slipping down these rungs also changes the brain and behavior, according to a slew of recent neurobiological studies. My laboratory has devoted more than a quarter of a century to studying what ongoing stress does to the brain in rodents, monkeys and humans. Along with other labs, we have learned that one hotspot is the hippocampus, a region critical to learning and memory. Sustained stress or exposure to excessive glucocorticoids impairs memory by lowering hippocampal excitability, retracting connections between neurons and suppressing the birth of new neurons. In the amygdala, a brain area that is central to fear and anxiety, stress and glucocorticoids heighten those two reactions. Instead of damping things down as they do in the hippocampus, in this fear-promoting region they increase excitability and expand neuronal connections. Together these findings help to explain why post-traumatic stress disorder atrophies the hippocampus and enlarges the amygdala. Another affected area is the mesolimbic dopamine system, which is crucial to reward, anticipation and motivation. Chronic stress disrupts that system, and the result is a predisposition toward the anhedonia of depression and vulnerability to addiction. Bombardment by glucocorticoids also affects the prefrontal cortex (PFC), key to long-term planning, executive function and impulse control. In the PFC, social stress and elevated glucocorticoids weaken connections between neurons, making it harder for them to communicate. Myelination, the process that insulates cables between neurons and thus helps them pass signals faster, is impaired. Total cell volume in the region declines, and chronic inflammation is activated.

United Nations Development Program, 2007 (GDP per capita data) What happens when the PFC is impaired in this way? Lousy, impulsive decisions happen. Consider \u201ctemporal discounting\u201d: when choosing between an immediate reward and a bigger one if you wait, the appeal of waiting goes down as the time you have to wait goes up. The PFC is normally good at combating this shortsightedness. But stress steepens temporal discounting; the more cumulative stress, the less PFC activation in experiments that call for gratification postponement. For people sliding further into inequality, the less active PFC makes it harder for the brain to choose long-term health over immediate pleasure. That neurological effect might explain why people with more total life stress gain more weight and smoke and drink more than those with fewer stressors. These changes in the PFC happen in children, too. In separate studies, Martha Farah of the University of Pennsylvania and W. Thomas Boyce, professor emeritus at U.C.S.F., observed that lower-SES kindergartners typically have elevated glucocorticoid levels, a thinner and less active PFC, and poor PFC-dependent impulse control and executive function. These effects increase as kids get older. By adolescence, lower SES predicts smaller PFC volume. By adulthood, low SES predicts steeper temporally discounted decisions. Some of these observations present a tricky chicken-and-egg question. The brain changes could lead to poor choices, which in turn lead to deeper poverty, rather than the other way around. But the research suggests that causes and effects run in the other direction, with SES and inequality first influencing PFC function and then other bad things happening. For example, kindergartners\u2019 SES predicted their PFC function; few five-year-olds plummet into poverty by squandering their paychecks on drink and horses. Further evidence comes from a 2013 study by Jiaying Zhao of the University of British Columbia and her colleagues. They examined Indian farmers whose economic fortunes vary seasonably. As individuals\u2019 SES went from being poorest during planting season to wealthiest after harvest, improvements in PFC function followed. To me, the most important evidence comes from research in which people\u2019s sense of their SES was lowered by the design of the experiment. Afterward these individuals did heavier temporal discounting. In one 2012 study, subjects played a game of chance against one another, with differing amounts of starting resources. \u201cPoor\u201d subjects became more likely to borrow against future earnings and less attuned to helpful clues about game strategy. In another study, subjects who were prompted to imagine scenarios of financial loss (versus neutral or advantageous ones) did steeper temporal discounting in an unrelated task. In still other research, subjects were primed to imagine their financial burdens by contemplating an expensive car repair; cognitive function was unchanged in high-SES subjects but declined in poorer individuals. Why should a transient sense of lower SES induce cognitive changes typical of lower SES in the real world? One explanation is that it is a rational response because it is hard to think about squirreling away money for old age if you can barely buy groceries. Poverty makes the future a less relevant place. But there is also a powerful stress-related explanation: long-term planning and impulse control tires out the PFC. Increase subjects\u2019 cognitive \u201cload\u201d with taxing PFC-dependent tasks, and they become more likely to cheat on their diet. Or you can\u2014and scientists have done this\u2014increase cognitive load by tempting dieting subjects with snacks, and then they do worse on PFC-dependent tests. How much this represents literal \u201cdepletion\u201d of the PFC metabolically versus declining motivation is unclear. Either way, lower SES creates chronic financial worry that distracts and exhausts. It is hard to ace a psychological task of, say, subtracting a series of numbers or a more important task of reining in your drinking when you are worrying about paying your rent. One finding in the car-repair study supports this interpretation. When subjects contemplated a repair of negligible cost, low- and high-SES subjects performed equally well on cognitive tasks. Of course, we need to better understand the biological consequences of inequality and learn better ways to heal its health scars. But frankly, right now we know quite a bit. We know enough to prompt moral outrage at the situation. It is outrageous that if children are born into a disadvantaged family, they will be predisposed toward poor health by the time they start to learn the alphabet. It should not require us to measure inflammation or the length of chromosomes to prove this is wrong, but if it does, more power to this science. Robert M. Sapolsky is a professor of biological sciences, neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford University and a research associate at the National Museums of Kenya. In his laboratory work, he focuses on how stress can damage the brain and on gene therapy for the nervous system. He also studies populations of wild baboons in East Africa, trying to determine the relation between the social rank of a baboon and its health.

    "onlytext": "Western cultures have long cherished the notion that all people are created equal. But in the real world, our lives are not balanced with equal opportunities and resources. This distinction was noted mordantly in 1894 by author Anatole France, who wrote that \u201cthe law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.\u201d The rich, of course, need none of these things, whereas the poor often have little choice. And economic disparity has only gotten worse during the past several decades, particularly in the U.S. In 1976 the richest 1 percent of U.S. citizens owned 9 percent of the country\u2019s wealth; today they own about 30 percent. This trend echoes around the globe.\n\nOne of the consequences for the growing poor is worsening health, and the reasons are not as obvious as you might think. Yes, lower socioeconomic status (SES) means less access to health care and living in more disease-prone neighborhoods. And, yes, as the SES ladder\u2019s lower rungs have become more populated, the number of people with medical problems has climbed. This is not merely an issue of poor health for the poor and some version of better health for everyone else. Starting with Elon Musk at the top, every step down the ladder is associated with worse health.\n\nThe link between socioeconomic inequality and poor health goes beyond simple access to care and living with more dangers. Fewer than half of the health changes along this SES/health ladder can be explained away by risks such as smoking, alcohol consumption and reliance on fast food or by protective factors such as insurance and health club memberships. \n\nFurther, this ladder, or gradient, exists in nations with universal health care; if care availability were truly responsible, universal access should make the gradient vanish. Something else, something quite powerful, must be associated with inequities and be able to cause health problems.\n\nThat factor seems to be the stressful psychosocial consequences of low SES. Psychologist Nancy Adler of the University of California, San Francisco, and her colleagues have demonstrated that how people rate how they are doing, relative to others, is at least as predictive of health or illness as are any objective measures such as actual income level. The research indicates that poor health is as much about feeling poor as being poor.\n\nEpidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett of the University of Nottingham and the University of York in England, respectively, have filled out this picture in detail, showing that while poverty is bad for your health, poverty amid plenty\u2014inequality\u2014can be worse by just about any measure: infant mortality, overall life expectancy, obesity, murder rates, and more. Health is particularly corroded by your nose constantly being rubbed in what you do not have.\n\nBasically, more unequal societies have worse quality of life. Across countries and among U.S. states, more inequality, independent of absolute levels of income, predicts higher rates of crime, including homicide, and higher incarceration rates. Add in higher rates of kids being bullied at schools, more teen pregnancies and lower literacy. There are more psychiatric problems, alcoholism and drug use, as well as lower levels of happiness and less social mobility. And there is less social support\u2014a steep hierarchy is the antithesis of the equality and symmetry that nourish friendship.\n\nThis grim collective picture helps to explain the immensely important fact that when inequality increases, everyone\u2019s health suffers. This is where the problem affects the rich, the haves, as well as the have-nots. With increasing inequality, they typically expend more resources insulating themselves from the world underneath the bridges.\n\nI have heard economist Robert Evans of the University of British Columbia call this the \u201csecession of the wealthy.\u201d They spend more of their own resources on gated communities, private schools, bottled water and expensive organic food. And they give lots of money to politicians who help them maintain their status. It is stressful to construct thick walls to keep everything stressful out.\n\nKnowing that these psychological and social factors influence the biology of disease is one thing. Demonstrating just how these stressors do their dirty work inside the body is something else. How do SES and inequality \u201cget under the skin\u201d? It turns out that researchers have made significant strides toward an answer.\n\nWe have learned a lot about how poverty affects biology, and the part of the growing inequality gap that worries people is the poverty end. Scientists have been able to trace physiological connections from external inequality to three key inner areas: chronic inflammation, chromosomal aging and brain function.\n\nThinking about the biology of disease was revolutionized in the 1990s, when the late Bruce McEwen of the Rockefeller University introduced the concept of allostatic load. Our bodies are constantly challenged by our environment, and we stay healthy when we meet those challenges and return to a baseline state, or homeostasis.\n\nTeresa Seeman of the University of California, Los Angeles, took this idea and followed it through the body, measuring various biomarkers of wear and tear, including increases in blood pressure, cholesterol, blood lipids, body mass index, molecular indicators of chronic hyperglycemia, and levels of stress hormones. She showed that this group of disparate measures powerfully predicts physical health and mortality.\n\nRecent research by Seeman and others links low SES with heavy allostatic load because the body is in a constant and futile battle to return to a normal, nonstressed state. These findings highlight an important theme: whereas an adult\u2019s SES predicts allostatic wear and tear, childhood SES leaves a stronger lifelong mark.\n\nLow SES predisposes youngsters\u2019 bodies toward earlier \u201caging.\u201d The scientists also found protective factors. Although growing up in an impoverished neighborhood worsens the low SES\u2013allostatic load link, lucking out with a mother who has the time and energy to be highly nurturing reduces the ill effects.\n\nStress in any form can produce these effects. It does not have to be related to money, but it is usually related to social situations. My own work with baboons living freely on the East African savanna has shown this effect. In baboon groups, an animal\u2019s place in the social hierarchy produces more or less stress.\n\nIf you are a low-ranking baboon\u2014a socially stressful situation\u2014your body has unhealthy abnormalities in its secretion of glucocorticoids, which are stress hormones such as cortisol. The body also shows unhealthy changes in the gonadal, cardiovascular and immune systems.\n\nIn animal and human hierarchies, these stress-induced changes affect health through a key process: chronic inflammation.

    "text": "Move over, Herm\u00e8s and Miu Miu\u2014the newest luxury purse flying under the radar is a crinkled paper bag filled with burgers and greasy fries. The vast majority of Americans now find fast food way too expensive, dubbing it a \u201cluxury,\u201d a new report found. Of 2,000 American adults, 78% considered fast food a luxury because of its price tag, loan marketplace LendingTree found in a survey released Monday, using data from QuestionPro commissioned by ValuePenguin. Half of respondents said their own stretched financial situation made fast food feel like a luxury, and more than six in 10 said they had cut down on fast food because of rising prices. \u201cFast food often isn\u2019t this quick, cheap option anymore,\u201d LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz told Fortune over email. \u201cPeople are having sticker shock at the drive-thru, causing them to rethink how often they eat fast food.\u201d Respondents participated in the survey in early April\u2014the same time California\u2019s $20 minimum wage law for fast-food workers went into effect, causing chains like Chipotle to threaten 6%\u20137% increases in menu price. Even before the minimum wage law was enacted, consumers revolted against McDonald\u2019s $18 Big Mac meal and blasted Wendy\u2019s for its introduction of \u201cdynamic pricing\u201d in February, using AI to change menu item costs depending on the level of traffic during certain times of day. The burger chain backtracked the day after the announcement, saying it had no plans to raise prices, only provide discounts. Indeed, pinched consumers are most concerned about surge pricing, with 72% of those surveyed saying they would dine during off-hours if it meant cheaper menu items. Over half of respondents said they now cook at home if they\u2019re looking for a quick, cheap meal. Stephen Zagor, food and restaurant consultant and adjunct assistant professor of business at the Columbia Business School, told Fortune that bad attitudes toward fast-food companies are an extension of the mentality so many have about the economy. As fast-food prices continue to rise even as inflation cools, consumer sentiment is dipping: In May, it reached its lowest point in six months. \u201cWe\u2019re in this inflationary mental cycle as much as we are an inflationary reality cycle,\u201d Zagor said. But there\u2019s good news on the horizon for customers feeling dejected by the state of fast-food prices, Zagor said. Burger chains are feeling pressure to make changes. \u201cThey hear the customers\u2019 pain, and they\u2019re trying to be responsive\u2014as they well should be,\u201d he said.

    "onlytext": "Move over, Herm\u00e8s and Miu Miu\u2014the newest luxury purse flying under the radar is a crinkled paper bag filled with burgers and greasy fries. The vast majority of Americans now find fast food way too expensive, dubbing it a \u201cluxury,\u201d a new report found. Of 2,000 American adults, 78% considered fast food a luxury because of its price tag, loan marketplace LendingTree found in a survey released Monday, using data from QuestionPro commissioned by ValuePenguin. Half of respondents said their own stretched financial situation made fast food feel like a luxury, and more than six in 10 said they had cut down on fast food because of rising prices.\n\n\u201cFast food often isn\u2019t this quick, cheap option anymore,\u201d LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz told Fortune over email. \u201cPeople are having sticker shock at the drive-thru, causing them to rethink how often they eat fast food.\u201d Respondents participated in the survey in early April\u2014the same time California\u2019s $20 minimum wage law for fast-food workers went into effect, causing chains like Chipotle to threaten 6%\u20137% increases in menu price. Even before the minimum wage law was enacted, consumers revolted against McDonald\u2019s $18 Big Mac meal and blasted Wendy\u2019s for its introduction of \u201cdynamic pricing\u201d in February, using AI to change menu item costs depending on the level of traffic during certain times of day. The burger chain backtracked the day after the announcement, saying it had no plans to raise prices, only provide discounts.\n\nIndeed, pinched consumers are most concerned about surge pricing, with 72% of those surveyed saying they would dine during off-hours if it meant cheaper menu items. Over half of respondents said they now cook at home if they\u2019re looking for a quick, cheap meal. Stephen Zagor, food and restaurant consultant and adjunct assistant professor of business at the Columbia Business School, told Fortune that bad attitudes toward fast-food companies are an extension of the mentality so many have about the economy. As fast-food prices continue to rise even as inflation cools, consumer sentiment is dipping: In May, it reached its lowest point in six months. \u201cWe\u2019re in this inflationary mental cycle as much as we are an inflationary reality cycle,\u201d Zagor said.\n\nBut there\u2019s good news on the horizon for customers feeling dejected by the state of fast-food prices, Zagor said. Burger chains are feeling pressure to make changes. \u201cThey hear the customers\u2019 pain, and they\u2019re trying to be responsive\u2014as they well should be,\u201d he said. McDonald\u2019s announced last week its plans to launch a $5 meal deal of a burger or chicken sandwich, fries, a four-piece nugget, and a drink.

    "text": "ByJosie Cox, Contributor. The combined wealth of the world\u2019s richest individuals surged by $2 trillion last year\u2014three times faster than in 2023\u2014according to a new report published on the eve of the World Economic Forum, an annual meeting of billionaires, hosted in the Swiss Alps.  The report by Oxfam, an organization working to alleviate poverty and inequality around the world, found that 204 new billionaires were minted in 2024. In the U.S. alone\u2014where wealth concentration is particularly high\u2014the net worth of billionaires billowed by about $3.9 billion on average each day last year and 74 new billionaires emerged.  \u201cThe capture of our global economy by a privileged few has reached heights once considered unimaginable,\u201d said Oxfam International Executive Director Amitabh Behar. \u201cThe failure to stop billionaires is now spawning soon-to-be trillionaires. Not only has the rate of billionaire wealth accumulation accelerated\u2014by three times\u2014but so too has their power,\u201d he added.  Oxfam noted that the power of billionaires will be on particular display not just at the Davos WEF this week but also in Washington D.C, where Donald Trump will on Monday begin his second presidential term.  According to Oxfam, Trump\u2019s team will be the richest ever to run the U.S. government, worth more than an estimated $450 billion. So far, at least 13 billionaires have been appointed to jobs in his administration, Oxfam concluded, and even excluding Elon Musk, who reportedly spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump win November's election, the cabinet would be the richest in history.  Musk, currently has an estimated net worth of around $427 billion, making him the richest individual on the planet, followed by Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, at around $237 billion, and Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, at around $211 billion. All three are expected to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration. According to Forbes, Trump\u2019s net worth grew from about $2.5 billion to an estimated $6.1 billion during the course of 2024, thanks in part to his majority stake in Truth Social\u2019s parent company.  \u201cWe present this report as a stark wake up-call that ordinary people the world over are being crushed by the enormous wealth of a tiny few,\u201d Behar said.  Oxfam\u2019s research also found that more than a third of billionaire wealth is now inherited. Last year, a report by investment bank UBS about the super-rich, found that over the previous decade, multigenerational billionaires had inherited a total of $1.3 trillion.  \u201cThe ultra-rich like to tell us that getting rich takes skill, grit and hard work. But the truth is most wealth is taken, not made,\u201d said Behar. \u201cSo many of the so-called \u2018self-made\u2019 are actually heirs to vast fortunes, handed down through generations of unearned privilege.\u201d Earlier this month, a major survey conducted across 36 nations showed that economic inequality is now a grave public concern around the world, with many people particularly worried about the influence that the super-rich are having on policies and business decisions that exacerbate the wealth gap. The survey of more than 40,000 adults, done by the Pew Research Center last year and published in early January, found that a median of 54% of respondents across the countries said that they thought the chasm between the rich and poor was a very big problem in their nation. A further 30% said that they thought it was a moderately big problem. A median of 60%, meanwhile, said that the political influence enjoyed by the wealthiest individuals was a major contributor to economic inequality. These views, Pew found, were particularly common among respondents identifying as being on the ideological left, though many of those who identified as being on the right agreed too. Ideological divisions, the research showed, were especially large in the U.S.  The WEF meeting this year takes place from Jan. 20 to Jan. 24. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cCollaboration for the Intelligent Age.\u201d The annual Davos meetings were first launched in 1971 to champion stakeholder capitalism but over the decades they\u2019ve become a punching bag for social justice advocates, largely because of the extreme wealth of many of the attendees. This year\u2014with many wars raging around the world\u2014armed conflict is likely to top the agenda and dominate conversations during the four days in the Alpine town. Donald Trump is expected to address the meeting on Jan. 23.",

    "title": "These Billionaires Pledged To Give Away Their Wealth. Instead, Most Are Getting Wealthier | Opinion",
    "domain": "newsweek.com",
    "text": "Published Aug 13, 2025 at 07:30 AM EDT Institute for Policy Studies The Giving Pledge just turned 15. Bill Gates, Melinda French, and Warren Buffett founded the Pledge in August 2010 to boost charitable giving among billionaires. Pledgers agree to give away half or more of their wealth within their lifetimes, or upon their deaths. The effort was inspired by Duty Free Shoppers founder Chuck Feeney, the reluctant billionaire who advocated \"giving while living.\" Feeney gave away over $8 billion before he died, relinquishing his billionaire status to live a more modest life. \"[Feeney] told me we should encourage people not to give just 50 percent,\" Gates recounted, \"but as much as possible during their lifetime.\" The Giving Pledge is the largest and most visible public commitment that billionaires have made to distribute their vast fortunes. Over 256 individuals, couples, and families have signed, including 194 from the United States. Our tax code's charitable deductions effectively allow billionaires to \"opt out\" of taxes\u2014ostensibly to give back through charity. In the absence of higher taxes on the wealthy that could fund a stronger social safety net, voluntary commitments like the Giving Pledge are important. But in an era of staggering wealth inequality\u2014and tax avoidance\u2014privately held fortunes are larger than anyone can fathom. And charitable contributions simply aren't keeping up with what could be raised from a fairer tax code. In our new report, The Giving Pledge at 15, we found that the explosive growth of Giving Pledgers' wealth is outpacing their giving. At this rate, the Giving Pledge appears to be mostly an empty promise. Along with our co-authors Helen Flannery and Dan Petegorsky, we analyzed the philanthropic records of the pledgers. Some are bold and direct, like MacKenzie Scott, who's vowed to \"keep at it until the safe is empty.\" Others need to pick up the pace, like John Paul DeJoria, whose foundation has awarded $54 million since its inception eight years ago\u2014a paltry sum compared to his roughly $3 billion fortune. And there are those who seem to cravenly intertwine personal benefit with philanthropy\u2014like Elon Musk, who in 2021 enjoyed some fortuitously timely tax relief from a stock transfer to his foundation. Across nearly every example, there's proof that the Pledge is unfulfilled, unfulfillable, and not our ticket to a fairer, better future. If hundreds of billionaires pledge to give away half their wealth in their lifetimes, we should expect that some would have less wealth than when they took the Pledge. But when adjusted for inflation, the 32 original U.S. pledgers who are still billionaires have collectively gotten 166 percent wealthier since they signed on in 2010. (Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan's wealth has increased an inflation-adjusted 2,919 percent since 2010!) Only one couple in this group, Laura and John Arnold, has fulfilled their commitment, moving billions in their lifetime\u2014mostly to their own foundation. But that raises another issue. By our count, 80 percent of Giving Pledge donations have gone to private foundations\u2014and billions more to other intermediaries. Donors get an immediate tax deduction, but the funds can remain sidelined for generations before they're granted out to real working charities\u2014if ever. Play this out another 15 years and we'll witness the rise of family-controlled dynastic foundations worth trillions. These foundations will wield tremendous power, especially as their windfalls contrast with catastrophic cuts to the social safety net like those in the GOP's Big Beautiful Bill. A select few families will essentially decide how publicly subsidized funds are spent, concentrating power over our politics and civil society and jeopardizing our democracy. At 15, the Giving Pledge must either go big or reconsider its value. One path forward is to encourage a \"Feeney Giving Pledge,\" an augmented commitment for existing pledgers to pay their fair share of taxes, give more while alive, and empower organizations led by non-billionaires to solve the urgent problems of our day. Feeney's example echoed in Bill Gates's May announcement that he would donate 99 percent of his Microsoft stock to his foundation, which he's pledged to wind down and close within 20 years. This voluntary effort would pair nicely with structural reforms. We should tax billionaires at a fair rate. And taxpayer-subsidized foundations and donor-advised funds (DAFs) should be subject to stronger transparency rules\u2014and required to grant out funds to real, working charities more quickly. If billionaires' best intentions can't deliver a fairer economy, then it's up to the rest of us not to count on them.

    "onlytext": "The Giving Pledge just turned 15. Bill Gates, Melinda French, and Warren Buffett founded the Pledge in August 2010 to boost charitable giving among billionaires. Pledgers agree to give away half or more of their wealth within their lifetimes, or upon their deaths. The effort was inspired by Duty Free Shoppers founder Chuck Feeney, the reluctant billionaire who advocated \"giving while living.\" Feeney gave away over $8 billion before he died, relinquishing his billionaire status to live a more modest life. \n\n\"[Feeney] told me we should encourage people not to give just 50 percent,\" Gates recounted, \"but as much as possible during their lifetime.\" The Giving Pledge is the largest and most visible public commitment that billionaires have made to distribute their vast fortunes. Over 256 individuals, couples, and families have signed, including 194 from the United States.\n\nOur tax code's charitable deductions effectively allow billionaires to \"opt out\" of taxes\u2014ostensibly to give back through charity. In the absence of higher taxes on the wealthy that could fund a stronger social safety net, voluntary commitments like the Giving Pledge are important. But in an era of staggering wealth inequality\u2014and tax avoidance\u2014privately held fortunes are larger than anyone can fathom. And charitable contributions simply aren't keeping up with what could be raised from a fairer tax code.\n\nIn our new report, The Giving Pledge at 15, we found that the explosive growth of Giving Pledgers' wealth is outpacing their giving. At this rate, the Giving Pledge appears to be mostly an empty promise. Along with our co-authors Helen Flannery and Dan Petegorsky, we analyzed the philanthropic records of the pledgers. Some are bold and direct, like MacKenzie Scott, who's vowed to \"keep at it until the safe is empty.\" Others need to pick up the pace, like John Paul DeJoria, whose foundation has awarded $54 million since its inception eight years ago\u2014a paltry sum compared to his roughly $3 billion fortune. And there are those who seem to cravenly intertwine personal benefit with philanthropy\u2014like Elon Musk, who in 2021 enjoyed some fortuitously timely tax relief from a stock transfer to his foundation.\n\nAcross nearly every example, there's proof that the Pledge is unfulfilled, unfulfillable, and not our ticket to a fairer, better future. If hundreds of billionaires pledge to give away half their wealth in their lifetimes, we should expect that some would have less wealth than when they took the Pledge. But when adjusted for inflation, the 32 original U.S. pledgers who are still billionaires have collectively gotten 166 percent wealthier since they signed on in 2010. (Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan's wealth has increased an inflation-adjusted 2,919 percent since 2010!) Only one couple in this group, Laura and John Arnold, has fulfilled their commitment, moving billions in their lifetime\u2014mostly to their own foundation.\n\nBut that raises another issue. By our count, 80 percent of Giving Pledge donations have gone to private foundations\u2014and billions more to other intermediaries. Donors get an immediate tax deduction, but the funds can remain sidelined for generations before they're granted out to real working charities\u2014if ever.

    "text": "If there's one thing the Trump administration has a surplus of, it's billionaires. President Donald Trump himself is America's first billionaire president, boasting a net worth of $5.3 billion, according to Forbes. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found the median weekly earnings for U.S. workers was $1,194 in the first quarter of 2025 \u2013 or $62,088 a year. At that rate, it would take the average American roughly 85,350 years to reach Trump's net worth. Meanwhile, the total net worth of the billionaires who make up Trump's changing administration \u2013 including former friend Elon Musk, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent among them \u2013 equals at least $450 billion. And that money buys a lot of influence \u2013 and power. Maybe too much. That's the question we asked you. As part of our Opinion Forum, we asked USA TODAY readers what you thought about the growing power of billionaires: in our corporations, in our markets and, yes, in our government. Is this exorbitant wealth something to aspire to? Or is it a threat? Read the responses below. I do think the wealthy have too much power. Who listens to someone making minimum wage? (I'm speaking, by the way, as a former sociology professor, jail administrator and jail standards specialist.) Having a large number of very wealthy people in political power also has a negative effect on our democracy. The richer people are, the less they are in tune with the common people they are supposed to represent. The growth in the number of billionaires and in their collective wealth is not a sign of a healthy economy. A healthy economy is defined by a more equal income distribution. In the 1980s, CEOs earned about 40 times more than their hourly employees. Today it's about 300 times. There is something horribly wrong with this picture! I do think taxes should be raised on the the richest people in our country. The wealthy are not paying their fair share. They sit back in their mansions and yachts while the rest of us are desperately trying to keep our canoes afloat. \u2014 Bev Scott, Trinity, Texas Without data directly on hand about how much people in different income strata contribute to the federal budget, it\u2019s hard to answer questions like whether we should raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans. But I'm in my 70s and have witnessed many things. My parents and their parents worked until they died. That work ethic comes with compensation. Some do better than others. The common thread is working. I support the work requirements for Medicaid recently approved by Congress and signed into law. The details are rarely published. The headlines are almost always divisive and incomplete.\u00a0 Let\u2019s stop accusing the wealthy as if they are criminals. They pay most of the taxes and give a tremendous amount to philanthropy.\u00a0Google it! Get the best education you can afford. Get a job that adds value to your life and work hard. Vote in every election. And try your best to live a good life.\u00a0Stop judging others. \u2014 Rick Bateman, Loveland, Ohio Our distribution of wealth is completely out of balance and will have dire consequences. I have no argument against infinite personal wealth as long as every citizen has access to basic essentials. Food, medical care, shelter, public safety, etc. should be a foundation for the populace. The uber wealthy can have all the mansions they want once everyone has a roof. Wealth is achieved through more than business acumen. Billionaires exist because they utilize economic and civic infrastructure, provided collectively by all of us. Their argument that \"I did it\" is, at best, specious. Without fundamental change, this will end badly. \u2014 Sam Collins, Gainesville, Florida The increased involvement of billionaires in our government has a huge effect on how our system operates. The ultra rich have always held sway over American democracy, but the days of their political dealings being done behind the scenes are long gone. Now, it's not only out in public every day that billionaires are controlling the government and looking to alter the country in such a way to elevate themselves even further above the average person, but it's also that a huge portion of the American public, most of them people who will be affected negatively by these actions, is still hugely supportive of this regime. This means that the country can continue to be run in such a way that the marginalized are stomped on while the rich get richer. It is now to the point that the Trump regime can brazenly break laws and defy courts with few to no repercussions, and this is, surely enough, eroding away the foundation of American democracy. \u2014 Ben Rivera, Salt Lake City",

Among the clique were the three richest men in the world: Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and top dog Elon Musk, who personally poured $277m into Trump\u2019s election campaign, increasing his own wealth by $170bn as a result. Money equals power, so the saying goes, and right now it\u2019s playing out on the world stage. As we know, Musk\u2019s efforts to get Trump into the White House earned him a role heading up the new department of government efficiency \u2013 or Doge for short, conveniently echoing the same name of the cryptocurrency he promotes. A man born into wealth and privilege is advising the president on how the US should protect its cash, alongside about a dozen other billionaire officials. Meanwhile, the rest of the world lives in economic fear as the gap between the super-rich and everyone else quickly becomes a chasm. These super-rich people are so far out of touch with reality, it\u2019s infuriating. Wealth is no longer about financial worth, it\u2019s about control \u2013 of our democracies, societies, economies and planet. Trump\u2019s appointees are just the latest example of how inequality and extreme wealth hurt us all. Billionaire wealth rose three times faster in 2024 than in 2023. Five trillionaires are now expected within a decade, according to data from Oxfam. Meanwhile, progress on global poverty has stalled. Inequality is out of control. On his first day back at the White House, Trump signed a slew of executive orders, winding back the clock of progress with every signature. He said he would only be a dictator on day one. Time will tell. Soon after, he took centre stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos among heads of state, politicians and business moguls who had jetted in for the annual conference at God knows what cost to finances and the environment. Trump appeared by video link and spent much of the time making bossy demands and threats, like a scene from The Apprentice. Once again, this is not TV. This is real life. His decisions affect us all. I\u2019m someone who has lived with both poverty and wealth \u2013 but increasingly people from my working-class background will not be given the opportunities afforded to me. Because wealth is becoming more concentrated, cronyism is growing and the rest of the world is suffering. Some at least are calling it out. Last month, nearly 400 millionaires and billionaires signed a letter asking leaders at Davos to take action on extreme wealth \u2013 by taxing the super-rich, like them. And, in his farewell speech, the then US president, Joe Biden, warned of a dangerous oligarchy taking shape. This should be a wake-up call to us all \u2013 especially those people elected to represent us. Governments must address the obscene political capture we are witnessing. One simple way to do this is to tax the super-rich. These people now manage so much more than money. They manage what we read, what we watch, the information we\u2019re given and, ultimately, how we vote. Last year, the EU Tax Observatory estimated that a 2% tax on billionaires could raise up to $250bn a year. About 3,000 people would pay it, and it would make very little difference to their lives. For everyone else, though, it would begin to rein in extreme wealth and fight back against the rising inequality that is damaging lives across the world.

Baby Boomers are trying to figure out what to do with their wealth: Give it to their kids now, or wait until they pass on.\u00a0 It\u2019s a nice problem to have, surely, but when it concerns the $80 trillion Great Wealth Transfer the indecision could have major ramifications for both heirs and the rest of the U.S. economy. One study found that for many Boomers, the question has already been decided: Hurry up and wait, kids.\n\n\n\n \n Nearly half of high-net-worth Baby Boomers\u2014people between the ages of 60 and 79 with more than $1 million in investable assets\u2014say they plan to hold onto their wealth during their lifetime, according to a recent survey from Charles Schwab. Between rising healthcare costs and living longer, Boomer respondents say they plan to hold onto their wealth for longer.\n\n\n\n That\u2019s in stark contrast to the nearly 97% of Gen Xers and Millennials who say they will share their wealth while they\u2019re still alive.\u00a0 \n One reason for Boomers\u2019 view on their wealth has to do with innovative financial advice, says Susan Hirshman, director of wealth management for Schwab Wealth Advisory and Schwab Center for Financial Research. With an emphasis on goal-based financial planning, she says, young generations know if they will have a wealth surplus\u2014and then can consider what to do with it earlier.\n\n\n\n \u201cA financial plan is a living, breathing tool,\u201d Hirshamn says. \u201cIt needs to be evaluated on a consistent basis, and as life changes, your plan may have to change and adapt to those changing needs.\u201d\n\n\n\n Younger generations stand to benefit the most from the Great Wealth Transfer, but the latest Schwab High Net Worth Investor Survey indicates that high-net-worth Millennials and Gen Xers are more than twice as likely to share their wealth with the next generation during their lifetime as compared to Boomers.\n\n\n\n This could be tied to the fact that younger generations are more cognizant of the wealth disparities in the U.S. and around the world. At age 35, the wealthiest millennials tend to have more money than their baby boomer counterparts, and the poorest have less, according to a study from the American Journal of Sociology.\n\n\n\n The total billionaire wealth increased by $2 trillion in 2024 alone\u2014and each billionaire\u2019s wealth grew about $2 million per day on average, according to Oxfam. The year also brought 204 newly minted billionaires, equating to about four new per week. In the next decade, the organization predicts there will be five trillionaires. \n Even members of the ultra-rich agree that wealth issues are out of hand. Bill Gates, one of the wealthiest individuals on Earth, called for increased taxes on the rich\u2014so far as to say he would support a tax that would reduce his wealth by over $100 billion. Gates, along with dozens of other ultra-rich individuals, pledged to donate a majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\n\n\n Schwab\u2019s data suggests that the Great Wealth Transfer will go slower than anticipated, but most wealthy Americans believe that sharing some wealth while they are alive is important so they can financially support their families, share in their joy, and make memories together.\u00a0\n\n\n\n However, a majority are planning to only distribute about 40% of their assets while living\u2014leaving the rest to pass on after their passing. Only about a quarter of Americans with children have had discussions about generational wealth, and even those who do, communication is often limited and inconclusive, according to research from Edward Jones.\n\n\n\n Hirshman says being open about estate planning sooner rather than later will lead to less headache for families during a time that should be dedicated to grieving and remembrance.\n\n\n\n \u201cBy having those conversations early, explaining what's going to happen, who to call, where the documents are, right, what the resources are, what the plan is, how we thought about everything,\u201d says Hirshman. \u201cIt allows for calmer, controlled execution of the estate plan.\u201d \n The good news is that the younger generations are already listening. Sixty-three percent of wealthy individuals are starting to plan before they turn 45 years old. To transfer wealth appropriately, Hirshman says, it starts with playing the \u2018what if\u2019 game. Before over-transferring, one should consider questions like: What if your healthcare costs are extreme? What if you live to 100?\n\n\n\n Above all, she encourages individuals to engage in effective communication, consistent reviews of financial plans\u2014both in terms of taxes and family dynamics\u2014and honest conversations about responsibilities. For example, who is the executor or trustee, or does outside help need to be brought in?\n\n\n\n Younger generations also plan to attach more strings to their wealth. While 97% of millennials plan to have some kind of stipulation to their money transfer, only 34% of Boomers care. Overall, Hirshman says conversations about wealth transfer are not about only keeping or only giving\u2014it\u2019s about doing both, responsibly.\n  \u00a9 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

    "text": "How to be a billionaire and pay no taxes Listen to more stories on the  Noa app. This is Work in Progress, a newsletter about work, technology, and how to solve some of America\u2019s biggest problems. Sign up here. America\u2019s superrich have always found ways to avoid paying taxes, but in recent years, they\u2019ve discovered what might be the mother of all loopholes. It\u2019s a three-step process called \u201cBuy, Borrow, Die,\u201d and it allows people to amass a huge fortune, spend as much of it as they want, and pass the rest\u2014untaxed\u2014on to their heirs. The technique is so cleverly designed that the standard wish list of progressive tax reforms would leave it completely intact. Step one: buy. The average American derives most of their disposable income from the wages they earn working a job, but the superrich are different. They amass their fortune by buying and owning assets that appreciate. Elon Musk hasn\u2019t taken a traditional salary as CEO of Tesla since 2019; Warren Buffett, the chair of Berkshire Hathaway, has famously kept his salary at $100,000 for more than 40 years. Their wealth consists almost entirely of stock in the companies they\u2019ve built or invested in. The tax-law scholars Edward Fox and Zachary Liscow found that even when you exclude the 400 wealthiest individuals in America, the remaining members of the top 1 percent hold $23 trillion in assets. Unlike wages, which are taxed the moment they are earned, assets are taxed only at the moment they are sold\u2014or, in tax terms, \u201crealized.\u201d The justification for this approach is that unrealized assets exist only on paper; you can\u2019t pay for a private jet or buy a company with stocks, even if they have appreciated by billions of dollars. In theory, the rich will eventually need to sell their assets for cash, at which point they will pay taxes on their increase in wealth. That theory would be much closer to reality if not for step two: borrow. Instead of selling their assets to make major purchases, the superrich can use them as collateral to secure loans, which, because they must eventually be repaid, are also not considered taxable income. Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle and America\u2019s fourth-richest person, has pledged more than $30 billion of his company\u2019s stock as collateral in order to fund his lavish lifestyle, which includes building a $270 million yacht, buying a $300 million island, and purchasing an $80 million mansion. A Forbes analysis found that, as of April 2022, Musk had pledged Tesla shares worth more than $94 billion, which \u201cserve as an evergreen credit facility, giving Musk access to cash when he needs it.\u201d This strategy isn\u2019t as common among the merely very rich, who may not have the expensive tastes that Ellison and Musk do, but it isn\u2019t rare either. Liscow and Fox calculated that the top 1 percent of wealth-holders, excluding the richest 400 Americans, borrowed more than $1 trillion in 2022. And the approach appears to be gaining momentum. Last year, The Economist reported that, at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America alone, the value of \u201csecurities-backed loans\u201d increased from $80 billion in 2018 to almost $150 billion in 2022. \u201cThe real question is: Why would you not borrow hundreds of millions, even billions, to fund the lifestyle you want to live?\u201d Tom Anderson, a wealth-management consultant and former banker who specializes in these loans, told me. \u201cThis is such an easy tool to use. And the tax benefits are massive.\u201d Annie Lowrey: Trump says his tax plan won\u2019t benefit the rich\u2014he\u2019s exactly wrong You might think this couldn\u2019t possibly go on forever. Eventually, the rich will need to sell off some of their assets to pay back the loan. That brings us to step three: die. According to a provision of the tax code known as \u201cstepped-up basis\u201d\u2014or, more evocatively, the \u201cangel of death\u201d loophole\u2014when an individual dies, the value that their assets gained during their lifetime becomes immune to taxation. Those assets can then be sold by the billionaire\u2019s heirs to pay off any outstanding loans without them having to worry about taxes. The justification for the stepped-up-basis rule is that the United States already levies a 40 percent inheritance tax on fortunes larger than $14 million, and it would be unfair to tax assets twice. In practice, however, a seemingly infinite number of loopholes allow the rich to avoid paying this tax, many of which involve placing assets in byzantine legal trusts that enable them to be passed seamlessly from one generation to the next. \u201cOnly morons pay the estate tax,\u201d Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive and the then\u2013chief economic adviser to Donald Trump, memorably remarked in 2017. \u201cAll of this is completely, perfectly legal,\u201d Edward McCaffery, the scholar who coined the term Buy, Borrow, Die, told me. But, he said, the strategy \u201chas basically killed the entire concept of an income tax for the wealthiest individuals.\u201d The tax economist Daniel Reck, who has spent his career documenting the various ways the rich evade taxation, told me that Buy, Borrow, Die is \u201cthe most important tax-avoidance strategy today.\u201d The result is a two-tiered tax system: one for the many, who earn their income through wages and pay taxes, and another for the few, who accumulate wealth through paper assets and largely do not pay taxes. Much of the debate around American tax policy focuses on the income-tax rate paid by the very wealthiest Americans. But the bulk of those people\u2019s fortunes doesn\u2019t qualify as income in the first place. A 2021 ProPublica investigation of the private tax records of America\u2019s 25 richest individuals found that they collectively paid an effective tax rate of just 3.4 percent on their total wealth gain from 2014 to 2018. Musk paid 3.3 percent, Jeff Bezos 1 percent, and Buffett\u2014who has famously argued for imposing higher income-tax rates on the superrich\u2014just 0.1 percent. The same dynamic exists, in slightly less egregious form, further down the wealth distribution. A 2021 White House study found that the 400 richest American households paid an effective tax rate of 8.2 percent on their total wealth gains from 2010 to 2018. Liscow and Fox found that, excluding the top 400, the rest of the 0.1 percent richest individuals paid an effective rate of 12 percent from 2004 to 2022. (Twelve percent is the income-tax rate paid by individuals who make $11,601 to $47,150 a year.) One solution to this basic unfairness would be to tax unrealized assets. In 2022, the Biden administration proposed a \u201cbillionaire minimum tax\u201d that would have placed a new annual levy of up to 20 percent on the appreciation of even unsold assets for households with more than $100 million in wealth. Experts have vehemently debated the substantive merits of such a policy; the real problem, however, is political. According to a survey conducted by Liscow and Fox, most Americans oppose a tax on unrealized gains even when applied only to the richest individuals. The Joe Biden proposal, perhaps unsurprisingly, went nowhere in Congress. Making matters more complicated, even if such a policy did pass, the Supreme Court would very likely rule it unconstitutional. James Kwak: The tax code for the ultra-rich vs. the one for everyone else A second idea would be to address the \u201cborrow\u201d step. Last year, Liscow and Fox published a proposal to tax the borrowing of households worth more than $100 million, which they estimated would raise about $10 billion a year. The limitation of that solution, as the authors acknowledge, is that it would not address the larger pool of rich Americans who don\u2019t borrow heavily against their assets but do take advantage of stepped-up basis. That leaves the \u201cdie\u201d step. Tax experts from across the political spectrum generally support eliminating the \u201cstepped-up basis\u201d rule, allowing unrealized assets to be taxed at death. This would be far more politically palatable than the dead-on-arrival billionaire\u2019s minimum tax: In the same survey in which respondents overwhelmingly opposed broad taxes on unrealized assets during life, Liscow and Fox also found that nearly two-thirds of them supported taxing unrealized assets at death. Even a change this widely supported, however, would run up against the iron law of democratic politics: Policies with concentrated benefits and distributed costs are very hard to overturn. That\u2019s especially true when the benefits just so happen to be concentrated among the richest, most powerful people in the country. In fact, the Biden administration did propose eliminating stepped-up basis as part of its Build Back Better legislation. The move prompted an intense backlash from special-interest groups and their allied politicians, with opponents portraying the provision as an assault on rural America that would destroy family farms and businesses. These claims were completely unfounded\u2014the bill had specific exemptions for family businesses and applied only to assets greater than $2.5 million\u2014but the effort succeeded at riling up enough Democratic opposition to kill the idea. The one guarantee of any tax regime is that, eventually, the rich and powerful will learn how to game it. In theory, a democratic system, operating on behalf of the majority, should be able to respond by making adjustments that force the rich to pay their fair share. But in a world where money readily translates to political power, voice, and influence, the superrich have virtually endless resources at their disposal to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. To make society more equal, you need to tax the rich. But to tax the rich, it helps for society to be more equal. TheAtlantic.com \u00a9 2025 The Atlantic Monthly Group. All Rights Reserved.

Elon Musk hasn\u2019t taken a traditional salary as CEO of Tesla since 2019; Warren Buffett, the chair of Berkshire Hathaway, has famously kept his salary at $100,000 for more than 40 years. Their wealth consists almost entirely of stock in the companies they\u2019ve built or invested in. The tax-law scholars Edward Fox and Zachary Liscow found that even when you exclude the 400 wealthiest individuals in America, the remaining members of the top 1 percent hold $23 trillion in assets. Unlike wages, which are taxed the moment they are earned, assets are taxed only at the moment they are sold\u2014or, in tax terms, \u201crealized.\u201d The justification for this approach is that unrealized assets exist only on paper; you can\u2019t pay for a private jet or buy a company with stocks, even if they have appreciated by billions of dollars. In theory, the rich will eventually need to sell their assets for cash, at which point they will pay taxes on their increase in wealth.\n\nThat theory would be much closer to reality if not for step two: borrow. Instead of selling their assets to make major purchases, the superrich can use them as collateral to secure loans, which, because they must eventually be repaid, are also not considered taxable income. Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle and America\u2019s fourth-richest person, has pledged more than $30 billion of his company\u2019s stock as collateral in order to fund his lavish lifestyle, which includes building a $270 million yacht, buying a $300 million island, and purchasing an $80 million mansion. A Forbes analysis found that, as of April 2022, Musk had pledged Tesla shares worth more than $94 billion, which \u201cserve as an evergreen credit facility, giving Musk access to cash when he needs it.\u201d This strategy isn\u2019t as common among the merely very rich, who may not have the expensive tastes that Ellison and Musk do, but it isn\u2019t rare either. Liscow and Fox calculated that the top 1 percent of wealth-holders, excluding the richest 400 Americans, borrowed more than $1 trillion in 2022. And the approach appears to be gaining momentum. Last year, The Economist reported that, at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America alone, the value of \u201csecurities-backed loans\u201d increased from $80 billion in 2018 to almost $150 billion in 2022. \u201cThe real question is: Why would you not borrow hundreds of millions, even billions, to fund the lifestyle you want to live?\u201d Tom Anderson, a wealth-management consultant and former banker who specializes in these loans, told me. \u201cThis is such an easy tool to use. And the tax benefits are massive.\u201d\n\nYou might think this couldn\u2019t possibly go on forever. Eventually, the rich will need to sell off some of their assets to pay back the loan. That brings us to step three: die. According to a provision of the tax code known as \u201cstepped-up basis\u201d\u2014or, more evocatively, the \u201cangel of death\u201d loophole\u2014when an individual dies, the value that their assets gained during their lifetime becomes immune to taxation. Those assets can then be sold by the billionaire\u2019s heirs to pay off any outstanding loans without them having to worry about taxes. The justification for the stepped-up-basis rule is that the United States already levies a 40 percent inheritance tax on fortunes larger than $14 million, and it would be unfair to tax assets twice. In practice, however, a seemingly infinite number of loopholes allow the rich to avoid paying this tax, many of which involve placing assets in byzantine legal trusts that enable them to be passed seamlessly from one generation to the next. \u201cOnly morons pay the estate tax,\u201d Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive and the then\u2013chief economic adviser to Donald Trump, memorably remarked in 2017. \u201cAll of this is completely, perfectly legal,\u201d Edward McCaffery, the scholar who coined the term Buy, Borrow, Die, told me. But, he said, the strategy \u201chas basically killed the entire concept of an income tax for the wealthiest individuals.\u201d The tax economist Daniel Reck, who has spent his career documenting the various ways the rich evade taxation, told me that Buy, Borrow, Die is \u201cthe most important tax-avoidance strategy today.\u201d\n\nThe result is a two-tiered tax system: one for the many, who earn their income through wages and pay taxes, and another for the few, who accumulate wealth through paper assets and largely do not pay taxes. Much of the debate around American tax policy focuses on the income-tax rate paid by the very wealthiest Americans. But the bulk of those people\u2019s fortunes doesn\u2019t qualify as income in the first place. A 2021 ProPublica investigation of the private tax records of America\u2019s 25 richest individuals found that they collectively paid an effective tax rate of just 3.4 percent on their total wealth gain from 2014 to 2018. Musk paid 3.3 percent, Jeff Bezos 1 percent, and Buffett\u2014who has famously argued for imposing higher income-tax rates on the superrich\u2014just 0.1 percent. The same dynamic exists, in slightly less egregious form, further down the wealth distribution. A 2021 White House study found that the 400 richest American households paid an effective tax rate of 8.2 percent on their total wealth gains from 2010 to 2018. Liscow and Fox found that, excluding the top 400, the rest of the 0.1 percent richest individuals paid an effective rate of 12 percent from 2004 to 2022. (Twelve percent is the income-tax rate paid by individuals who make $11,601 to $47,150 a year.)\n\nOne solution to this basic unfairness would be to tax unrealized assets. In 2022, the Biden administration proposed a \u201cbillionaire minimum tax\u201d that would have placed a new annual levy of up to 20 percent on the appreciation of even unsold assets for households with more than $100 million in wealth. Experts have vehemently debated the substantive merits of such a policy; the real problem, however, is political. According to a survey conducted by Liscow and Fox, most Americans oppose a tax on unrealized gains even when applied only to the richest individuals. The Joe Biden proposal, perhaps unsurprisingly, went nowhere in Congress. Making matters more complicated, even if such a policy did pass, the Supreme Court would very likely rule it unconstitutional.\n\nA second idea would be to address the \u201cborrow\u201d step. Last year, Liscow and Fox published a proposal to tax the borrowing of households worth more than $100 million, which they estimated would raise about $10 billion a year. The limitation of that solution, as the authors acknowledge, is that it would not address the larger pool of rich Americans who don\u2019t borrow heavily against their assets but do take advantage of stepped-up basis.\n\nThat leaves the \u201cdie\u201d step. Tax experts from across the political spectrum generally support eliminating the \u201cstepped-up basis\u201d rule, allowing unrealized assets to be taxed at death. This would be far more politically palatable than the dead-on-arrival billionaire\u2019s minimum tax: In the same survey in which respondents overwhelmingly opposed broad taxes on unrealized assets during life, Liscow and Fox also found that nearly two-thirds of them supported taxing unrealized assets at death. Even a change this widely supported, however, would run up against the iron law of democratic politics: Policies with concentrated benefits and distributed costs are very hard to overturn. That\u2019s especially true when the benefits just so happen to be concentrated among the richest, most powerful people in the country. In fact, the Biden administration did propose eliminating stepped-up basis as part of its Build Back Better legislation. The move prompted an intense backlash from special-interest groups and their allied politicians, with opponents portraying the provision as an assault on rural America that would destroy family farms and businesses. These claims were completely unfounded\u2014the bill had specific exemptions for family businesses and applied only to assets greater than $2.5 million\u2014but the effort succeeded at riling up enough Democratic opposition to kill the idea.\n\nThe one guarantee of any tax regime is that, eventually, the rich and powerful will learn how to game it. In theory, a democratic system, operating on behalf of the majority, should be able to respond by making adjustments that force the rich to pay their fair share. But in a world where money readily translates to political power, voice, and influence, the superrich have virtually endless resources at their disposal to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. To make society more equal, you need to tax the rich. But to tax the rich, it helps for society to be more equal.",

    "text": "\u201cCalifornia used to be the Golden State. Now it\u2019s rusted and destroyed,\u201d says energy drinks magnate Russ Weiner. In a way, the state\u2019s flush with gold; California is a treasure trove of extreme wealth. But some of its most affluent residents, including Weiner (worth an estimated $4.8 billion as of the date of publishing), have also been moving away, Forbes finds in a 20-year analysis of the annual Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. California has consistently been home to more members of The Forbes 400 than any other state, and now has 87. But that\u2019s six fewer than two decades ago. Plenty of California-based tech tycoons moved on and off the list over the years as their fortunes fluctuated with the stock market, but some disappeared because billionaires just up and left. Over the past 20 years, while gaining new Forbes 400 residents, California lost 19 of them to other states, particularly Texas, Nevada and Florida, where Rockstar Energy drink founder Weiner moved in 2009. What made him want to skip town? \u201cCrime, homelessness, education, taxes,\u201d he says. Oh, and Democrats.  Weiner is far from the only uber-wealthy entrepreneur who\u2019s been chasing both rays and lower taxes. Florida and Texas, which have neither state income tax nor state capital gains tax, both saw dramatic 20-year upticks in residents who made the 400 list. Texas went from 36 to 45, a 25% jump, while Florida \u2014 stunningly \u2014 doubled from 23 to 46 members of the list. Most of the increase in Florida came from Forbes 400 members moving there. That includes the likes of hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin, a former longtime resident of Chicago, who also relocated his firm Citadel to Miami because he said it offered a better corporate environment; Paychex founder Tom Golisano, who said he was escaping New York\u2019s high taxes when he moved to Naples in 2009; Charles B. Johnson, who moved to Palm Beach from California after retiring from money management firm Franklin Resources; and Thomas Peterffy of Interactive Brokers, who left Connecticut around 2015, also for Palm Beach. An outsized number of the last decade\u2019s Florida transplants came from the northeastern elite enclaves of New York, Connecticut and Illinois, and most made their fortunes in finance and investments. A far smaller amount of the list\u2019s new Floridians created fortunes in the Sunshine State from the start, like Nick Caporella, whose National Beverage makes the popular La Croix bubbly water. The picture is much dimmer in the Midwest, which has been shedding the extremely wealthy. The number of richest Americans there dropped 42% over the past two decades, from 73 to 42, mostly because Heartland billionaires\u2019 fortunes decreased or didn\u2019t keep pace with the rest of the country. (The cutoff to make the Forbes 400 rose from $600 million in 2003 to $2.9 billion in 2023.) But some just moved to warmer pastures, like movie producer Gigi Pritzker (who changed her permanent address from Chicago to California around 2019) or two heirs to the Walmart fortune (from Missouri to Texas and Nevada). And about 30% of Midwesterners on the 2003 and 2013 Forbes 400 lists have since dropped off because they passed away. In the last few years, that\u2019s included iconic figures like Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Walter Scott Jr. (a former Omaha resident who was a close friend of Warren Buffett) and Chicago\u2019s Sam Zell (forefather of the modern real estate investment trust), and a bit before them, William Ford Sr, the last grandchild of Henry Ford, who lived in Michigan. The manufacturing industry saw a particularly high number of drop-offs \u2014 paralleling the decades-long manufacturing decline in the Midwest \u2014 as did media, real estate and retail. Minnesota has been hit hardest. It ranked No. 9 among states with the most 400 members in 2003, when there were 11, but has now been completely drained out. A single family had an outsized impact on that decline. The clan behind the world\u2019s biggest agriculture company, Cargill, used to be concentrated in the North Star State, where the business is still based. But Cargill\u2019s old guard has died and the richest family members are now scattered across the country in Montana, Wisconsin, Missouri and California. This scenario \u2014 where a company\u2019s big shareholders live far from the company itself \u2014 is actually not unusual. And it may be even more common these days in a place like Minnesota, says the Tax Foundation\u2019s Jared Walczak. \u201cMinnesota does very well with traditional C corporations,\u201d says Walczak. \u201cIt\u2019s high taxes, but those high taxes historically have not fallen very heavily on businesses, so it's been a very competitive place to operate your Fortune 500 company. But you also have a situation where states like this may be unattractive for the C-suites themselves,\u201d perhaps in part because of those higher individual taxes. And in an increasingly mobile environment, he points out, not even high-level executives need to live where they work. Although taxes matter, Walczak and other analysts stress that it\u2019s far from the only consideration for billionaires when it comes to planning where to live. It often isn\u2019t even the top factor. \u201cMany state lawmakers overestimate how sensitive rich people are to a few percentage points\u2019 difference in the state tax rate,\u201d says Carl Davis of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Richard Auxier of the Tax Policy Center agrees: \u201cIf you\u2019re in West Virginia or Michigan and you think the taxes are the only thing that\u2019s different about your state and Florida and Texas, I really need you to think a bit harder.\u201d  Instead, the decision of where to live is hyper-personal, they say, noting that being closer to family is a frequent reason why billionaires move. The uber-wealthy also pursue top education systems, keeping in mind both their kids as well as their company workforces. Urban amenities are a big draw. So are safe neighborhoods, good infrastructure and centers of culture. The culture is what AriZona Iced Tea founder Don Vultaggio, raised in Brooklyn and worth an estimated $5.6 billion, loves about New York City. (Vultaggio now lives outside the city, in the Long Island enclave of Port Washington.) He remembers a conversation he once had with Andrew Cuomo: \u201c\u2018Governor, businesses don\u2019t mind paying taxes. We like it here. Museums, theater. It\u2019s great.\u2019\u201d Many must agree, as the number of New Yorkers on the 400 shot up 27% over the past two decades, from 49 to 62. Extreme wealth has been consolidating in the United States. Back in 2003, the 10 states with the most 400 members had 275 of them; today, they have 297. Exactly 60% of the billionaires who made the list this year live in just four states: California, New York, Florida and Texas \u2014 the four states with the largest populations, together home to one third of all Americans. \u201cThe growing geographic concentration helps explain our populist politics these days,\u201d says Darrell West, author of the 2014 book Billionaires: Reflections on the Upper Crust. \u201cMuch of the country is being left behind in terms of economic activity.\u201d A handful of states \u2014 Maine, Delaware, North Dakota, New Mexico and Alaska \u2014 haven\u2019t had a resident make The Forbes 400 list in at least two decades. On the other hand, the picture has been getting much rosier in places like Arizona and Georgia, which joined the top 10 states for the first time in 2014 (when the latter was tied with Maryland and Tennessee at 7 list members) and now ranks No. 6 with 10 Forbes 400 residents. Iowa and Kentucky both had no 400 members in 2003 and now each have one: Harry Stine (worth an estimated $8.8 billion, who joined the list in 2014), and Tamara Gustavson ($7.4 billion, 2011), respectively. This is also a great year for Mississippi, which made the list for only the second time in two decades. Joining the ranks of the richest are Hattiesburg\u2019s Duff brothers, who are behind the holding company Duff Capital Investors, which owns construction, energy and trucking firms. \u201cMississippi is a good place to do business, mainly because of our people, who are hard-working, optimistic and dedicated to providing a better future for their families,\u201d says Thomas Duff, who\u2019s worth an estimated $3 billion. \u201cKeeping a Mississippi-based operation for our companies has helped us stay true to our values.\u201d Sitting at the very bottom of the Forbes wealth ranking is Alaska, which has never had a resident make the 400 list since it was first published in 1982. That does constitute a loss for the Last Frontier. \u201cYou would love to have billionaires living in your state,\u201d says the Tax Policy Center\u2019s Auxier, explaining that the attraction is not just tax revenue but also the companies the wealthy often start or bring. \u201cSomeone just sitting on their money, they\u2019ll take them, they don\u2019t want to lose them \u2014 but if you talk to someone in these states, what they really want is a billionaire who is participating in the economy and hopefully has businesses in the state.\u201d Of course, there\u2019s only so much a state can do to court the rich. With great wealth comes great mobility. The Americans with the deepest pockets will go where they want. ",

    "title": "How to Soak the Rich",
    "domain": "theatlantic.com",
    "text": "Democratic 2020 candidates are already discussing how to make a more progressive tax code. What\u2019s the best way? With the 2020 primary already under way and the House back in Democratic hands, the left has proposed a number of spending programs aimed at ending poverty and boosting the middle class: a jobs guarantee, a Green New Deal, a massive expansion of the earned-income tax credit, Medicare for All, a universal child allowance, and on and on. Democrats do not want to talk about how to pay for each and every penny of such proposals. But it is clear they intend to raise more money from the rich, and are now pushing policies that would do just that. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to raise the top marginal income-tax rate to 70 percent; for every dollar a person earns over $10 million, Ocasio-Cortez suggests, he should be left with 30 cents. Senator Bernie Sanders, a likely 2020 candidate, wants to expand the estate tax. And Senator Elizabeth Warren, a definite 2020 candidate, has proposed an annual tax on wealth, taking 2 percent of fortunes over $50 million and an additional 1 percent of fortunes over $1 billion. The shared idea here is to make the tax code far more progressive as the left makes the government far more redistributive. Such tax policies tend to please liberals concerned that the party has failed to curtail inequality and to blunt its political effects, and terrify conservatives who argue that such policies are confiscatory and would hurt long-term growth. But what about the tax nerds? What do they make of these ideas on how to soak the rich? Shadi Hamid: Ocasio-Cortez understands politics better than her critics The green-eyeshade folks aren\u2019t fond of short, easy answers. But, to start, experts said that there was nothing unusual or even that radical about what Ocasio-Cortez has in mind. Higher rates were common throughout the 20th century, with the top marginal rate averaging 78 percent from 1930 to 1980 and climbing up to 90 percent in the late 1950s and early \u201960s. \u201cOcasio-Cortez has done a great public service in just saying, \u2018You know, we could have higher rates,\u2019\u201d said Mark Mazur, an economist at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, D.C. \u201cIn the past, we have had them, and they worked. And you don\u2019t have to go all the way to 70 percent. But right now we\u2019re stuck with this question of whether the top rate should be 39.6 percent or 37 percent\u2014that\u2019s a pretty narrow range. What she\u2019s saying is you can imagine taking them up a lot higher.\u201d That said, if the goal is to raise more money for redistributive policies and to ensure that millionaires pay their fair share, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposal isn\u2019t particularly efficient. It might not even raise that much money, instead discouraging employers from paying workers more than $10 million or workers from trying to earn more than that threshold. Imagine you were a lawyer who often earned in the high millions a year; if you hit the $9 million mark in the fall, you might work somewhat less, knowing that much of what you made over $10 million would get taxed away. The tax rate would, in effect, reduce inequality in pretax incomes, as well as in posttax incomes. (It would also encourage the very rich to hide income above $10 million.) A better way to extract money from top earners would be to get rid of the loopholes, deductions, and exemptions they use to shelter income from taxation in the first place, economists said. \u201cBroadening the tax base is generally more efficient than changing rates,\u201d said Kyle Pomerleau of the Tax Foundation, a think tank in Washington, D.C. \u201cThat would include getting at what I would call the Big Three, which is the charitable deduction, the home-mortgage-interest deduction, and the state- and local-tax deduction.\u201d Derek Thompson: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has the better tax argument The charitable deduction allows very high earners to spend on nonprofit causes that they find interesting and valuable, as opposed to turning that money over to Uncle Sam for what the broad public wants and needs. (As the Trump Foundation so extravagantly shows, such charitable largesse is often anything but.) The home-mortgage-interest deduction prompts the rich to buy even fancier houses than they could otherwise afford. And the state and local deduction reduces the tax bills of rich families who happen to live in high-tax states. Together, the Big Three cost the government something like $100 billion a year. Eliminating these deductions would not just raise more money, but also reduce distortions in the economy, experts think: The government would no longer nudge billionaires to spend extravagantly on big houses or concert halls or hospital naming rights, or subsidize the cost of living in New York or California. There\u2019s a whole slew of other deductions and exclusions, such as provisions for the owners of corporate jets, that the government would do well to erase, too. There\u2019s also a strong case for raising the country\u2019s preferential, low tax rates on dividends and capital gains and getting rid of the carried-interest loophole\u2014provisions that cost the government about $130 billion a year. Right now investors pay a top rate of 23.8 percent on long-term-investment earnings, versus 37 percent on ordinary income. The argument for keeping that rate low is that it encourages investment. But the carried-interest loophole is a straightforward tax dodge for hedge-fund managers. Investment income is income and should be taxed more like regular income, many tax experts think. As for Warren\u2019s wealth tax, that proposal comes from two of the world\u2019s preeminent scholars on inequality, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley. (The former is in part responsible for much of the data showing the rise in income inequality in the United States; the latter literally wrote the book on the role of tax evasion in widening inequality.) Their wealth tax would raise an estimated 1 percent of GDP a year, or about $200 billion. Read: How America\u2019s vision of progressive tax reform died \u201cThe main argument is that an annual progressive wealth tax is the most direct way to limit the increase in wealth concentration,\u201d Zucman told me. \u201cThe wealth share of the top 0.1 percent has increased from 7 percent in 1980 to about 20 percent today. The wealth tax is the most powerful tool to catalyze wealth concentration\u2014depending on the rate, to limit its increase or to make it shrink.\u201d He added that a wealth tax would also \u201cenable the government to tax people who have a lot of wealth, not a lot of income,\u201d such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon. His 2017 salary: $81,840. His net worth: $135 billion or so, depending on the state of the stock market. With a wealth tax, very high-net-worth individuals would tally up the value of their estates\u2014property, racehorses, art, business holdings, licensing fees, you name it\u2014and pay a small share of that sum to the government annually; the government could use land, investment, and asset registers, as well as audits, to ensure compliance. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that there are no exemptions,\u201d so that the rich do not just shift assets around into classes that are not counted, Zucman told me. Still, tax experts said the wealth tax would be difficult for the government to administer. \u201cIf we all had all of our wealth in publicly traded securities, it would be easy, but we don\u2019t, and that\u2019s what makes it hard,\u201d Mazur said. \u201cPeople hold a lot of wealth in closely held businesses, like a car dealership or a ranching operation, or in partnerships that trade assets, like hedge funds. Those things are hard to value. What a wealth tax does is have the government say, \u2018Rich people, raise your hands and tell us what your wealth is!\u2019 They\u2019re probably not going to give you a good answer.\u201d There might be other ways to get at the same pool of people and the same pool of wealth without asking so much of the Internal Revenue Service. Pomerleau said the government might focus on taxing events where wealth changes hands, rather than assessing and taxing 75,000 people\u2019s net worth each year. \u201cIt is easier to tax a transaction or transfer than an asset\u2014there\u2019s a market, and transactions are tracked,\u201d he said. One option would be to jack up the estate tax, as Sanders wants to do, in essence creating a big, one-off wealth tax on the rich people who happen to die in a given year. Financial-transaction taxes would also hit the same pocket of very wealthy Americans. The minutiae of Warren\u2019s, Sanders\u2019s, and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposals aside, the tax code is riddled with provisions that let the richest Americans accumulate vast pools of wealth, worsening inequality and even fraying the country\u2019s very democracy. There are better ways and worse ways to extract money from the rich, but Democrats have a strong argument that one way or another, the government ought to soak the rich.

Nearly two dozen states, cities and local municipalities will see some form of a minimum wage hike go into effect July 1, according to a report by the worker advocacy group\u00a0National Employment Law Project. Jan. 1, 2025 marked a popular day for pay increases across the U.S., as 21 states and 48 cities raised their minimum wage rates. In total, 88 jurisdictions across 23 states were set to see minimum wage hikes by the end of 2025, the report said. Some of these July 1 increases pertain only to certain sectors, like California's wage hike for health care sector workers, or are part of a multi-step plan, like in Alaska, where wages will increase each year until reaching $15 an hour by 2027. It's estimated more than 880,000 workers in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C. will start earning a higher minimum wage starting July 1, according to a new report by economic policy think tank Economic Policy Institute. Here's where the increases are slated to take effect beginning July 1, 2025. Some local jurisdictions adjust their minimum wages annually for inflation each July, according to a June report by ADP. The changes often result in marginal increases in hourly rates that are less than a dollar. Several pertain only to workers in a specific sector or to businesses of a certain size. New wages effective July 1 include: Elsewhere in the country, Maryland's Montgomery County will raise pay to $15.50, $16 or $17.65 per hour, depending on the amount of employees, coming out to about a 50 cent raise.

    "text": "Minimum wage hikes traditionally have been aimed at helping low-paid workers afford the basics, such as food, medicine and housing. But a growing number of states and localities are raising their pay floors to $15 an hour or above, providing workers a somewhat larger financial cushion so they can not only pay for essentials with less of a struggle but also make some discretionary purchases.\u00a0 Twenty-one states and 48 cities and counties are set to raise their minimum wages on Jan. 1, according to a report provided exclusively to USA TODAY by the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. Other states and a few more cities and counties will raise their minimum wages later in 2025. While the pay floor bumps mark an annual ritual, the report highlights an acceleration in the size of minimum wage increases in recent years. On New Year\u2019s Day, three states \u2013 Illinois, Delaware and Rhode Island \u2013 will reach a $15 pay base for the first time, joining seven states already there or above it. Two states, California and New Jersey, are set to push their pay floors further above $17 for some health care workers. Meanwhile, 47 localities will also reach or top $15 on Jan. 1, including more than two dozen in California, most of which will climb further above $17. Burien, Washington, already subject to the state\u2019s $16.28 minimum pay, will vault to $21.16 for employers with 500 or more workers in King County, making it the nation\u2019s highest pay floor. \u201cRemember that a full-time worker earning $17 per hour is only earning $35,360 annually pretax,\u201d Yannet Lathrop, NELP\u2019s senior researcher and policy analyst, wrote in an email. \u201cThose wage levels won\u2019t make workers wealthy, but they will help with paying for the basics, for a few luxuries (hopefully).\" She added, \u201cThose higher wages may also improve their mental and physical health, their ability to access credit, and may lead to better educational outcomes of their children.\u201d In January, several states will take a step in a series of minimum wage hikes over several years. Among the three hitting $15 for the first time, Illinois and Rhode Island are at $14 and Delaware is at $13.25. Others are increasing their minimums, but stopping short of $15. Missouri\u2019s base pay will jump to $13.75 from $12.30 and Nebraska\u2019s to $13.50 from $12. Kaamilya Hobbs, 33, of Kansas City, Missouri, earns $13.44 an hour working 20 to 25 hours at a local Arby\u2019s. Her boyfriend mostly cares for their three children, a newborn and two toddlers, but sometimes does food delivery for DoorDash. Their combined pay is barely enough to pay basic expenses. Sometimes, the couple has to delay paying rent or a cellphone bill for 30 days. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit tricky,\u201d Hobbs said. \u00a0\u201cAfter rent and food and expenses for the kids, we don\u2019t have too much left over to be able to do anything day to day.\u201d Missouri\u2019s minimum wage increase to $13.75 \u201cwould help a little,\u201d she said. The family might have to juggle bill payments less often. Plus, she said, \u201cI\u2019d be able to visit my mom more often.\u201d Now, she rarely visits her mother, who lives about 25 miles away, because of the gasoline cost. But Hobbs said she\u2019s hoping for additional minimum wage hikes. \u201cThe cost of living is still going to be going up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t live on $13.75.\u201d Many states \u2013 including Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Ohio and Virginia \u2013 are imposing smaller base pay rises linked to annual increases in the cost of living based on the consumer price index. Later in 2025, a handful of states and a couple dozen localities will also boost their minimum wages. The upshot: A total of 23 states and 65 cities and counties \u2013 a record 88 jurisdictions \u2013 will lift their pay floors sometime next year. The increases will directly affect 3 million workers earning minimum wage and indirectly nudge up pay for 6.2 million higher-paid employees because of ripple effects on company pay structures, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. What stands out, though, is the growing contingent of states at $15 an hour or higher. New York, California, Massachusetts, Washington, Maryland, New Jersey and Connecticut are already there. And besides the three joining that faction on New Year\u2019s Day, Oregon will get there in July because of a cost-of-living rise. Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Missouri and Nebraska will hit the $15 benchmark by 2026 or 2027. That makes 16 states with nearly half the U.S. workforce in states with pay floors of $15 or higher within the next three years, according to the National Employment Law Project and the Economic Policy Institute. \u201cFifteen dollars is still the target rate,\u201d Lathrop said. \u201cIt\u2019s now the competitive rate.\u201d Minimum wage increases in the past few years have helped Americans keep pace with annual inflation that reached a 40-year high of 9.1% in mid-2022 before gradually falling to 2.6% recently. As a result of the laws, \u201cWorkers and their families don\u2019t have to choose which bills to pay,\u201d Lathrop said. Yet none of the planned wage floors would meet the threshold of a \u201cliving wage\u201d that would allow workers to afford basics such as food, child care, health care, housing, transportation, broadband, and other necessities, Lathrop said. In King County, Washington, for example, the minimum wage is poised to rise to $20.29 on Jan. 1. But the living wage for an adult with no children in the county is $30.08, according to the MIT Living Wage Calculator. Michael Saltsman, managing director of the Employment Policies Institute, which is backed by the restaurant industry, noted that at least some minimum wage workers aren't financially squeezed because they live in households with higher total incomes. The $15 threshold was deemed a pipe dream when Fight for $15, an alliance of fast-food and other low-paid workers, began demanding it in walkouts across the nation starting in 2012. On April 1, however, the minimum hourly wage for fast-food workers in California leaped from $4 to $20, pushing it well above the state's standard $16 pay threshold. Meanwhile, the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009, with Republicans in Congress repeatedly blocking efforts to raise it. About 30 states with more than 60% of the U.S. workforce have higher pay floors than the federal government\u2019s. Lathrop, though, says the issue transcends politics. This year, Alaska and Missouri, both Republican-dominated states, became the latest to pass ballot initiatives raising the minimum wage to $15 over the next few years. Saltsman, for his part, noted that voters in California and Massachusetts, two predominantly Democratic states, this year rejected proposals to raise the minimum wage for specific groups of workers. \u201cThey\u2019re associated with higher prices and loss of jobs,\u201d he said of the pay increases. Restaurants, he said, have passed along their higher labor costs to consumers by raising food prices. And the wage hikes have forced many eateries to close or lay off workers, he said. Various studies have supported both sides of the debate. Analyses by the University of California, Berkeley, and the National Bureau of Economic Research found that pay increases didn\u2019t cause job losses within low-wage industries but did lead to some reduced employment among teens and other low-skilled workers. In 2021, a Congressional Budget Office report concluded that boosting the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would raise incomes for millions of Americans and lift 900,000 people out of poverty but reduce employment by about 1.4 million workers within a few years. Economist Dante DeAntonio of Moody\u2019s Analytics said the minimum pay increases haven\u2019t had a noticeable effect on inflation, in part, because the share of workers at or below the pay floors is small. State minimum wage hikes each January have contributed to sharper inflation early in the year but haven\u2019t moved the needle on overall price increases in the months that followed, said Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist of Oxford Economics.",

While the pay floor bumps mark an annual ritual, the report highlights an acceleration in the size of minimum wage increases in recent years.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Day, three states \u2013 Illinois, Delaware and Rhode Island \u2013 will reach a $15 pay base for the first time, joining seven states already there or above it. Two states, California and New Jersey, are set to push their pay floors further above $17 for some health care workers. Meanwhile, 47 localities will also reach or top $15 on Jan. 1, including more than two dozen in California, most of which will climb further above $17. Burien, Washington, already subject to the state\u2019s $16.28 minimum pay, will vault to $21.16 for employers with 500 or more workers in King County, making it the nation\u2019s highest pay floor.\n\n\u201cRemember that a full-time worker earning $17 per hour is only earning $35,360 annually pretax,\u201d Yannet Lathrop, NELP\u2019s senior researcher and policy analyst, wrote in an email. \u201cThose wage levels won\u2019t make workers wealthy, but they will help with paying for the basics, for a few luxuries (hopefully).\" She added, \u201cThose higher wages may also improve their mental and physical health, their ability to access credit, and may lead to better educational outcomes of their children.\u201d\n\nIn January, several states will take a step in a series of minimum wage hikes over several years. Among the three hitting $15 for the first time, Illinois and Rhode Island are at $14 and Delaware is at $13.25. Others are increasing their minimums, but stopping short of $15. Missouri\u2019s base pay will jump to $13.75 from $12.30 and Nebraska\u2019s to $13.50 from $12.\n\nKaamilya Hobbs, 33, of Kansas City, Missouri, earns $13.44 an hour working 20 to 25 hours at a local Arby\u2019s. Her boyfriend mostly cares for their three children, a newborn and two toddlers, but sometimes does food delivery for DoorDash. Their combined pay is barely enough to pay basic expenses. Sometimes, the couple has to delay paying rent or a cellphone bill for 30 days. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit tricky,\u201d Hobbs said.  \u201cAfter rent and food and expenses for the kids, we don\u2019t have too much left over to be able to do anything day to day.\u201d Missouri\u2019s minimum wage increase to $13.75 \u201cwould help a little,\u201d she said. The family might have to juggle bill payments less often. Plus, she said, \u201cI\u2019d be able to visit my mom more often.\u201d Now, she rarely visits her mother, who lives about 25 miles away, because of the gasoline cost. But Hobbs said she\u2019s hoping for additional minimum wage hikes. \u201cThe cost of living is still going to be going up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t live on $13.75.\u201d\n\nMany states \u2013 including Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Ohio and Virginia \u2013 are imposing smaller base pay rises linked to annual increases in the cost of living based on the consumer price index. Later in 2025, a handful of states and a couple dozen localities will also boost their minimum wages. The upshot: A total of 23 states and 65 cities and counties \u2013 a record 88 jurisdictions \u2013 will lift their pay floors sometime next year. The increases will directly affect 3 million workers earning minimum wage and indirectly nudge up pay for 6.2 million higher-paid employees because of ripple effects on company pay structures, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\n\nWhat stands out, though, is the growing contingent of states at $15 an hour or higher. New York, California, Massachusetts, Washington, Maryland, New Jersey and Connecticut are already there. And besides the three joining that faction on New Year\u2019s Day, Oregon will get there in July because of a cost-of-living rise. Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Missouri and Nebraska will hit the $15 benchmark by 2026 or 2027. That makes 16 states with nearly half the U.S. workforce in states with pay floors of $15 or higher within the next three years, according to the National Employment Law Project and the Economic Policy Institute.\n\n\u201cFifteen dollars is still the target rate,\u201d Lathrop said. \u201cIt\u2019s now the competitive rate.\u201d Minimum wage increases in the past few years have helped Americans keep pace with annual inflation that reached a 40-year high of 9.1% in mid-2022 before gradually falling to 2.6% recently. As a result of the laws, \u201cWorkers and their families don\u2019t have to choose which bills to pay,\u201d Lathrop said.\n\nYet none of the planned wage floors would meet the threshold of a \u201cliving wage\u201d that would allow workers to afford basics such as food, child care, health care, housing, transportation, broadband, and other necessities, Lathrop said. In King County, Washington, for example, the minimum wage is poised to rise to $20.29 on Jan. 1. But the living wage for an adult with no children in the county is $30.08, according to the MIT Living Wage Calculator.\n\nMichael Saltsman, managing director of the Employment Policies Institute, which is backed by the restaurant industry, noted that at least some minimum wage workers aren't financially squeezed because they live in households with higher total incomes.\n\nThe $15 threshold was deemed a pipe dream when Fight for $15, an alliance of fast-food and other low-paid workers, began demanding it in walkouts across the nation starting in 2012. On April 1, however, the minimum hourly wage for fast-food workers in California leaped from $4 to $20, pushing it well above the state's standard $16 pay threshold.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009, with Republicans in Congress repeatedly blocking efforts to raise it. About 30 states with more than 60% of the U.S. workforce have higher pay floors than the federal government\u2019s.\n\nLathrop, though, says the issue transcends politics. This year, Alaska and Missouri, both Republican-dominated states, became the latest to pass ballot initiatives raising the minimum wage to $15 over the next few years.\n\nSaltsman, for his part, noted that voters in California and Massachusetts, two predominantly Democratic states, this year rejected proposals to raise the minimum wage for specific groups of workers. \u201cThey\u2019re associated with higher prices and loss of jobs,\u201d he said of the pay increases. Restaurants, he said, have passed along their higher labor costs to consumers by raising food prices. And the wage hikes have forced many eateries to close or lay off workers, he said.\n\nVarious studies have supported both sides of the debate. Analyses by the University of California, Berkeley, and the National Bureau of Economic Research found that pay increases didn\u2019t cause job losses within low-wage industries but did lead to some reduced employment among teens and other low-skilled workers. In 2021, a Congressional Budget Office report concluded that boosting the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would raise incomes for millions of Americans and lift 900,000 people out of poverty but reduce employment by about 1.4 million workers within a few years.\n\nEconomist Dante DeAntonio of Moody\u2019s Analytics said the minimum pay increases haven\u2019t had a noticeable effect on inflation, in part, because the share of workers at or below the pay floors is small. State minimum wage hikes each January have contributed to sharper inflation early in the year but haven\u2019t moved the needle on overall price increases in the months that followed, said Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist of Oxford Economics.",

    "text": "Published Jul 29, 2025 at 05:00 AM EDT U.S. News Reporter Universal or guaranteed basic income programs are gaining momentum across the country, as local governments and nonprofits experiment with the bold new alternative to traditional welfare models. According to Stanford University's Basic Income Lab, which tracks ongoing UBI or GBI pilot programs across the U.S., citizens in 18 states, as well as the District of Columbia, have taken part in some form of basic income study this year. \"UBI differs quite radically from welfare as we know it because it goes to all without means tests or work requirements,\" said Juliana Bidadanure, founder of the Basic Income Lab. \"It builds a robust floor that prevents all from falling too low, and it achieves that with a principle of radical inclusivity (everyone is opted in automatically).\" Neither UBI nor GBI programs have yet become a nationwide practice in any country, and their implementation will continue to be hindered by political and fiscal concerns some governments may have over providing citizens with unconditional payments. However, the studies that have been conducted have provided important data on the benefits and drawbacks of income guarantees for citizens, and could lead to further adoption in the future. Given that economies across the globe are faced with mounting inequality and the prospects of automation depriving millions of working opportunities, advocates believe that providing a basic income is an increasingly necessary means of ensuring financial security in the face of rapid economic shifts. According to the Stanford Basic Income Lab's tracker, 57 basic income experiments were ongoing as of late January, with over a dozen in California alone. While many have concluded, others remain ongoing, varying in payment amounts, recipients and intended purposes. One such experiment is currently being conducted by the Southern California non-profit Inland SoCal United Way in conjunction with the California Department of Social Services. The pilot program will provide unconditional cash payments of $600 per month for 18 months to hundreds of pregnant women in their first or second trimesters, as well as $750 per month to 21-year-olds who have spent time in the foster care system. Another is the Richmond Resilience Initiative, operated by the city's government and now in its fifth year, which focuses on providing support to those who serve as their household's primary caregiver. Participants receive $500 per month for a period of two years, and it is aimed at \"reducing financial instability for working families.\" Canadian health economist and basic income scholar Evelyn Forget told Newsweek that current welfare programs are plagued with bureaucratic obstacles and inefficiencies, issues she believes are made easier by an unconditional payment system like UBI. \"In North America, we have a range of social programs \u2014 most underfunded and virtually all 'conditional,'\" she said. \"These conditions, on their face, seem reasonable... In practice, many of these conditions are imposed in ways that make access to cash difficult: How do you 'prove' residency when you have no ID? How do you 'prove' an episodic mental illness? How do you access child support when you're the grandmother caring for the kids but their parents, who may be unreachable, have custody?\" Amy Castro, co-founder of the Center for Guaranteed Income Research at the University of Pennsylvania, said that the heightened interest in unconditional cash programs has been driven by \"pervasive economic strain.\" \"Americans are working more and making less to the detriment of our health, well-being, and relationships,\" she said. \"Living with chronic financial stress like not knowing if you will receive enough shifts at work to make rent drives poor public health outcomes, food insecurity and a range of mental health stressors.\" Castro added that the benefit of such programs is that cash \"is provided with no strings attached, no conditions on how the money can be spent,\" and that this can work alongside existing social safety nets. Based on data from over 30 basic income pilots across the U.S., the Stanford Basic Income Lab tracked how Americans spent the money they received through these programs. The majority of expenditures went toward retail sales and services. Food and groceries were the second-highest at 32 percent, followed by transport and housing/utilities, both at 9 percent. Juliana Bidadanure, founder of the Stanford Basic Income Lab, told Newsweek that a system of simple, unconditional payments \"suppresses bureaucratically burdensome eligibility tests and protects individuals in poverty from being subject to the discretionary power of state agents. It implements a real right to live free from abject poverty, no questions asked, no paperwork filed.\" \"The universal feature of UBI also makes it harder to demonize or stigmatize those on benefits,\" she added. \"This is important since a common feature of Western countries with targeted cash payment has been the stigmatization of benefits recipients as scroungers and welfare queens.\" Danny Avula, Mayor of Richmond, Virginia, upon launching the fifth Resilience Initiative basic income pilot, said: \"In Richmond, we believe everyone has a right to thrive, not just survive. The Richmond Resilience Initiative reflects our ongoing commitment to creating a city where families have the stability and support they need to build a better future.\" Amy Castro, co-founder of the Center for Guaranteed Income Research, told Newsweek: \"The advantage of cash is that it is flexible, fungible, and efficient\u2014particularly when enduring an unexpected economic shock like a natural disaster or sudden drop in the market. Traditional safety net benefits like WIC, SNAP or housing supports require constant administrative recertification and are plagued by the benefits cliff where working families are penalized for every dollar they make above the income threshold.\" \"People spend tremendous amounts of time and cognitive bandwidth negotiating these cliffs to make sure they don't lose benefits crucial for surviving a risky economy,\" she added. \"This traps people at the poverty line because they must choose between a raise at work or an extra shift and potentially losing their benefits.\" \u00a9 2025 Newsweek Digital LLC",

    "title": "DOGE slashes key housing inspection contract, putting some low-income families at risk",
    "domain": "abcnews.go.com",
    "text": "Experts warn that the cuts may harm vulnerable Americans. A contract to inspect low-income and other assisted housing for gas leaks, faulty smoke detectors and other life-threatening deficiencies was terminated by the Trump administration in February as part of its cost-cutting efforts, according to a Department of Government Efficiency database, potentially leaving thousands of vulnerable Americans in harm's way. Tom Feehan, a veteran home inspector who lost work as part of the termination, told ABC News that these legally required inspections frequently uncover painted-over ceiling sprinklers, defective gas ranges and any number of home-related liabilities that can pose a danger to occupants. \"By not doing [the inspections], we're not catching those,\" Feehan said. \"So those are not being repaired, and it's putting people at risk.\" Last year, the contractor, Project Solutions Inc., in its third year of working with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, was assigned to inspect roughly 6,200 public housing and multifamily properties across the country over the course of 12 months. In addition to flagging dangerous conditions, the inspections ensure that tenants have hot and cold water, safe electrical outlets, and working heating and cooling systems, experts said. A HUD official told ABC News that the contract was for \"software modification,\" despite Project Solutions identifying the contract as being for inspection services. The HUD official declined to elaborate on the reason behind the contract's termination. The sudden termination threatens thousands of inspections, according to Robin Miller, a contract manager at Project Solutions, including those at roughly 250 \"priority\" properties, where inspections were already delayed or significant deficiencies were found during previous inspections. Project Solution's contract termination was among more than 7,000 federal contracts canceled by DOGE and posted to the agency's \"Wall of Receipts\" web page in recent weeks. The DOGE site claimed that terminating the inspection contract would return $285 million to taxpayers. But Miller, the Project Solutions official, said that figure was inflated because it was based on a high estimated ceiling value that wasn't reflective of what the contract would actually cost. According to federal spending records, HUD had only awarded Project Solutions roughly $29 million so far. Experts said it was unclear how housing officials planned to carry out the outstanding inspections. HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett said in a statement that \"HUD is reviewing all contracts for efficiency and effectiveness to accomplish good government goals,\" and that \"certain contracts were found not to accomplish HUD's mission with economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.\" Industry experts said that the inspections, which are required by law, will likely fall to other contractors at a similar price. But arranging those inspections will take time, experts said, and delaying inspections compounds the risks for tenants. \"We're helping low-income people and we're helping senior citizens maintain a safe, livable environment,\" Feehan said. \"And with not getting these inspections done on time, it's hurting them.\" Another HUD-certified inspector based in Illinois, who asked that their name not be used so they could speak freely about their field of work, told ABC News that one of the properties that was scheduled to be inspected until the Project Solutions contract was canceled was a 24-unit multifamily property that had received far below the \"failing\" score, meaning significant deficiencies were found during its previous inspection and the property needed more frequent inspections. The property was already past due its Dec. 13, 2024, inspection date, and its inspection has yet to be rescheduled, the inspector said. Project Solutions was one of at least three contractors that were hired to inspect HUD-insured and assisted properties under the agency's Real Estate Assessment Center program, which is aimed at \"improving housing quality by performing accurate, credible, and reliable assessments\" of its properties. \"I 100% agree that all governments, all organizations, businesses, even personal family units, should routinely review budget and spending habits and cut things out that are not necessary,\" the Illinois inspector said. \"Get rid of the fraud, waste abuse -- but you have to be responsible about it.\" \"If it wasn't for DOGE, we'd still be doing the contract. That's my opinion,\" Feehan said. \"DOGE is trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse. I didn't see where there was waste fraud and abuse with PSI.\" Alia Trindle, co-director of political strategy at housing advocacy group Right to the City Alliance, stressed that many HUD-funded buildings have been in dire shape for decades due to past funding cuts. She said for some properties, tenants and advocates have had to organize to push for basic repairs after years of neglect. \"Working-class and poor communities have to contend with substandard and neglected housing that could have devastating long-term health consequences for those that live there, from mold to pest to a lack of access to basic utilities like water and heat,\" Trindle said. \"So regular inspections, whether done by HUD or HUD-affiliated groups or by municipalities, are critical to ensuring that those who are responsible for this housing stock do the bare minimum to maintain them,\" she said.

    "onlytext": "Experts warn that the cuts may harm vulnerable Americans. A contract to inspect low-income and other assisted housing for gas leaks, faulty smoke detectors and other life-threatening deficiencies was terminated by the Trump administration in February as part of its cost-cutting efforts, according to a Department of Government Efficiency database, potentially leaving thousands of vulnerable Americans in harm's way. Tom Feehan, a veteran home inspector who lost work as part of the termination, told ABC News that these legally required inspections frequently uncover painted-over ceiling sprinklers, defective gas ranges and any number of home-related liabilities that can pose a danger to occupants. \"By not doing [the inspections], we're not catching those,\" Feehan said. \"So those are not being repaired, and it's putting people at risk.\" Last year, the contractor, Project Solutions Inc., in its third year of working with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, was assigned to inspect roughly 6,200 public housing and multifamily properties across the country over the course of 12 months. In addition to flagging dangerous conditions, the inspections ensure that tenants have hot and cold water, safe electrical outlets, and working heating and cooling systems, experts said. A HUD official told ABC News that the contract was for \"software modification,\" despite Project Solutions identifying the contract as being for inspection services. The HUD official declined to elaborate on the reason behind the contract's termination. The sudden termination threatens thousands of inspections, according to Robin Miller, a contract manager at Project Solutions, including those at roughly 250 \"priority\" properties, where inspections were already delayed or significant deficiencies were found during previous inspections. Project Solution's contract termination was among more than 7,000 federal contracts canceled by DOGE and posted to the agency's \"Wall of Receipts\" web page in recent weeks. The DOGE site claimed that terminating the inspection contract would return $285 million to taxpayers. But Miller, the Project Solutions official, said that figure was inflated because it was based on a high estimated ceiling value that wasn't reflective of what the contract would actually cost. According to federal spending records, HUD had only awarded Project Solutions roughly $29 million so far. Experts said it was unclear how housing officials planned to carry out the outstanding inspections. HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett said in a statement that \"HUD is reviewing all contracts for efficiency and effectiveness to accomplish good government goals,\" and that \"certain contracts were found not to accomplish HUD's mission with economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.\" Industry experts said that the inspections, which are required by law, will likely fall to other contractors at a similar price. But arranging those inspections will take time, experts said, and delaying inspections compounds the risks for tenants. \"We're helping low-income people and we're helping senior citizens maintain a safe, livable environment,\" Feehan said. \"And with not getting these inspections done on time, it's hurting them.\" Another HUD-certified inspector based in Illinois, who asked that their name not be used so they could speak freely about their field of work, told ABC News that one of the properties that was scheduled to be inspected until the Project Solutions contract was canceled was a 24-unit multifamily property that had received far below the \"failing\" score, meaning significant deficiencies were found during its previous inspection and the property needed more frequent inspections. The property was already past due its Dec. 13, 2024, inspection date, and its inspection has yet to be rescheduled, the inspector said. Project Solutions was one of at least three contractors that were hired to inspect HUD-insured and assisted properties under the agency's Real Estate Assessment Center program, which is aimed at \"improving housing quality by performing accurate, credible, and reliable assessments\" of its properties. \"I 100% agree that all governments, all organizations, businesses, even personal family units, should routinely review budget and spending habits and cut things out that are not necessary,\" the Illinois inspector said. \"Get rid of the fraud, waste abuse -- but you have to be responsible about it.\" \"If it wasn't for DOGE, we'd still be doing the contract. That's my opinion,\" Feehan said. \"DOGE is trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse. I didn't see where there was waste fraud and abuse with PSI.\" Alia Trindle, co-director of political strategy at housing advocacy group Right to the City Alliance, stressed that many HUD-funded buildings have been in dire shape for decades due to past funding cuts. She said for some properties, tenants and advocates have had to organize to push for basic repairs after years of neglect. \"Working-class and poor communities have to contend with substandard and neglected housing that could have devastating long-term health consequences for those that live there, from mold to pest to a lack of access to basic utilities like water and heat,\" Trindle said. \"So regular inspections, whether done by HUD or HUD-affiliated groups or by municipalities, are critical to ensuring that those who are responsible for this housing stock do the bare minimum to maintain them,\" she said.

Mar\u00eda Lara and her 10-year-old daughter, Ashley, live in Langley Park, Md., a densely populated, low-income suburb of Washington, D.C. She says the worst part about living in the Bedford and Victoria Station complex, a multifamily residential property, is that she and her daughter don't feel safe. \"These apartments are rotten,\" Lara says, because the place is \"roach- and mice-infested, water leaks everywhere, [the] walls have holes and pipes are exposed.\" Her kitchen floors are buckling, and Lara can see down to her neighbor's first-floor apartment. \"I feel like the ceiling is going to collapse on us or we are going to fall on my neighbor below us,\" the 44-year-old native of El Salvador says. Ashley worries about being bitten by bedbugs or rodents at night. \"Sometimes my daughter wakes up in the middle of the night when she hears rats and mice roaming around,\" Lara says, fighting back tears.

The company's business strategy, the complaint alleges, involves the \"intentional targeting of these low-income communities of color.\" \"Basic maintenance and necessary repairs to both properties have been ignored and neglected to the point that the exclusively minority families living in them are forced to live in conditions that belie expected housing conditions in the region,\" the complaint states. CASA de Maryland, an immigrant advocacy organization headquartered in Hyattsville, Md., organized the tenants for months and is also a plaintiff in the case. \"The conditions at the BVS [Bedford and Victoria Station] properties, deteriorating in real time around the families living in them, would shock the conscience of most Marylanders and others living only a short distance away,\" according to the complaint. \n                Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez says that the landlord recently repainted his bathroom after a drawn-out dispute.\n                \n                    \n                    Ian Morton/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n The Bedford and Victoria Station complex is managed by Ross Companies, a defendant in the class action.

We speak with our residents.\" NPR reached out to Arbor Realty Trust but got no response to requests for comment. According to the complaint, the company owns \"over 8,000 units and has acquired more than $1.75 billion of multifamily properties across the country.\" Like many immigrants, Lara says crushing poverty pushed her to migrate to the Washington area in 2006. She thought life in the U.S. would be easier, but it has been a struggle. Ashley's father abandoned them when Lara was expecting the baby. Lara works in construction, cleaning and prepping materials \u2014 work that isn't always reliable. The coronavirus pandemic severely cut her work hours to less than half. Lara has lived in the Bedford and Victoria Station complex since 2009, and though Lara says management has neglected the units for a long time, she says that the pandemic lockdown seems to have emboldened her landlord.

It's not easy for people to get up and move.\" A 2019 study published in the American Journal of Sociology explored the burden of housing costs on low-income renters in urban neighborhoods, landlord exploitation and the high profit margins gained by landlords that own properties in those areas. \n                Top: The front door to Mar\u00eda Lara's apartment is broken.

Arbor Realty Trust Inc., a publicly traded company, has a duty to ensure profits for its shareholders, he says, but it also has duties to its tenants under the law. \"They need to provide safe homes,\" Donahue says.

He adds that his community was heavily affected by the pandemic, with many losing jobs and unable to pay rent or buy food. \"Hunger and need pushed us to sue the landlord \u2014 to say enough. We have never asked for free housing. What we ask for is fair housing conditions.\" The Bedford and Victoria Station complex houses 589 units, built in the 1940s \"and never significantly renovated,\" according to the complaint, which alleges that living conditions for families have worsened because repairs, rodent infestation and toxic mold have been neglected. The complaint asks the court to certify the lawsuit as a class action on behalf of all tenants. Donahue, the attorney, says he hopes the litigation sheds light on the practices of investors that, he says, take advantage of low-income, multifamily residential properties such as the one in Langley Park. \"There's a lot of companies that own properties like this, and they don't fix them and they squeeze the properties for rent,\" he says. \"This needs to stop.\"",

You are free to republish it so long as you do the following:\t Co-published with The Times-Picayune | The Advocate and WWL-TV This article was produced for ProPublica\u2019s Local Reporting Network in partnership with The Times-Picayune | The Advocate and WWL-TV. Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published. The complaints started as soon as Louisiana launched its massive program to help homeowners rebuild after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Community leaders said the largest rebuilding program in U.S. history would be unfair to the state\u2019s poorest residents. Activists and real estate experts spoke out at meetings of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which designed and ran the Road Home program. An attorney representing poor homeowners testified before Congress. A fair housing group sued the state and federal governments. State officials made tweaks and settled the lawsuit, but they never changed a core part of the formula that determined how much homeowners received. Now a groundbreaking analysis of nearly 92,000 rebuilding grants statewide shows critics were right all along: Road Home shortchanged people in poor neighborhoods while giving those in wealthy neighborhoods more of what they needed. People in the most impoverished areas in New Orleans \u2014 those with a median income of $15,000 or less \u2014 had to cover 30% of their rebuilding costs after Road Home grants, Federal Emergency Management Agency aid and insurance. In areas where the median income was more than $75,000, the shortfall was 20%, according to the analysis by ProPublica, The Times-Picayune | The Advocate and WWL-TV. Median household income Damage left uncovered for all properties in each income group 30% <$15K $15-30K 27% 25% $30-45K $45-60K 23% 23% $60-75K >$75K 20% Poverty tracks closely with race in New Orleans, so the shortfalls in the city disproportionately hurt Black people. Road Home also underpaid residents of St. Bernard Parish, a mostly white, working-class community devastated by the hurricane. Had properties in the lowest-income parts of New Orleans been covered at the same rate as the wealthiest, each of those households would have received about $18,000 more on average. Across the city, covering all homeowners\u2019 repair costs at the rate of the highest earners would have resulted in another $349 million for rebuilding. The Road Home program was hugely consequential for Louisiana, and much more so for its largest city, most of which flooded after Katrina\u2019s storm surge overwhelmed its levees. Most homeowners didn\u2019t have adequate insurance. Facing the possibility of a mass exodus, state leaders devised Road Home to cover the gap and encourage people to rebuild. Road Home also allowed homeowners to sell their property to the state and move elsewhere, though housing was scarce in the region. If homeowners didn\u2019t stay in Louisiana, they forfeited 40% of their home\u2019s value. New Orleans was the biggest beneficiary of rebuilding grants, and half of all owner-occupied homes in New Orleans received rebuilding grants, with $3.3 billion awarded citywide. Some neighborhoods rebounded quickly. Others languished. Housing advocates say that\u2019s due to the original sin of the Road Home program: It calculated each grant based on a home\u2019s value before the hurricane or on the cost of repairs \u2014 whichever was less. The value of most homes in poor areas was lower than the cost of rebuilding them, so the resulting grants didn\u2019t cover all repairs. But for most people in affluent areas, the rebuilding cost was lower than the value of their homes. They got grants that came closer to covering their needs. \u201cThe practical effects of how this program shaped the city can still be seen today,\u201d said Davida Finger, an attorney who testified to Congress in 2009 about unfairness in the Road Home program. Poor New Orleanians had a much harder time covering the costs. For a homeowner in the lowest-income areas, it would have taken more than 43 months at the average annual salary to pay the cost of repairs not covered by Road Home, FEMA and insurance, the news outlets found. In the highest-income areas, it would have taken less than eight months. The shortcomings in the Road Home program are part of a broader tapestry of failures in the ways America helps people affected by catastrophes. A yearlong investigation by ProPublica, The Times-Picayune | The Advocate and WWL-TV has found that disaster programs often shortchange the people who need it most, worsening inequities in the wake of disaster. Finger said the news organizations\u2019 findings were \u201cshocking but not surprising.\u201d \u201cWhat Black homeowners, what lawyers, what advocates, what community organizers, what reporters were telling the program designers all along was completely accurate,\u201d Finger said. \u201cThey simply didn\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d The state Office of Community Development took issue with the analysis, but none of the points it raised affected the news organizations\u2019 findings. Two officials who were in charge of the recovery told the news outlets that the findings were troubling. Andy Kopplin, the first executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, stressed that state officials took pains to steer more money to poorer homeowners through a second grant program. But Kopplin acknowledged in a written statement that the findings show that low- and middle-income households should\u2019ve received more. That\u2019s \u201cupsetting to those of us who were working to create more equitable outcomes and especially to those families who needed and deserved more resources for their recovery,\u201d he wrote. Walter Leger, who was a key board member of the LRA, said the findings should spur the state to seek more federal aid from Congress to fill the gaps. De\u2019Marcus Finnell, deputy press secretary for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, declined to address the findings directly. But in a statement he said HUD\u2019s experience after Katrina led it to favor programs that guide homeowners through rebuilding rather than giving homeowners money \u201cand letting them manage the recovery process on their own.\u201d In fact, federal rules no longer allow homeowners to be compensated for losses after a disaster, and Leger said using property values to determine aid after Katrina now appears to have been a misstep. \u201cThe plan was to help the homeowner repair his home or her home and get back in the home,\u201d Leger said. The news organizations\u2019 analysis shows there were disparities, he said, and \u201cthat\u2019s something that should have been, and maybe should be, addressed.\u201d Before Katrina, the neighborhoods of Lakeview and Gentilly Woods had a lot in common. Both sat below sea level on reclaimed swampland near Lake Pontchartrain. They boasted similar post-World War II housing stock. Lakeview was almost entirely white, and Gentilly Woods was more than two-thirds Black. Lakeview residents had higher incomes, and their homes commanded higher prices. Both neighborhoods were swamped when the floodwalls along New Orleans\u2019 drainage canals buckled after Katrina. Water reached the eaves of many homes. Road Home appraised the average Lakeview home at $326,000 and the average repair cost at $286,000. With a grant based on the repair cost, the average homeowner received 83% of what was needed to rebuild, according to the news organizations\u2019 analysis. In Gentilly Woods, the average property was valued at $121,000, with $203,000 in rebuilding costs. With a grant based on the home\u2019s value, the average homeowner ended up with just 73% of what was needed to rebuild. Among those served well by Road Home was Lakeview retiree Rita Legrand, 86. She had to gut her modest ranch home. But she was determined to rebuild. With $53,000 from insurance in hand, Legrand applied for a Road Home grant in fall 2006. Road Home estimated her home\u2019s value at $320,000 and her repair costs at $188,000. Her grant, based on repair costs minus what she\u2019d already gotten from insurance, was $135,000. The grant and insurance proceeds covered her entire loss, as it was supposed to, and by April 2007 she had completely rebuilt. \u201cThe program worked great for me,\u201d she said. The experience was quite different for Cynthia and Charles Heisser of Gentilly Woods. Like Legrand, the Heissers had a small ranch house, and they had a similar repair estimate: $190,000. But their initial grant was just $32,000. Charles Heisser, a 90-year-old Korean War veteran, still has the documents explaining how Road Home arrived at that figure. Program officials estimated the pre-storm value of their home at $83,000. The state subtracted $40,000 in insurance proceeds, which their lender had made them use to pay off their mortgage, and $10,500 in FEMA aid they had received for living expenses. Charles Heisser appealed, arguing Road Home had failed to factor in tens of thousands of dollars in improvements they had made before the storm. Their home was reappraised for $135,000. That increased their grant to about $83,500. Even then, their total compensation including insurance and FEMA grants was $135,000 \u2014 just 70% of Road Home\u2019s original estimate of what it would take to make their home livable. The Heissers spent some of the Road Home grant to convert their garage into living quarters so they could move out of the FEMA trailer in their front yard. For most of the next 10 years, the house sat with a new roof and an unfinished interior where they hung laundry. Cynthia Heisser couldn\u2019t help but notice how differently things went in mostly white parts of New Orleans. \u201cIt was unjust, more unjust to the Blacks than it was to the whites,\u201d she said. People used to ask her, she recalled, \u201c\u2018Oh, you don\u2019t have your house yet?\u2019 Or \u2018You\u2019re not in your home yet?\u2019 And we\u2019d say, \u2018It isn\u2019t because we\u2019re not fighting for it. We are.\u2019\u201d A nonprofit called Rebuilding Together New Orleans eventually provided labor and materials to help finish repairs. The Heissers finally moved back into their house in 2018 \u2014 13 years after the storm. From the beginning, Road Home had a problem. On the one hand, thousands of residents desperately needed rebuilding aid. On the other, Road Home, like many disaster aid programs, had guardrails to make sure people didn\u2019t end up better off than before the storm. The idea was that \u201cit would be illegitimate for somebody whose house only had a market value of $100,000 to get $120,000, even if that was how much it would cost to repair,\u201d said Andy Horowitz, a history professor at the University of Connecticut and author of \u201cKatrina: A History, 1915-2015.\u201d When people complained that using home values to calculate grants would help some people more than others, officials argued that pre-storm value had been part of the formula from the start. Besides, Leger said at the time, it was required by the federal government, and there wasn\u2019t enough time or money to change the rules. In a June 2006 interview shortly after the program was approved, Louisiana Recovery Authority chair Norman Francis dismissed the very problem many poor homeowners would soon face \u2014 that the cost of rebuilding could far exceed the value of their homes. \u201cThat money is going to cover the difference between your damages and how much insurance you got,\u201d Francis said. \u201cNow, if you had a $50,000 home, not likely that you had $200,000 worth of damage. So the formula has to take into consideration your home value.\u201d A family member said Francis, now 91, was unavailable to comment for this story. Melanie Ehrlich, who lived in Baltimore while her Gentilly home was rebuilt, said she quickly saw the problem with the formula. She founded a grassroots organization, the Citizens\u2019 Road Home Action Team, and became a thorn in the side of Road Home officials. \u201cIt was crystal clear how very unfair the program was in its design,\u201d said Ehrlich, a Tulane University genetics professor. \u201cWhat I saw is that the victims of Hurricane Katrina were being victimized again.\u201d In October 2006, shortly after Road Home was launched, Ehrlich met with officials in charge of the recovery and argued their formula for calculating grants was unfair. She followed up with examples. Basing grants on the pre-storm value of homes, she wrote, would \u201cjustifiably anger the middle and lower economic classes, or, more specifically, everyone who does not have an expensive house or lot.\u201d As homeowners received their grant letters over the course of 2007, hundreds showed up at Finger\u2019s low-income law clinic at Loyola University. She attended dozens of public meetings in Baton Rouge, New Orleans and Washington to ask officials to fix the inequity baked into the calculations. In August 2009, Finger told a congressional committee that the formula disproportionately hurt Black residents because their homes tended to be valued for less. \u201cRoad Home\u2019s grant formula design assured that some homeowners would not receive sufficient rebuilding funds,\u201d she said. Six state officials involved with the recovery effort said they didn\u2019t ignore these complaints. But they noted that they were building a program of unprecedented scope and dealing with unforeseen problems, all while under intense pressure to get money to homeowners quickly. Leger said he took Ehrlich\u2019s complaint about pre-storm value to HUD officials and asked to use higher repair estimates instead. \u201cWe were told no,\u201d he said. Soon after the program launched, state officials said, they made changes that increased grants for all applicants: factoring land value into appraisals, using the highest of several appraisal methods and increasing rates for repair estimates. They originally envisioned an affordable loan program to fill any gaps between grants and the actual costs of rebuilding, but it never got off the ground. In 2007, they created another grant for less affluent homeowners whose initial grants didn\u2019t meet their damage estimates. That enabled the state to meet a HUD requirement to pay at least half of grant money to low- and moderate-income households. Three years later, after Black homeowners sued the head of the LRA and HUD alleging the program was discriminatory, Francis said, \u201cThat did not pass on my radar screen. If it had, I would have questioned why the program wasn\u2019t treating people equitably.\u201d Francis was a revered civil rights leader and longtime president of Xavier University, a historically Black school, and Finger said she does not believe he and the other architects of Road Home intended it to be discriminatory. Nonetheless, Finger said, \u201cIt is very difficult to look at a system that\u2019s trying to roll out that much money as quickly as possible and to not do it in a way that replicates historic, systemic inequities.\u201d The plaintiffs in the suit included Almarie Ford, who said the hurricane shutters that adorn her New Orleans East home are all she ever got from Road Home. A month after Katrina, Ford returned to find her Kingswood subdivision in ruins. The now-73-year-old social worker recalled walking into her house and gagging on the smell of black mold. She turned around, locked the front door and left, unsure what to do next. Like many homeowners, she expected significant government assistance, but it never came. Road Home officials assessed her damage at about $297,000 but based her grant on her home\u2019s value, $150,000. They gave her just $3,468 after subtracting about $146,500 in insurance payments. If the grant had been based on rebuilding costs, she would have received the maximum Road Home grant of $150,000. Instead, Ford took out a loan and exhausted her savings. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d Ford said of the size of her grant. \u201cBut what could you do? You could complain that you only got $3,500. But they said, \u2018Well, those are the rules.\u2019\u201d She wasn\u2019t willing to accept what she described as an injustice without a fight. So she went to the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center. In 2008, the housing center had joined with PolicyLink, a California nonprofit, to collect examples that showed Road Home\u2019s formula disproportionately hurt poor communities and people of color. Ironically, PolicyLink had teamed with the LRA two years earlier to present the state\u2019s initial recovery plan. In a sign of just how unexpected the inequities were, a PolicyLink representative spoke at an LRA board meeting in April 2006 and \u201capplauded the board for the design of the housing action plan,\u201d according to meeting minutes. James Perry, the head of the housing center, said his organization examined two nearly identical homes: four bedrooms, two bathrooms, brick construction. Each had flooded with 6 feet of water and had damages estimated at more than $200,000. But one house was in a white neighborhood and the other in a Black neighborhood. Each homeowner received a grant based on their home value. Perry said the white homeowner got $150,000; the Black homeowner, $90,000. Perry said his organization gave that information to Road Home and HUD, but neither took immediate action. Perry said he was shocked by what he perceived to be their lack of interest. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to remedy, but it seemed to me they would want to.\u201d In the resulting lawsuit, attorneys cited 2000 census data to prove their case: About 93% of Black-owned homes in New Orleans were valued at less than $150,000, compared to 55% of white-owned homes. The homeowners secured an important victory before a federal district judge in 2010. The next year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned that ruling and sent the case back to district court, rejecting claims the grant formula was discriminatory. The appeals court ruled that any gap in grants for Black families had been eliminated when, after the lawsuit had been filed, the state removed a $50,000 cap on the additional grant for low-income homeowners. But the news outlets\u2019 analysis shows the appeals court\u2019s assessment was wrong. The additional grants did help homeowners in lower-income, nonwhite areas in New Orleans, most of which are majority Black. Thanks in part to the program, the average grant to a Black homeowner in Louisiana was slightly larger than the average grant overall, according to state records. But in the end, the additional grants merely boosted the average share of damage covered by grants and insurance from about 51% to about 70% in those parts of New Orleans. That meant poor, nonwhite areas ultimately fared about the same as middle-income nonwhite areas, but not as well as even the poorest white ones. The analysis backs up what U.S. District Court Judge Henry Kennedy wrote in 2010 in a preliminary ruling: \u201cThe Court does not take lightly that some African American homeowners received lower awards than they would have if their homes were in predominantly white neighborhoods.\u201d Louisiana and HUD \u201coffered no legitimate reason for taking pre-storm home values into account\u201d when calculating grants, he wrote. While the appeals court accused plaintiffs of cherry-picking their data by focusing on majority-Black New Orleans, the news outlets\u2019 analysis shows the disparity between wealthy and poor neighborhoods statewide was similar to that in New Orleans. Three months after the appeals court ruling, Louisiana and HUD settled the lawsuit. The state agreed to put $62 million aside for yet another program, this one for people who made too much money to qualify for additional grants but needed more help. It was a drop in the bucket. According to a state analysis in 2010, 25,000 New Orleans homeowners received a total of $1.2 billion less from the Road Home because their grants were calculated using pre-storm value rather than the cost of damage. Despite being a plaintiff in the suit, Ford said she didn\u2019t receive anything from the settlement. Fewer than 500 people did. It took more than three years for her to complete repairs. During that time, she rented an apartment in Baton Rouge and continued to pay her mortgage, a strain that she said nearly broke her. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work for the people it was supposed to work for,\u201d Ford said of the recovery program. \u201cNone of the people that I know in New Orleans East actually got any Road Home money. A lot of people, especially people who are more elderly, they just didn\u2019t come back.\u201d One morning in September, Lynette Boutte picked up a piece of artwork in her Seventh Ward beauty salon. In the middle was a photo illustration of hundreds of Black people near the intersection of North Claiborne and Orleans avenues. It depicted Super Sunday in 2003, two years before the storm. Boutte gazed wistfully, as if she could still hear the calls of the Mardi Gras Indians that day. Since Katrina, there hasn\u2019t been such a raucous Super Sunday celebration in her neighborhood. Music was once the lifeblood of the Seventh Ward, a working-class Creole neighborhood near the French Quarter. It has produced musical greats such as Jelly Roll Morton and John Boutte, one of her nine siblings. After school, the sound of children playing trumpets would echo through the streets. In the evenings, musicians would fill her house for jam sessions. The Seventh Ward doesn\u2019t sing like it used to, she said. \u201cThere are no children in this neighborhood anymore.\u201d Boutte didn\u2019t receive a dime from Road Home to rebuild, she said, because the state lowballed her property value and repair costs. It took her nearly a decade, but she managed to rebuild with the help of relatives and church volunteers. Many weren\u2019t so lucky. Families who had lived in the neighborhood for generations were unable to return because they couldn\u2019t afford to fix their homes. In the two decades after 2000, the number of children in the Seventh Ward dropped by more than a third, according to the Data Center, a community research nonprofit. The Black population in the Seventh Ward decreased by about 19 percentage points. When asked how much responsibility the Road Home program shares for these changes, Boutte didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThey are responsible for it all,\u201d she said. William Stoudt, executive director of Rebuilding Together New Orleans, which focuses on the Seventh Ward, said over the past 15 years his staffers have witnessed many people living in \u201ccompletely substandard conditions.\u201d Road Home\u2019s grant formula is partly to blame, he said. Residents who got shortchanged had to cut corners, often hiring subpar contractors and using cheaper materials, he said. Some abandoned their properties because they couldn\u2019t afford to rebuild; others sold them to predatory developers at below-market prices. \u201cMost of the homeowners that we help work their entire lives for 11 bucks an hour at a hotel in the Quarter cleaning rooms day after day and have no savings,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never had a chance.\u201d The community is now pockmarked with empty lots and abandoned homes. Nearly 1 in 4 Seventh Ward houses were vacant in 2020, a 51% increase compared to two decades prior, according to the Data Center. In Lakeview, where Stoudt grew up, the post-Katrina recovery looks dramatically different. Stoudt remembers standing in his street three weeks after the storm amid uprooted trees and abandoned cars covered in dried mud. The waterlogged front door of his family home had swollen shut. To get inside, his parents climbed a ladder and went in through a second-story window. It was the silence, though, that haunted him. Stoudt said it seemed as if everything had died. \u201cIt was the quietest place you\u2019ve ever been in your life.\u201d That silence was soon replaced by the sound of hammers and saws. His parents\u2019 flood insurance policy covered the cost of repairs, so they didn\u2019t need a Road Home grant. Construction began almost immediately. Within a year, their home had been rebuilt. Today, he said, Lakeview is largely unrecognizable. People didn\u2019t just rebuild, they expanded \u2014 replacing their ranch houses with multistory, modern homes. \u201cNow it\u2019s McMansions, 4,000 square feet, double-lot monsters,\u201d Stoudt said. \u201cIf you were in the right neighborhood, you got what you needed to rebuild.\u201d To evaluate the impacts of the Road Home program, The Times-Picayune, ProPublica and WWL-TV obtained a novel dataset of more than 130,000 grants from the Louisiana Division of Administration. The anonymized dataset included, for each grant recipient in the state, the grant amounts, the pre-storm value of the property and any insurance and FEMA payouts. The analysis was conducted on a subset of 91,771 rebuilding grants that had valid grant and damage amounts, were not part of a lawsuit over errors in grant calculations and did not fall under a limited number of other circumstances that could yield incorrect information. Our analysis focused on 30,188 records from Orleans Parish and 5,911 from St. Bernard Parish. For our analysis of demographics and income, we used data from Summary File 3 in the 2000 U.S. Census, downloaded from IPUMS NHGIS, University of Minnesota. This dataset contains survey responses from the longform census questionnaire, which was sent to approximately one in six households, and is available on the block group level. In the city of New Orleans, additional analysis using 2000 census data was conducted using Neighborhood Statistical Areas provided by the New Orleans Data Center, a nonprofit research center that defines those boundaries. Any use of \u201cneighborhoods\u201d refers to these boundaries. The word \u201careas\u201d refers to census block groups. \n\tSophie Chou is a data reporter at ProPublica.

    "onlytext": "The complaints started as soon as Louisiana launched its massive program to help homeowners rebuild after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Community leaders said the largest rebuilding program in U.S. history would be unfair to the state\u2019s poorest residents. Activists and real estate experts spoke out at meetings of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which designed and ran the Road Home program. An attorney representing poor homeowners testified before Congress. A fair housing group sued the state and federal governments. State officials made tweaks and settled the lawsuit, but they never changed a core part of the formula that determined how much homeowners received.\n\nNow a groundbreaking analysis of nearly 92,000 rebuilding grants statewide shows critics were right all along: Road Home shortchanged people in poor neighborhoods while giving those in wealthy neighborhoods more of what they needed. People in the most impoverished areas in New Orleans \u2014 those with a median income of $15,000 or less \u2014 had to cover 30% of their rebuilding costs after Road Home grants, Federal Emergency Management Agency aid and insurance. In areas where the median income was more than $75,000, the shortfall was 20%, according to the analysis by ProPublica, The Times-Picayune | The Advocate and WWL-TV.\n\nPoverty tracks closely with race in New Orleans, so the shortfalls in the city disproportionately hurt Black people. Road Home also underpaid residents of St. Bernard Parish, a mostly white, working-class community devastated by the hurricane. Had properties in the lowest-income parts of New Orleans been covered at the same rate as the wealthiest, each of those households would have received about $18,000 more on average. Across the city, covering all homeowners\u2019 repair costs at the rate of the highest earners would have resulted in another $349 million for rebuilding.\n\nThe Road Home program was hugely consequential for Louisiana, and much more so for its largest city, most of which flooded after Katrina\u2019s storm surge overwhelmed its levees. Most homeowners didn\u2019t have adequate insurance. Facing the possibility of a mass exodus, state leaders devised Road Home to cover the gap and encourage people to rebuild. Road Home also allowed homeowners to sell their property to the state and move elsewhere, though housing was scarce in the region. If homeowners didn\u2019t stay in Louisiana, they forfeited 40% of their home\u2019s value.\n\nNew Orleans was the biggest beneficiary of rebuilding grants, and half of all owner-occupied homes in New Orleans received rebuilding grants, with $3.3 billion awarded citywide. Some neighborhoods rebounded quickly. Others languished. Housing advocates say that\u2019s due to the original sin of the Road Home program: It calculated each grant based on a home\u2019s value before the hurricane or on the cost of repairs \u2014 whichever was less.\n\nThe value of most homes in poor areas was lower than the cost of rebuilding them, so the resulting grants didn\u2019t cover all repairs. But for most people in affluent areas, the rebuilding cost was lower than the value of their homes. They got grants that came closer to covering their needs.\n\n\u201cThe practical effects of how this program shaped the city can still be seen today,\u201d said Davida Finger, an attorney who testified to Congress in 2009 about unfairness in the Road Home program. Poor New Orleanians had a much harder time covering the costs. For a homeowner in the lowest-income areas, it would have taken more than 43 months at the average annual salary to pay the cost of repairs not covered by Road Home, FEMA and insurance, the news outlets found. In the highest-income areas, it would have taken less than eight months.\n\nThe shortcomings in the Road Home program are part of a broader tapestry of failures in the ways America helps people affected by catastrophes. A yearlong investigation by ProPublica, The Times-Picayune | The Advocate and WWL-TV has found that disaster programs often shortchange the people who need it most, worsening inequities in the wake of disaster.\n\nFinger said the news organizations\u2019 findings were \u201cshocking but not surprising.\u201d \u201cWhat Black homeowners, what lawyers, what advocates, what community organizers, what reporters were telling the program designers all along was completely accurate,\u201d Finger said. \u201cThey simply didn\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d\n\nThe state Office of Community Development took issue with the analysis, but none of the points it raised affected the news organizations\u2019 findings. Two officials who were in charge of the recovery told the news outlets that the findings were troubling.\n\nAndy Kopplin, the first executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, stressed that state officials took pains to steer more money to poorer homeowners through a second grant program. But Kopplin acknowledged in a written statement that the findings show that low- and middle-income households should\u2019ve received more. That\u2019s \u201cupsetting to those of us who were working to create more equitable outcomes and especially to those families who needed and deserved more resources for their recovery,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWalter Leger, who was a key board member of the LRA, said the findings should spur the state to seek more federal aid from Congress to fill the gaps. De\u2019Marcus Finnell, deputy press secretary for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, declined to address the findings directly. But in a statement he said HUD\u2019s experience after Katrina led it to favor programs that guide homeowners through rebuilding rather than giving homeowners money \u201cand letting them manage the recovery process on their own.\u201d\n\nIn fact, federal rules no longer allow homeowners to be compensated for losses after a disaster, and Leger said using property values to determine aid after Katrina now appears to have been a misstep. \u201cThe plan was to help the homeowner repair his home or her home and get back in the home,\u201d Leger said. The news organizations\u2019 analysis shows there were disparities, he said, and \u201cthat\u2019s something that should have been, and maybe should be, addressed.\u201d\n\nBefore Katrina, the neighborhoods of Lakeview and Gentilly Woods had a lot in common. Both sat below sea level on reclaimed swampland near Lake Pontchartrain. They boasted similar post-World War II housing stock. Lakeview was almost entirely white, and Gentilly Woods was more than two-thirds Black. Lakeview residents had higher incomes, and their homes commanded higher prices. Both neighborhoods were swamped when the floodwalls along New Orleans\u2019 drainage canals buckled after Katrina. Water reached the eaves of many homes.\n\nRoad Home appraised the average Lakeview home at $326,000 and the average repair cost at $286,000. With a grant based on the repair cost, the average homeowner received 83% of what was needed to rebuild, according to the news organizations\u2019 analysis. In Gentilly Woods, the average property was valued at $121,000, with $203,000 in rebuilding costs. With a grant based on the home\u2019s value, the average homeowner ended up with just 73% of what was needed to rebuild.\n\nAmong those served well by Road Home was Lakeview retiree Rita Legrand, 86. She had to gut her modest ranch home. But she was determined to rebuild. With $53,000 from insurance in hand, Legrand applied for a Road Home grant in fall 2006. Road Home estimated her home\u2019s value at $320,000 and her repair costs at $188,000. Her grant, based on repair costs minus what she\u2019d already gotten from insurance, was $135,000. The grant and insurance proceeds covered her entire loss, as it was supposed to, and by April 2007 she had completely rebuilt.\n\n\u201cThe program worked great for me,\u201d she said.\n\nThe experience was quite different for Cynthia and Charles Heisser of Gentilly Woods. Like Legrand, the Heissers had a small ranch house, and they had a similar repair estimate: $190,000. But their initial grant was just $32,000. Charles Heisser, a 90-year-old Korean War veteran, still has the documents explaining how Road Home arrived at that figure. Program officials estimated the pre-storm value of their home at $83,000. The state subtracted $40,000 in insurance proceeds, which their lender had made them use to pay off their mortgage, and $10,500 in FEMA aid they had received for living expenses.\n\nCharles Heisser appealed, arguing Road Home had failed to factor in tens of thousands of dollars in improvements they had made before the storm. Their home was reappraised for $135,000. That increased their grant to about $83,500. Even then, their total compensation including insurance and FEMA grants was $135,000 \u2014 just 70% of Road Home\u2019s original estimate of what it would take to make their home livable.\n\nThe Heissers spent some of the Road Home grant to convert their garage into living quarters so they could move out of the FEMA trailer in their front yard. For most of the next 10 years, the house sat with a new roof and an unfinished interior where they hung laundry. Cynthia Heisser couldn\u2019t help but notice how differently things went in mostly white parts of New Orleans.\n\n\u201cIt was unjust, more unjust to the Blacks than it was to the whites,\u201d she said. People used to ask her, she recalled, \u201c\u2018Oh, you don\u2019t have your house yet?\u2019 Or \u2018You\u2019re not in your home yet?\u2019 And we\u2019d say, \u2018It isn\u2019t because we\u2019re not fighting for it. We are.\u2019\u201d\n\nA nonprofit called Rebuilding Together New Orleans eventually provided labor and materials to help finish repairs. The Heissers finally moved back into their house in 2018 \u2014 13 years after the storm.\n\nFrom the beginning, Road Home had a problem. On the one hand, thousands of residents desperately needed rebuilding aid. On the other, Road Home, like many disaster aid programs, had guardrails to make sure people didn\u2019t end up better off than before the storm.\n\nThe idea was that \u201cit would be illegitimate for somebody whose house only had a market value of $100,000 to get $120,000, even if that was how much it would cost to repair,\u201d said Andy Horowitz, a history professor at the University of Connecticut and author of \u201cKatrina: A History, 1915-2015.\u201d\n\nWhen people complained that using home values to calculate grants would help some people more than others, officials argued that pre-storm value had been part of the formula from the start. Besides, Leger said at the time, it was required by the federal government, and there wasn\u2019t enough time or money to change the rules.\n\nIn a June 2006 interview shortly after the program was approved, Louisiana Recovery Authority chair Norman Francis dismissed the very problem many poor homeowners would soon face \u2014 that the cost of rebuilding could far exceed the value of their homes.\n\n\u201cThat money is going to cover the difference between your damages and how much insurance you got,\u201d Francis said. \u201cNow, if you had a $50,000 home, not likely that you had $200,000 worth of damage. So the formula has to take into consideration your home value.\u201d\n\nA family member said Francis, now 91, was unavailable to comment for this story.\n\nMelanie Ehrlich, who lived in Baltimore while her Gentilly home was rebuilt, said she quickly saw the problem with the formula. She founded a grassroots organization, the Citizens\u2019 Road Home Action Team, and became a thorn in the side of Road Home officials.\n\n\u201cIt was crystal clear how very unfair the program was in its design,\u201d said Ehrlich, a Tulane University genetics professor. \u201cWhat I saw is that the victims of Hurricane Katrina were being victimized again.\u201d\n\nIn October 2006, shortly after Road Home was launched, Ehrlich met with officials in charge of the recovery and argued their formula for calculating grants was unfair. She followed up with examples. Basing grants on the pre-storm value of homes, she wrote, would \u201cjustifiably anger the middle and lower economic classes, or, more specifically, everyone who does not have an expensive house or lot.\u201d\n\nAs homeowners received their grant letters over the course of 2007, hundreds showed up at Finger\u2019s low-income law clinic at Loyola University. She attended dozens of public meetings in Baton Rouge, New Orleans and Washington to ask officials to fix the inequity baked into the calculations.\n\nIn August 2009, Finger told a congressional committee that the formula disproportionately hurt Black residents because their homes tended to be valued for less.\n\n\u201cRoad Home\u2019s grant formula design assured that some homeowners would not receive sufficient rebuilding funds,\u201d she said.\n\nSix state officials involved with the recovery effort said they didn\u2019t ignore these complaints. But they noted that they were building a program of unprecedented scope and dealing with unforeseen problems, all while under intense pressure to get money to homeowners quickly.\n\nLeger said he took Ehrlich\u2019s complaint about pre-storm value to HUD officials and asked to use higher repair estimates instead.\n\n\u201cWe were told no,\u201d he said.\n\nSoon after the program launched, state officials said, they made changes that increased grants for all applicants: factoring land value into appraisals, using the highest of several appraisal methods and increasing rates for repair estimates.\n\nThey originally envisioned an affordable loan program to fill any gaps between grants and the actual costs of rebuilding, but it never got off the ground. In 2007, they created another grant for less affluent homeowners whose initial grants didn\u2019t meet their damage estimates.\n\nThat enabled the state to meet a HUD requirement to pay at least half of grant money to low- and moderate-income households.\n\nThree years later, after Black homeowners sued the head of the LRA and HUD alleging the program was discriminatory, Francis said, \u201cThat did not pass on my radar screen. If it had, I would have questioned why the program wasn\u2019t treating people equitably.\u201d\n\nFrancis was a revered civil rights leader and longtime president of Xavier University, a historically Black school, and Finger said she does not believe he and the other architects of Road Home intended it to be discriminatory.\n\nNonetheless, Finger said, \u201cIt is very difficult to look at a system that\u2019s trying to roll out that much money as quickly as possible and to not do it in a way that replicates historic, systemic inequities.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs in the suit included Almarie Ford, who said the hurricane shutters that adorn her New Orleans East home are all she ever got from Road Home.\n\nA month after Katrina, Ford returned to find her Kingswood subdivision in ruins. The now-73-year-old social worker recalled walking into her house and gagging on the smell of black mold. She turned around, locked the front door and left, unsure what to do next.\n\nLike many homeowners, she expected significant government assistance, but it never came.\n\nRoad Home officials assessed her damage at about $297,000 but based her grant on her home\u2019s value, $150,000. They gave her just $3,468 after subtracting about $146,500 in insurance payments.\n\nIf the grant had been based on rebuilding costs, she would have received the maximum Road Home grant of $150,000. Instead, Ford took out a loan and exhausted her savings.\n\n\u201cI was shocked,\u201d Ford said of the size of her grant. \u201cBut what could you do? You could complain that you only got $3,500. But they said, \u2018Well, those are the rules.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t willing to accept what she described as an injustice without a fight. So she went to the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center.\n\nIn 2008, the housing center had joined with PolicyLink, a California nonprofit, to collect examples that showed Road Home\u2019s formula disproportionately hurt poor communities and people of color.\n\nIronically, PolicyLink had teamed with the LRA two years earlier to present the state\u2019s initial recovery plan.\n\nIn a sign of just how unexpected the inequities were, a PolicyLink representative spoke at an LRA board meeting in April 2006 and \u201capplauded the board for the design of the housing action plan,\u201d according to meeting minutes.\n\nJames Perry, the head of the housing center, said his organization examined two nearly identical homes: four bedrooms, two bathrooms, brick construction. Each had flooded with 6 feet of water and had damages estimated at more than $200,000.\n\nBut one house was in a white neighborhood and the other in a Black neighborhood. Perry said the white homeowner got $150,000; the Black homeowner, $90,000.\n\nPerry said his organization gave that information to Road Home and HUD, but neither took immediate action.\n\nPerry said he was shocked by what he perceived to be their lack of interest.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to remedy, but it seemed to me they would want to.\u201d\n\nIn the resulting lawsuit, attorneys cited 2000 census data to prove their case: About 93% of Black-owned homes in New Orleans were valued at less than $150,000, compared to 55% of white-owned homes.\n\nThe homeowners secured an important victory before a federal district judge in 2010.\n\nThe next year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned that ruling and sent the case back to district court, rejecting claims the grant formula was discriminatory.\n\nThe appeals court ruled that any gap in grants for Black families had been eliminated when, after the lawsuit had been filed, the state removed a $50,000 cap on the additional grant for low-income homeowners.\n\nBut the news outlets\u2019 analysis shows the appeals court\u2019s assessment was wrong.\n\nThe additional grants did help homeowners in lower-income, nonwhite areas in New Orleans, most of which are majority Black.\n\nThanks in part to the program, the average grant to a Black homeowner in Louisiana was slightly larger than the average grant overall, according to state records.\n\nBut in the end, the additional grants merely boosted the average share of damage covered by grants and insurance from about 51% to about 70% in those parts of New Orleans.\n\nThat meant poor, nonwhite areas ultimately fared about the same as middle-income nonwhite areas, but not as well as even the poorest white ones.\n\nThe analysis backs up what U.S. District Court Judge Henry Kennedy wrote in 2010 in a preliminary ruling: \u201cThe Court does not take lightly that some African American homeowners received lower awards than they would have if their homes were in predominantly white neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nLouisiana and HUD \u201coffered no legitimate reason for taking pre-storm home values into account\u201d when calculating grants, he wrote.\n\nWhile the appeals court accused plaintiffs of cherry-picking their data by focusing on majority-Black New Orleans, the news outlets\u2019 analysis shows the disparity between wealthy and poor neighborhoods statewide was similar to that in New Orleans.\n\nThree months after the appeals court ruling, Louisiana and HUD settled the lawsuit.\n\nThe state agreed to put $62 million aside for yet another program, this one for people who made too much money to qualify for additional grants but needed more help.\n\nIt was a drop in the bucket.\n\nAccording to a state analysis in 2010, 25,000 New Orleans homeowners received a total of $1.2 billion less from the Road Home because their grants were calculated using pre-storm value rather than the cost of damage.\n\nDespite being a plaintiff in the suit, Ford said she didn\u2019t receive anything from the settlement.\n\nFewer than 500 people did.\n\nIt took more than three years for her to complete repairs.\n\nDuring that time, she rented an apartment in Baton Rouge and continued to pay her mortgage, a strain that she said nearly broke her.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t work for the people it was supposed to work for,\u201d Ford said of the recovery program.\n\n\u201cNone of the people that I know in New Orleans East actually got any Road Home money. A lot of people, especially people who are more elderly, they just didn\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\nOne morning in September, Lynette Boutte picked up a piece of artwork in her Seventh Ward beauty salon.\n\nIn the middle was a photo illustration of hundreds of Black people near the intersection of North Claiborne and Orleans avenues.\n\nIt depicted Super Sunday in 2003, two years before the storm.\n\nBoutte gazed wistfully, as if she could still hear the calls of the Mardi Gras Indians that day.\n\nSince Katrina, there hasn\u2019t been such a raucous Super Sunday celebration in her neighborhood.\n\nMusic was once the lifeblood of the Seventh Ward, a working-class Creole neighborhood near the French Quarter.\n\nIt has produced musical greats such as Jelly Roll Morton and John Boutte, one of her nine siblings.\n\nAfter school, the sound of children playing trumpets would echo through the streets.\n\nIn the evenings, musicians would fill her house for jam sessions.\n\nThe Seventh Ward doesn\u2019t sing like it used to, she said.\n\n\u201cThere are no children in this neighborhood anymore.\u201d\n\nBoutte didn\u2019t receive a dime from Road Home to rebuild, she said, because the state lowballed her property value and repair costs.\n\nIt took her nearly a decade, but she managed to rebuild with the help of relatives and church volunteers.\n\nMany weren\u2019t so lucky.\n\nFamilies who had lived in the neighborhood for generations were unable to return because they couldn\u2019t afford to fix their homes.\n\nIn the two decades after 2000, the number of children in the Seventh Ward dropped by more than a third, according to the Data Center, a community research nonprofit.\n\nThe Black population in the Seventh Ward decreased by about 19 percentage points.\n\nWhen asked how much responsibility the Road Home program shares for these changes, Boutte didn\u2019t hesitate.\n\n\u201cThey are responsible for it all,\u201d she said.\n\nWilliam Stoudt, executive director of Rebuilding Together New Orleans, which focuses on the Seventh Ward, said over the past 15 years his staffers have witnessed many people living in \u201ccompletely substandard conditions.\u201d\n\nRoad Home\u2019s grant formula is partly to blame, he said.\n\nResidents who got shortchanged had to cut corners, often hiring subpar contractors and using cheaper materials, he said.\n\nSome abandoned their properties because they couldn\u2019t afford to rebuild; others sold them to predatory developers at below-market prices.\n\n\u201cMost of the homeowners that we help work their entire lives for 11 bucks an hour at a hotel in the Quarter cleaning rooms day after day and have no savings,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey never had a chance.\u201d\n\nThe community is now pockmarked with empty lots and abandoned homes.\n\nNearly 1 in 4 Seventh Ward houses were vacant in 2020, a 51% increase compared to two decades prior.\n\nIn Lakeview, where Stoudt grew up, the post-Katrina recovery looks dramatically different.\n\nStoudt remembers standing in his street three weeks after the storm amid uprooted trees and abandoned cars covered in dried mud.\n\nThe waterlogged front door of his family home had swollen shut.\n\nTo get inside, his parents climbed a ladder and went in through a second-story window.\n\nIt was the silence, though, that haunted him.\n\nStoudt said it seemed as if everything had died.\n\n\u201cIt was the quietest place you\u2019ve ever been in your life.\u201d\n\nThat silence was soon replaced by the sound of hammers and saws.\n\nHis parents\u2019 flood insurance policy covered the cost of repairs, so they didn\u2019t need a Road Home grant.\n\nConstruction began almost immediately.\n\nWithin a year, their home had been rebuilt.\n\nToday, he said, Lakeview is largely unrecognizable.\n\nPeople didn\u2019t just rebuild, they expanded \u2014 replacing their ranch houses with multistory, modern homes.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s McMansions, 4,000 square feet, double-lot monsters,\u201d Stoudt said.\n\n\u201cIf you were in the right neighborhood, you got what you needed to rebuild.\u201d",

You are free to republish it so long as you do the following:\t This article was produced in partnership with The Southern Illinoisan, which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network. When I pulled my Jeep into the Clay Arsenal neighborhood in Hartford, Connecticut, in July, I knew intuitively that I had arrived by the sights of neglect: Beautifully crafted brick homes in varying stages of decay. Boarded up buildings. A feeling of isolation in an otherwise bustling city. I had driven 1,100 miles from southern Illinois for an appointment with Josh Serrano. He was among a handful of tenants who had led a monthslong campaign to implore the city and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to take action against an absentee landlord over poor conditions. I wanted to meet Serrano because I had covered poor living conditions and seeming federal indifference in places like the Illinois cities of Cairo and East St. Louis, in my region, and he was optimistic that by speaking with one voice, a community could achieve change. I recognized Serrano\u2019s neighborhood from online photographs. It\u2019s what journalists would call \u201cdistressed,\u201d a catchall word that quickly and diplomatically describes many of the places I visited this year while reporting on the affordable housing challenges facing economically struggling rural towns and midsize cities for The Southern Illinoisan, and supported by ProPublica\u2019s Local Reporting Network. But the word distressed, as one might also describe a favorite leather jacket or piece of reclaimed furniture, has never felt like a strong enough descriptor for the virus of political indifference that plagues these places and the people who call them home. Forget the rural-urban divide. Places like Serrano\u2019s neighborhood in Hartford and the southern Illinois region I call home are connected by a resource gap as much as or more than we are divided by geographic boundaries. Few issues make that more apparent than the nation\u2019s affordable housing crisis. I knocked on Serrano\u2019s door and he led a photographer and me upstairs. Serrano is 26 years old. He\u2019s lived in this neighborhood his entire life. Before he was born, his mother moved to Hartford from Puerto Rico with his two older brothers, searching for opportunity. About 13 years ago, Serrano said his mom moved the family into a federally subsidized property, where she raised him, his brothers and four foster siblings who are cousins. It was fine at first, he said, but complaints about safety concerns went unaddressed in more recent years. A number of tenants, including his mom, were afraid to speak out because they feared losing their homes and ending up in a worse predicament, he said. Finally, Serrano said he\u2019d had enough. Around his kitchen table, Serrano told me how he and a half-dozen of his neighbors met for hours each week over the course of months studying HUD policies, canvassing their neighborhood to gather feedback from other renters and pushing for accountability as the rats multiplied and the mold grew inside their homes. Eventually, the tenants won action from HUD. In May, the agency announced that it was ending its contract with Serrano\u2019s landlord, and that he and the 150 families living in his building and others would receive vouchers to subsidize their rent in the private market. But it\u2019s hard to celebrate the dismantling of a neighborhood and the loss of affordable housing, even if that\u2019s the best of bad options. There is a shortage of subsidized four- and five- bedroom units in Hartford, the state capital, making it challenging for some larger families to find alternative rentals that will accept their vouchers, commonly known as Section 8, in the neighborhoods where they want to live. At the start of the year, my goal was to explore HUD\u2019s failure to enforce legal standards for decent, safe, sanitary housing in apartments subsidized by federal tax dollars, particularly in regions like mine that modern-day HUD policy seems to have left behind. I visited Evansville, Indiana; Wellston, Missouri; Steubenville, Ohio; Peoria, Illinois; and Hudson, New York, and found that they are all dealing with similar challenges. What started as a simple premise brought to light much greater challenges. HUD\u2019s oversight failures are profound, and they have left thousands of children and their families, seniors and people with disabilities living in unsafe housing for years. As landlords have slapped paint over mold, cardboard over holes, and hid problems behind walls and \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d signs, the agency has often looked the other way. But these failures are symptomatic of much broader problems. To some extent, HUD has been put in an impossible position, starved for years by congressional budget cuts and lacking adequate staffing levels to monitor public and private landlords. Republicans have spent years eviscerating HUD, beginning with the Reagan administration and accelerating after the GOP won control of Congress in 1994, promising to rein in spending on social welfare programs. Chronic underfunding has persisted since then, especially for programs that fund public housing authorities. More recently, some have blamed HUD Secretary Ben Carson, trained as a neurosurgeon, as problems deepened, and his administration has done little to dislodge the inertia. But few Democratic politicians have publicly championed public housing or prioritized HUD either. As buildings age, HUD is increasingly looking to the private sector to fund a backlog of repairs and to provide new affordable units, and the agency has offered few solutions to those places that cannot attract private landlords to replace what\u2019s being lost to neglect. These policies are based on the belief that housing should follow the economy, thereby encouraging low-income families to move into areas with more opportunities for jobs and education. While that makes for a great political pitch, it infrequently plays out that way in reality. The shortcomings of this push toward privatization are felt most in struggling rural towns and midsize cities \u2014 the places that rely the most heavily on HUD. This allows old, unsafe housing to deteriorate beyond the point of repair. In the midst of a nationwide affordable housing crisis, the agency is sometimes forced to choose between looking the other way despite knowledge of unsafe conditions or forcing tenants to leave and find their way in a tight housing market with few better alternatives. This has paralyzed HUD, forcing agency officials to run from one embarrassing oversight failure to the next instead of creating systems and policies that proactively improve access to affordable housing. Just last month, HUD told city officials in Wellston that it planned to dissolve the housing authority on Jan. 1, and then demolish or sell all of its public housing units. Nearly a fifth of Wellston\u2019s 2,300 citizens live in public housing. Behind closed doors, a senior HUD official told Wellston\u2019s council members that it was a tough decision to make, but that the federal government isn\u2019t investing in public housing like it once did. When Carson visited Cairo in August 2017, four months after agency officials told families their 1940s-era apartments would be torn down and not replaced, he told tenants that it \u201cseems unfair\u201d that people have to suffer the consequences of past failures, \u201cbut that\u2019s the world we live in. There\u2019s a lot of unfairness in the world.\u201d But unfairness implies some sort of bad luck beyond one\u2019s circumstances, like a person who has never smoked but is diagnosed with lung cancer. The housing challenges in evidence today are solvable, advocates say, and ignoring them amounts to injustice. As my year working with ProPublica draws to a close, I\u2019m left with more questions than answers. Among them: Why will HUD officials only acknowledge what\u2019s happening to their agency and the people they serve behind closed doors? Why are so few people aware that the dismantling of HUD over many years is having a devastating effect on communities? When will politicians stop pretending they are surprised and outraged by massive housing failures from Cairo to New York after decades of funding and staff cuts and indifference? As I left Hartford, I wondered what would become of Serrano and his neighborhood. Several months later, Serrano told me by phone that he\u2019d found another place nearby. He started working part time for the neighborhood advocacy organization that helped him and the other tenants organize, and he hopes to be able to pass on what he learned to others in similar situations. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to sugarcoat it,\u201d he said of the neighborhood\u2019s challenges, including crime. \u201cBut what people don\u2019t see is the other side of it: the love out here, the care we take of each other.\u201d Molly Parker is an investigative reporter, focusing on public housing, for The Southern Illinoisan.

In May, the agency announced that it was ending its contract with Serrano\u2019s landlord, and that he and the 150 families living in his building and others would receive vouchers to subsidize their rent in the private market.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to celebrate the dismantling of a neighborhood and the loss of affordable housing, even if that\u2019s the best of bad options. There is a shortage of subsidized four- and five- bedroom units in Hartford, the state capital, making it challenging for some larger families to find alternative rentals that will accept their vouchers, commonly known as Section 8, in the neighborhoods where they want to live.\n\nAt the start of the year, my goal was to explore HUD\u2019s failure to enforce legal standards for decent, safe, sanitary housing in apartments subsidized by federal tax dollars, particularly in regions like mine that modern-day HUD policy seems to have left behind. I visited Evansville, Indiana; Wellston, Missouri; Steubenville, Ohio; Peoria, Illinois; and Hudson, New York, and found that they are all dealing with similar challenges.\n\nWhat started as a simple premise brought to light much greater challenges. HUD\u2019s oversight failures are profound, and they have left thousands of children and their families, seniors and people with disabilities living in unsafe housing for years. As landlords have slapped paint over mold, cardboard over holes, and hid problems behind walls and \u201cDo Not Enter\u201d signs, the agency has often looked the other way.\n\nBut these failures are symptomatic of much broader problems. To some extent, HUD has been put in an impossible position, starved for years by congressional budget cuts and lacking adequate staffing levels to monitor public and private landlords. Republicans have spent years eviscerating HUD, beginning with the Reagan administration and accelerating after the GOP won control of Congress in 1994, promising to rein in spending on social welfare programs. Chronic underfunding has persisted since then, especially for programs that fund public housing authorities.\n\nMore recently, some have blamed HUD Secretary Ben Carson, trained as a neurosurgeon, as problems deepened, and his administration has done little to dislodge the inertia. But few Democratic politicians have publicly championed public housing or prioritized HUD either.\n\nAs buildings age, HUD is increasingly looking to the private sector to fund a backlog of repairs and to provide new affordable units, and the agency has offered few solutions to those places that cannot attract private landlords to replace what\u2019s being lost to neglect. These policies are based on the belief that housing should follow the economy, thereby encouraging low-income families to move into areas with more opportunities for jobs and education. While that makes for a great political pitch, it infrequently plays out that way in reality.\n\nThe shortcomings of this push toward privatization are felt most in struggling rural towns and midsize cities \u2014 the places that rely the most heavily on HUD. This allows old, unsafe housing to deteriorate beyond the point of repair. In the midst of a nationwide affordable housing crisis, the agency is sometimes forced to choose between looking the other way despite knowledge of unsafe conditions or forcing tenants to leave and find their way in a tight housing market with few better alternatives.\n\nThis has paralyzed HUD, forcing agency officials to run from one embarrassing oversight failure to the next instead of creating systems and policies that proactively improve access to affordable housing. Just last month, HUD told city officials in Wellston that it planned to dissolve the housing authority on Jan. 1, and then demolish or sell all of its public housing units. Nearly a fifth of Wellston\u2019s 2,300 citizens live in public housing.\n\nBehind closed doors, a senior HUD official told Wellston\u2019s council members that it was a tough decision to make, but that the federal government isn\u2019t investing in public housing like it once did. When Carson visited Cairo in August 2017, four months after agency officials told families their 1940s-era apartments would be torn down and not replaced, he told tenants that it \u201cseems unfair\u201d that people have to suffer the consequences of past failures, \u201cbut that\u2019s the world we live in. There\u2019s a lot of unfairness in the world.\u201d\n\nBut unfairness implies some sort of bad luck beyond one\u2019s circumstances, like a person who has never smoked but is diagnosed with lung cancer. The housing challenges in evidence today are solvable, advocates say, and ignoring them amounts to injustice.\n\nAs my year working with ProPublica draws to a close, I\u2019m left with more questions than answers. Among them: Why will HUD officials only acknowledge what\u2019s happening to their agency and the people they serve behind closed doors? Why are so few people aware that the dismantling of HUD over many years is having a devastating effect on communities? When will politicians stop pretending they are surprised and outraged by massive housing failures from Cairo to New York after decades of funding and staff cuts and indifference?\n\nAs I left Hartford, I wondered what would become of Serrano and his neighborhood. Several months later, Serrano told me by phone that he\u2019d found another place nearby. He started working part time for the neighborhood advocacy organization that helped him and the other tenants organize, and he hopes to be able to pass on what he learned to others in similar situations. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to sugarcoat it,\u201d he said of the neighborhood\u2019s challenges, including crime. \u201cBut what people don\u2019t see is the other side of it: the love out here, the care we take of each other.\u201d",

But economists say there's a balance. Income inequality is a big problem, many economists agree. But they also say some level of inequality is necessary for capitalism to work. Inequality in the U.S. has risen to levels not seen since the 1920s. The top 1 percent pocket more than 20 percent of the nation's income, and the 400 richest people in the country own more wealth than everyone in the bottom 50 percent. That's not healthy for the society or the economy, says Branko Milanovic, an economist at the City University of New York Graduate Center. For one thing, he says, it undermines the idea of equal opportunity. \"It makes some people excluded or poor and unable to actually, for example, go to school, complete studies and contribute to society,\" he says. That hurts individuals and, Milanovic says, it hurts the broader economy by not allowing a whole segment of society to be as productive as it could be. French economist Thomas Piketty has warned in his best-seller Capital in the Twenty-First Century that inequality is likely to grow. That's because capitalism tends to reward the owners of capital with a greater and greater share of the economy's output, he says. Meanwhile, wage-earners get a smaller and smaller share. Milanovic says that concentration of wealth is a threat to democracy. \"The elites start dominating the political discourse and even political decision-making, and then they reinforce their own privilege,\" he says. Still, Milanovic says some level of inequality is needed to make capitalism work. \"It provides incentives for harder work, study, investment and ... general desire to better one's condition and the condition of one's kids,\" he says. But what's the right level of inequality? Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, says whether a certain level of inequality is good or bad depends on how it came be. \"If your society has a lot of inequality because a lot of your producers have done very well selling their products on global markets, that kind of inequality is not harmful in general,\" he says. \"But if you have inequality because your poorer people don't have enough economic opportunity, I would say that is a big problem.\" Cowen thinks the big rise in incomes at the top in the U.S. is coming mostly for the right reasons. But he is concerned that incomes are stagnating for Americans in the middle and at the bottom. He believes that's partly the result of inadequate education and the high cost of health care and housing. There was a period of declining inequality in the U.S.: in the three decades after World War II. But, as Cowen points out, that happened because so much wealth and capital, like factories, were destroyed in the previous three decades by two world wars and the Great Depression. \"The relative equality following World War II was because we had destroyed so many things in the world and we needed to rebuild them, and that created a lot of middle-class jobs for people,\" he says. \"But short of having another world war, we cannot re-create those circumstances, and of course we shouldn't try to.\" But there were other reasons for a more equal distribution of income and wealth back then: higher taxes on the wealthy, for one. And, Harvard labor economist Richard Freeman says, there was another difference between then and now. \"One of the key factors in that period of time was very strong unions,\" he says. Those unions bargained with the owners of capital to give workers a larger share of the economy's output. But Freeman says we shouldn't look to unions, which are much weaker now, to have a big impact. In fact, he takes a very different tack. \"The capitalists are making money; everybody's got to be a bit of a capitalist,\" he says. That's an idea as old as America's beginnings, says Freeman. The founders, he says, thought broad ownership of land, a capital asset, was very important. \"That was being driven by the notion that if we don't make sure that everybody has an ownership stake in what was the capital of that time, we were going to end up with a class of rich people separate from the middle class, and that was not healthy for democracy,\" Freeman says. He advocates employee stock ownership and profit-sharing as tactics for closing America's inequality gap. Milanovic suggests substantial estate taxes and more equal taxation of labor and capital \u2014 currently income from labor is taxed at significantly higher levels. Cowen would focus on improving education and on making health care and housing more affordable to help people at the bottom do better. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "text": "ByTommy Beer, Former Staff. New data available from the U.S. Federal Reserve shows that the wealth gap in America has widened and economic inequality increased in 2020 amidst a coronavirus pandemic that has disproportionately impacted low-wage service workers and people of color, which coincides with a report published earlier this week showing that global billionaire wealth has concurrently skyrocketed at an unprecedented rate. According to the latest Fed data, the top 1% of Americans have a combined net worth of $34.2 trillion (or 30.4% of all household wealth in the U.S.), while the bottom 50% of the population holds just $2.1 trillion combined (or 1.9% of all wealth). A study published earlier this week by Swiss bank UBS and accounting firm PwC found that the total wealth of the world\u2019s 2,189 billionaires soared to a record-setting high of $10.2 trillion in late July, obliterating the previous record of $8.9 trillion recorded at the end of 2017. American billionaires have grown significantly richer during the pandemic, led by Elon Musk, who crossed the $100 billion benchmark in August to become the world\u2019s fifth centibillionaire, and saw his wealth increase by 242% over the first eight months of 2020 (Jeff Bezos has added $65 billion to his net worth this year). A critical factor in the explosion of wealth among a particular segment of the U.S. population has been access and exposure to the stock market.\u00a0 The Fed estimates that the wealthiest 10% of Americans hold more than 88% of all available equity in corporations and mutual fund shares (with just the top 1% controlling more than twice as much equity as the bottom 50% of all Americans combined).  The numbers have been trending in this direction for a long time. The data provided by the Federal Reserve tracks back to 1989, and it shows that over the past three decades, the top 10% of U.S. households have seen their wealth rise by almost ten percentage points (from less than 61% of all wealth to 69%), while the total wealth controlled by the bottom 50% has been cut nearly in half (from 3.6% to 1.9%). While many middle- and upper-middle-class Americans have been able to work from home and reap the rewards of a robust stock market via their retirement accounts, those near the bottom of the economic ladder have been battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed the lives of more than 210,000 Americans and served to exacerbate financial inequalities. Last week, 840,000 people filed new unemployment claims. It\u2019s the sixth consecutive week that new claims have exceeded 800,000. A total of 25.5 million are currently receiving some form of government unemployment benefit.",

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  What brought about another decade of growing income inequality in the United States? The 2010s began and ended with pushes against inequality. The Occupy Wall Street movement made headlines back in 2011. And right now, Democratic presidential candidates are pushing ideas like a wealth tax. Even President Trump has made references to some of his supporters as forgotten Americans.The longest economic expansion in U.S. history, which began in 2009, has finally brought up wages. Yet none of this changes the numbers noticed by David Wessel, director of The Hutchins Center at The Brookings Institution. David, welcome back.DAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Good morning.INSKEEP: And happy New Year. What are you seeing in the numbers?WESSEL: Well, most people's economic fortunes did improve during the 2010s as the economy slowly climbed out of this terrible Great Recession. But by almost any measure, the gap between the people at the very top and the rest of us continued to widen. There are a couple of economists at Berkeley - Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman - who've done a lot of work on this, and they say that the income before taxes of the top 1% is now a bigger share of the pie than at any time since the 1920s.And even after you take account of federal taxes and means-tested government programs like Medicare, which take money from the top and give it to people at the bottom, the Congressional Budget Office says that the overall incomes of the bottom fifth of the population rose by 34% after adjusting for inflation during the decade. But the incomes of the top fifth rose by 58%, a lot more.INSKEEP: Now, I'm thinking of that truism about a rising tide lifting all boats. The economy seems to be lifting all boats, but some people are way above the ocean in a private jet.WESSEL: Yeah, you could say that. We know that not everybody did better during the 2010s, but we know that there were fewer people living in poverty, for instance. And we know that it was a terrific decade to be in the billionaire class.INSKEEP: What has the stock market done, if anything, to income inequality over the last decade?WESSEL: Well, the stock market had a terrific decade. The Standard and Poor's 500 was up nine of the past 10 years, and this year was particularly strong. And what that does is it tends to widen wealth inequality. Income is people's paycheck. Wealth is what they own - stocks, bonds and houses. And because the top 1% hold half of all the stock market wealth in the country, when the stock market goes up, that widens the gap between the wealthy and other people. The 130,000 households at the very top - that's the top one-tenth of 1%, the 50 million and up crowd - hold 15% of all the wealth in America, and there are a lot of Americans who have no wealth at all.But one thing that's really important to most Americans is homeownership - the value of their home, not the stock markets, their major asset. And housing prices have been rising. That's good for people who own houses, not so good for people who want to buy them. But there is one striking disparity - 73% of non-Hispanic whites own their own homes but only 43% of blacks. And that gap has been widening. Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.INSKEEP: What proposals, if any that are out there, would appear to address the root causes?WESSEL: There are things like raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, requiring Uber and Lyft and other gig employers to treat their employees differently, investing in education, nutrition, health care for low-income kids. Those all tend to reduce inequality before taxes.And we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.INSKEEP: Is there any political consensus for redistributing wealth in any way? It's a thing that some Democrats favor but that a lot of Republicans don't.WESSEL: No. I don't think there is a consensus. I think there's widespread acknowledgement that the distribution of income and wealth in America is unequal. What you often hear from people on the right is they want to focus on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. So they are interested in what can we do to give poor people a chance to build a business, go to school, make it into the middle class, and they worry less than the people on the left do about these data that we've been discussing that suggests that the inequality of outcomes has grown.INSKEEP: David Wessel, always a pleasure talking with you.WESSEL: Happy New Year, Steve.INSKEEP: Happy New Year to you.

The 130,000 households at the very top - that's the top one-tenth of 1%, the 50 million and up crowd - hold 15% of all the wealth in America, and there are a lot of Americans who have no wealth at all.But one thing that's really important to most Americans is homeownership - the value of their home, not the stock markets, their major asset. And housing prices have been rising. That's good for people who own houses, not so good for people who want to buy them. But there is one striking disparity - 73% of non-Hispanic whites own their own homes but only 43% of blacks. And that gap has been widening. Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.INSKEEP: What proposals, if any that are out there, would appear to address the root causes?WESSEL: There are things like raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, requiring Uber and Lyft and other gig employers to treat their employees differently, investing in education, nutrition, health care for low-income kids. Those all tend to reduce inequality before taxes.And we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.INSKEEP: Is there any political consensus for redistributing wealth in any way? It's a thing that some Democrats favor but that a lot of Republicans don't.WESSEL: No. I don't think there is a consensus. I think there's widespread acknowledgement that the distribution of income and wealth in America is unequal. What you often hear from people on the right is they want to focus on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. So they are interested in what can we do to give poor people a chance to build a business, go to school, make it into the middle class, and they worry less than the people on the left do about these data that we've been discussing that suggests that the inequality of outcomes has grown.INSKEEP: David Wessel, always a pleasure talking with you.WESSEL: Happy New Year, Steve.INSKEEP: Happy New Year to you.

The 2010s began and ended with pushes against inequality. The Occupy Wall Street movement made headlines back in 2011. And right now, Democratic presidential candidates are pushing ideas like a wealth tax. Even President Trump has made references to some of his supporters as forgotten Americans.The longest economic expansion in U.S. history, which began in 2009, has finally brought up wages. Yet none of this changes the numbers noticed by David Wessel, director of The Hutchins Center at The Brookings Institution. David, welcome back.DAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Good morning.INSKEEP: And happy New Year. What are you seeing in the numbers?WESSEL: Well, most people's economic fortunes did improve during the 2010s as the economy slowly climbed out of this terrible Great Recession. But by almost any measure, the gap between the people at the very top and the rest of us continued to widen. There are a couple of economists at Berkeley - Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman - who've done a lot of work on this, and they say that the income before taxes of the top 1% is now a bigger share of the pie than at any time since the 1920s.And even after you take account of federal taxes and means-tested government programs like Medicare, which take money from the top and give it to people at the bottom, the Congressional Budget Office says that the overall incomes of the bottom fifth of the population rose by 34% after adjusting for inflation during the decade. But the incomes of the top fifth rose by 58%, a lot more.INSKEEP: Now, I'm thinking of that truism about a rising tide lifting all boats. The economy seems to be lifting all boats, but some people are way above the ocean in a private jet.WESSEL: Yeah, you could say that. We know that not everybody did better during the 2010s, but we know that there were fewer people living in poverty, for instance. And we know that it was a terrific decade to be in the billionaire class.INSKEEP: What has the stock market done, if anything, to income inequality over the last decade?WESSEL: Well, the stock market had a terrific decade. The Standard and Poor's 500 was up nine of the past 10 years, and this year was particularly strong. And what that does is it tends to widen wealth inequality. Income is people's paycheck. Wealth is what they own - stocks, bonds and houses. And because the top 1% hold half of all the stock market wealth in the country, when the stock market goes up, that widens the gap between the wealthy and other people.

But the incomes of the top fifth rose by 58%, a lot more.INSKEEP: Now, I'm thinking of that truism about a rising tide lifting all boats. The economy seems to be lifting all boats, but some people are way above the ocean in a private jet.WESSEL: Yeah, you could say that. We know that not everybody did better during the 2010s, but we know that there were fewer people living in poverty, for instance. And we know that it was a terrific decade to be in the billionaire class.INSKEEP: What has the stock market done, if anything, to income inequality over the last decade?WESSEL: Well, the stock market had a terrific decade. The Standard and Poor's 500 was up nine of the past 10 years, and this year was particularly strong. And what that does is it tends to widen wealth inequality. Income is people's paycheck. Wealth is what they own - stocks, bonds and houses. And because the top 1% hold half of all the stock market wealth in the country, when the stock market goes up, that widens the gap between the wealthy and other people. The 130,000 households at the very top - that's the top one-tenth of 1%, the 50 million and up crowd - hold 15% of all the wealth in America, and there are a lot of Americans who have no wealth at all.But one thing that's really important to most Americans is homeownership - the value of their home, not the stock markets, their major asset. And housing prices have been rising. That's good for people who own houses, not so good for people who want to buy them. But there is one striking disparity - 73% of non-Hispanic whites own their own homes but only 43% of blacks. And that gap has been widening. Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.INSKEEP: What proposals, if any that are out there, would appear to address the root causes?WESSEL: There are things like raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, requiring Uber and Lyft and other gig employers to treat their employees differently, investing in education, nutrition, health care for low-income kids. Those all tend to reduce inequality before taxes.And we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.INSKEEP: Is there any political consensus for redistributing wealth in any way? It's a thing that some Democrats favor but that a lot of Republicans don't.WESSEL: No. I don't think there is a consensus. I think there's widespread acknowledgement that the distribution of income and wealth in America is unequal. What you often hear from people on the right is they want to focus on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. So they are interested in what can we do to give poor people a chance to build a business, go to school, make it into the middle class, and they worry less than the people on the left do about these data that we've been discussing that suggests that the inequality of outcomes has grown.INSKEEP: David Wessel, always a pleasure talking with you.WESSEL: Happy New Year, Steve.INSKEEP: Happy New Year to you.

The authoritative record of NPR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programming is the audio record.\n    \n WESSEL: Yeah, you could say that. We know that not everybody did better during the 2010s, but we know that there were fewer people living in poverty, for instance. And we know that it was a terrific decade to be in the billionaire class.INSKEEP: What has the stock market done, if anything, to income inequality over the last decade?WESSEL: Well, the stock market had a terrific decade. The Standard and Poor's 500 was up nine of the past 10 years, and this year was particularly strong. And what that does is it tends to widen wealth inequality. Income is people's paycheck. Wealth is what they own - stocks, bonds and houses. And because the top 1% hold half of all the stock market wealth in the country, when the stock market goes up, that widens the gap between the wealthy and other people. The 130,000 households at the very top - that's the top one-tenth of 1%, the 50 million and up crowd - hold 15% of all the wealth in America, and there are a lot of Americans who have no wealth at all.But one thing that's really important to most Americans is homeownership - the value of their home, not the stock markets, their major asset. And housing prices have been rising. That's good for people who own houses, not so good for people who want to buy them. But there is one striking disparity - 73% of non-Hispanic whites own their own homes but only 43% of blacks. And that gap has been widening. Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.INSKEEP: What proposals, if any that are out there, would appear to address the root causes?WESSEL: There are things like raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, requiring Uber and Lyft and other gig employers to treat their employees differently, investing in education, nutrition, health care for low-income kids. Those all tend to reduce inequality before taxes.And we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.INSKEEP: Is there any political consensus for redistributing wealth in any way? It's a thing that some Democrats favor but that a lot of Republicans don't.WESSEL: No. I don't think there is a consensus. I think there's widespread acknowledgement that the distribution of income and wealth in America is unequal. What you often hear from people on the right is they want to focus on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. So they are interested in what can we do to give poor people a chance to build a business, go to school, make it into the middle class, and they worry less than the people on the left do about these data that we've been discussing that suggests that the inequality of outcomes has grown.INSKEEP: David Wessel, always a pleasure talking with you.WESSEL: Happy New Year, Steve.INSKEEP: Happy New Year to you.

    "onlytext": "What brought about another decade of growing income inequality in the United States? The 2010s began and ended with pushes against inequality. The Occupy Wall Street movement made headlines back in 2011. And right now, Democratic presidential candidates are pushing ideas like a wealth tax. Even President Trump has made references to some of his supporters as forgotten Americans.\n\nThe longest economic expansion in U.S. history, which began in 2009, has finally brought up wages. Yet none of this changes the numbers noticed by David Wessel, director of The Hutchins Center at The Brookings Institution. David, welcome back.\n\nDAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: And happy New Year. What are you seeing in the numbers?\n\nWESSEL: Well, most people's economic fortunes did improve during the 2010s as the economy slowly climbed out of this terrible Great Recession. But by almost any measure, the gap between the people at the very top and the rest of us continued to widen. There are a couple of economists at Berkeley - Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman - who've done a lot of work on this, and they say that the income before taxes of the top 1% is now a bigger share of the pie than at any time since the 1920s.\n\nAnd even after you take account of federal taxes and means-tested government programs like Medicare, which take money from the top and give it to people at the bottom, the Congressional Budget Office says that the overall incomes of the bottom fifth of the population rose by 34% after adjusting for inflation during the decade. But the incomes of the top fifth rose by 58%, a lot more.\n\nINSKEEP: Now, I'm thinking of that truism about a rising tide lifting all boats. The economy seems to be lifting all boats, but some people are way above the ocean in a private jet.\n\nWESSEL: Yeah, you could say that. We know that not everybody did better during the 2010s, but we know that there were fewer people living in poverty, for instance. And we know that it was a terrific decade to be in the billionaire class.\n\nINSKEEP: What has the stock market done, if anything, to income inequality over the last decade?\n\nWESSEL: Well, the stock market had a terrific decade. The Standard and Poor's 500 was up nine of the past 10 years, and this year was particularly strong. And what that does is it tends to widen wealth inequality. Income is people's paycheck. Wealth is what they own - stocks, bonds and houses. And because the top 1% hold half of all the stock market wealth in the country, when the stock market goes up, that widens the gap between the wealthy and other people. The 130,000 households at the very top - that's the top one-tenth of 1%, the 50 million and up crowd - hold 15% of all the wealth in America, and there are a lot of Americans who have no wealth at all.\n\nBut one thing that's really important to most Americans is homeownership - the value of their home, not the stock markets, their major asset. And housing prices have been rising. That's good for people who own houses, not so good for people who want to buy them. But there is one striking disparity - 73% of non-Hispanic whites own their own homes but only 43% of blacks. And that gap has been widening. Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.\n\nINSKEEP: What proposals, if any that are out there, would appear to address the root causes?\n\nWESSEL: There are things like raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, requiring Uber and Lyft and other gig employers to treat their employees differently, investing in education, nutrition, health care for low-income kids. Those all tend to reduce inequality before taxes.\n\nAnd we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.\n\nINSKEEP: Is there any political consensus for redistributing wealth in any way? It's a thing that some Democrats favor but that a lot of Republicans don't.\n\nWESSEL: No. I don't think there is a consensus. I think there's widespread acknowledgement that the distribution of income and wealth in America is unequal. What you often hear from people on the right is they want to focus on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. So they are interested in what can we do to give poor people a chance to build a business, go to school, make it into the middle class, and they worry less than the people on the left do about these data that we've been discussing that suggests that the inequality of outcomes has grown.\n\nINSKEEP: David Wessel, always a pleasure talking with you.\n\nWESSEL: Happy New Year, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: Happy New Year to you.

    "domain": "cnbc.com",
    "text": "The wealth gap between rich millennials and the rest of their age group is the largest of any generation, creating a new wave of class tension and resentment, according to a\u00a0recent study.\nEven as the vast majority of millennials struggle with student debt, low-wage service-jobs, unaffordable housing and low savings, the millennial elite are surpassing previous generations. According to the study, the average millennial has 30% less wealth at the age of 35 than baby boomers did at the same age. Yet the top 10% of millennials have 20% more wealth than the top baby boomers at the same age.\n\u201cMillennials are so different from one another that it is not particularly meaningful to talk about the \u2018average\u2019 Millennial experience,\u201d wrote the study\u2019s authors, Rob Gruijters, Zachary Van Winkle and Anette Eva Fasang. \u201cThere are some Millennials who are doing extremely well\u2014think Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman\u2014while others are struggling.\u201d\nThe study finds that millennials \u2014 typically defined as those between the age of 28 and 43 today \u2014 have faced repeated financial headwinds. Coming of age during the financial crisis, they have lower levels of homeownership, larger debts outweighing assets, low-wage and unstable jobs, and lower rates of dual-income family formation.\nAt the same time, the authors say the top 10% of millennials have benefited from greater rewards for skilled jobs. As they put it, \u201cThe returns to high-status work trajectories have increased, while the returns to low-status trajectories have stagnated or declined.\u201d\nThe millennials who \u201cwent to college, found graduate level jobs, and started families relatively late,\u201d ended up with \u201chigher levels of wealth than Baby Boomers with similar life trajectories,\u201d according to the report.\nThe great wealth transfer\nThere may be another factor creating so much wealth among millennials: inheritances. In what\u2019s known as \u201cthe great wealth transfer,\u201d baby boomers are expected to pass down between $70 trillion and $90 trillion in wealth over the next 20 years. Much of that is expected to go to their millennial children. High-net-worth individuals worth $5 million or more will account for nearly half of that total, according to Cerulli Associates.\nWealth management firms say some of that wealth has already starting trickling down to the next generation.\n\u201cThe great wealth transfer, which we\u2019ve all been talking about for the last 10 years, is underway,\u201d said John Mathews, head of UBS\u2019\u00a0Private Wealth Management division. \u201cThe average age of the world\u2019s billionaires is almost 69 right now. So this whole transition or wealth handover will start to accelerate.\u201d\nTensions between millennial classes are likely to escalate as more wealth is transferred in the coming years. Wealth displays on social media by millennial \u201cnepo babies\u201d could add to the intra-generational class war and drive nonwealthy millennials to overspend or create the appearance of lavish lifestyles to keep up.\nA survey by Wells Fargo found that 29% of affluent millennials (defined as having assets of $250,000 to over $1 million of investible assets) admit they \u201csometimes buy items they cannot afford to impress others.\u201d According to the survey, 41% of affluent millennials admit to funding their lifestyles with credit cards or loans, versus 28% of Gen Xers and 6% of baby boomers.\nThe battle between rich millennials and the rest could also shape their attitudes toward wealth. For over four decades, the vast majority of millionaires and billionaires created in America have been self-made, mostly entrepreneurs. A study by Fidelity Investments found that 88% of American millionaires are self-made.\nYet inherited wealth could become more common. A study by UBS found that among newly minted billionaires last year, heirs who inherited their fortunes racked up more wealth than self-made billionaires for the first time in at least nine years. And, all the billionaires under the age of 30 on the latest Forbes billionaires list inherited their wealth, for the first time in 15 years.\n\u2018Extreme\u2019 wealth\nThe surge in wealth among millennial heirs is also creating a lucrative new market for wealth-management firms, luxury companies, travel firms and real estate brokers.\nClayton Orrigo, one of the top luxury real estate brokers in Manhattan, has built a thriving business on moneyed millennials. The founder of the Hudson Advisory Team at Compass has sold over $4 billion in real estate and regularly brokers deals over $10 million. He says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of his business lately is from buyers in their 20s and 30s with inherited wealth.\n\u201cI just sold a $16 million apartment to someone in their mid-20s, and the buyer accessed the family trust,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wealth that is behind these kids is extreme.\u201d\nInherited wealth has become Orrigo\u2019s specialty. He says he works on forging close relationships with family offices, trusts and young money elite mingling at New York membership clubs like Casa Cipriani.\nThe pattern is familiar: A wealthy family calls wanting a rental for their son or daughter; a few years later, they want a $5 million or $10 million two-bedroom condo to buy in a new, high-security building downtown.\n\u201cMy gig is working very quietly and very discreetly with the wealthiest families in the world,\u201d Orrigo said.",

    "text": "In June 2010,\u00a0Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates and\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0started what could be described as the world\u2019s most ambitious fundraising drive. After promising to give away the vast majority of their wealth, the trio asked their ultra-wealthy peers to pledge at least half of their assets to charity during their lifetimes or in their estates.\nIn two months, the Giving Pledge garnered signatures from 40 of America\u2019s richest families and individuals to sign up. That first batch of pledgers, including Michael Bloomberg and David Rockefeller, was announced 15 years ago this week.\nIn the years since, the Giving Pledge has lost steam when it comes to enrollment. By the end of 2010, 57 signatories representing an estimated 14% of America\u2019s billionaires had made the nonbinding commitment, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0by the Institute for Policy Studies. Currently, the pledge has commitments from 256 individuals, couples and families, including 110 American billionaires, per the progressive think tank. This group makes up 12% of the U.S. billionaire population as estimated by\u00a0Forbes.\nThe annual number of sign-ups has also flagged since that first year. Even in 2020 when the pandemic spurred wealthy donors to give more, the Giving Pledge only earned 12 new signatories. This past May, the pledge welcomed 11 new members, a marked improvement over 2024\u2032s record low of four.\nMeanwhile, over the past 10 years, the\u00a0number of billionaires\u00a0worldwide has increased by more than half to 2,891, according to UBS. Their wealth also doubled by more than half to an estimated $15.7 trillion, UBS said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing in that you would hope more people would step up,\u201d said\u00a0Chuck Collins, program director at the IPS and great-grandson of the meatpacker Oscar Mayer.\nCollins, a co-author of the report, said the rapid increase in wealth may be partly to blame. This surge in wealth has also made it challenging for the pledgers to give away their money fast enough.\n\u201cSome of this is fairly sudden, the wealth growth,\u201d he said, \u201cso you got to give people ... a decade of slack, if you just land in the billionaire class to figure it out.\u201d\nWhether the Giving Pledge has been successful depends on whom you ask. The IPS report described the Giving Pledge as \u201cunfulfilled, unfulfillable, and not our ticket to a fairer, better future\u201d and identified only one living couple to have fulfilled the pledge, John and Laura Arnold.\nA spokesperson for the Giving Pledge described the IPS report as \u201cmisleading,\u201d and said the IPS used incomplete data and excluded \u201csignificant forms of charitable giving,\u201d including gifts to foundations.\n\u201cFor fifteen years, the Giving Pledge has helped create new norms of generosity and grown into a connected and active global learning community,\u201d a spokesperson wrote in a statement to Inside Wealth.\nCollins said the Giving Pledge has some merit, describing it as a \u201ccommunity of peers among a group who don\u2019t have a lot of peers.\u201d\nAmir Pasic, dean of the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, said it has had a lasting impact on how the wealthy think about their giving.\n\u201cI still think that it was really important attempt to socialize the new wealth that was emerging early on in this century,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can interestingly debate how successful it has or hasn\u2019t been, but it\u2019s become a feature of the high-net-worth philanthropic landscape.\u201d\nThough Giving Pledge enrollment has stagnated, other efforts to accelerate giving have emerged, said Pasic, citing the collective Blue Meridian Partners.\nAnd while some billionaires, particularly younger ones, may be reluctant to associate themselves with the Gateses and Buffett, it doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t contributing in their own way, Pasic said.\n\u201cBuffett is the senior representative of new wealth at the beginning of this century. New representatives have emerged since then,\u201d he said.\nAccording to Collins,\u00a0impact investing\u00a0and other alternatives to traditional philanthropy have gained traction, especially among the new class of tech billionaires. He gave the example of\u00a0Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison\u00a0amending his pledge\u00a0to focus his resources on technology research instead of traditional nonprofit organizations.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a little more blurring between for profit and nonprofit, charity versus impact investing,\u201d Collins said.\nVenture capital billionaire Marc Andreessen has gone so far as to declare that innovating technology \u2014 and amassing personal riches in the process \u2014 is philanthropic in and of itself.\n\u201cWho gets more value from a new technology, the single company that makes it, or the millions or billions of people who use it to improve their lives?

After promising to give away the vast majority of their wealth, the trio asked their ultra-wealthy peers to pledge at least half of their assets to charity during their lifetimes or in their estates.\nIn two months, the Giving Pledge garnered signatures from 40 of America\u2019s richest families and individuals to sign up. That first batch of pledgers, including Michael Bloomberg and David Rockefeller, was announced 15 years ago this week.\nIn the years since, the Giving Pledge has lost steam when it comes to enrollment.

    "text": "I\u2019ve been following debates on guaranteed income for almost a decade, and one thing that\u2019s stood out is that\u00a0universal basic income\u00a0(UBI), a regular cash payment to all citizens with no strings attached, is like a Rorschach test.\nSome people see UBI as a \u201ccapitalist road to communism\u201d or a world\u00a0free of work. Others see everything from a means of unleashing the population\u2019s\u00a0creative potential\u00a0to a policy that would undermine human agency and erode \u201cpsychological capital.\u201d Some see it as a way to\u00a0shore up the welfare state. Others, a way to\u00a0bulldoze it.\nIn part, that\u2019s because unless you pin down the details, basic income is too vague to mean anything politically concrete. Like the Rorschach inkblot, you can interpret and design UBI in an endless variety of ways. A\u00a0program\u00a0that provides $250 per month is a different ballgame than one\u00a0providing $1,200 per month. The same goes for one that replaces\u00a0all\u00a0other welfare, like food aid (sometimes referred to as\u00a0a \u201cpure UBI,\u201d which would actually leave the most disadvantaged worse off, and is a bad idea), compared with one that complements existing programs.\nUltimately, the effects of any income guarantee hinge on the details. How much does it pay? Who gets it? How\u2019s it financed? How does it relate to the rest of the welfare state? But most of the\u00a0real proposals\u00a0that have made their way through the policy world share a noteworthy trait: When the dust settles, they just wouldn\u2019t be that radical, in either direction.\nGenerally, most people at the bottom of the income ladder would be better off, those in the middle would break even as they pay about as much in higher taxes as they\u2019d receive from the basic income, and those at the top would be a little worse off. Society would neither ascend into utopian communism nor collapse into bleak idleness. There would just be less poverty and higher taxes.\nI see this as good news. If basic income won\u2019t be the silver bullet that changes \u2014 or destroys \u2014 society, it becomes something far more politically tractable: a moderately effective policy, albeit one with trade-offs, that is well worth considering.\nThe many faces of basic income\nAmong actual basic income proposals, some definitely have more of a radical edge than others. But not in terms of their economic effects. What\u2019s radical about imagining a $1,000 per month UBI isn\u2019t so much how it\u2019d affect the\u00a0economy\u00a0\u2014 again, some would be better off, others would break even, others would be worse off. It\u2019s how to get a program with a $3 trillion price tag through a\u00a0Congress\u00a0that couldn\u2019t even solidify an\u00a0incredibly successful\u00a0basic income for children \u2014 the temporarily expanded child tax credit \u2014 that only cost\u00a0about $100 billion.\nEven if the $3 trillion version were to pass, perhaps by effectively communicating how taxing some of the benefits back would\u00a0lower the program\u2019s net cost, the result would land US federal spending as a percentage of GDP\u00a0right around where\u00a0France and Scandinavian countries already sit. Which is to say, from the perspective of other social democracies, that level of spending would be normal.\nOne way to blunt the more radical politics of UBI is to style the income guarantee as a negative income tax (NIT) instead. The main difference is that NIT\u2019s are means-tested, phasing out their benefit levels as earned income rises. Doing so could lower the sticker price while achieving\u00a0basically the same\u00a0economic effects as a UBI considered together with higher taxes, which claw back the benefits to achieve a similar effect as the NIT means-test phasing them out.\nFor example,\u00a0one 2021 proposal\u00a0outlined an NIT-style basic income that guaranteed $12,500 to all adults (plus an additional $4,500 per child). The benefit would begin phasing out when household income (calculated for two-adult households) reaches $15,000, and would zero out at a household income of $70,000. It was estimated to cost $876 billion per year. Compare that to the $3-or-so trillion of high-end UBI proposals that guarantee a similar amount.\nSince NIT can be made equivalent in distribution to UBI, but the politics lean in favor of the former, there\u2019s an argument to be made that NIT is the realistic path forward. \u201cA leading task for the left is to legitimize the notion of a new NIT,\u201d writes the economist Max Sawicky in\u00a0an excellent overview piece. \u201cThere are genuine ways to attenuate the power of Capital \u2026 The na\u00efve version of UBI isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d\nThere are, of course, other trade-offs to consider. NIT imposes a hefty administrative burden, where monthly payments would have to be tuned to fluctuating incomes. There may also be\u00a0a psychological difference\u00a0between phasing out benefits and paying higher taxes.\nBut if you put that whole debate aside and keep poking at the economic effects of UBI, its radical mystique continues to dissipate.\nThe general pattern of basic income\u2019s economic impact\nAs my colleague\u00a0Dylan Matthews wrote, \u201cwhether or not basic income is a good idea depends entirely on how you pay for it.\u201d In addition, when you look at UBI together with however you propose to pay for it, you begin to see through the radical veil.\nConsider one of the most common pairings: paying for UBI with a value-added tax (VAT \u2014 sorry, another acronym), a type of consumption tax used across\u00a0170 countries worldwide, including all of Europe, leveled on all purchases, including goods and services.\nThe economist William Gale\u00a0ran the numbers\u00a0on coupling a 10 percent VAT with a UBI payout that would range from $2,500 for individuals to about $5,200 for a family of four. The results look like this:\nThe poorest 20 percent of Americans would see their after-tax income rise about 17 percent \u2014 a significant anti-poverty gain. The next 20 percent of Americans would see only a modest gain, roughly 5 percent. The middle 20 percent would experience basically no change. The gains from their UBI would almost perfectly cancel out the higher tax rates they\u2019d pay. And the remaining upper classes would see modest decreases in income, with the tax costs outstripping their UBI benefits.\nWhile the numbers will vary based on the details of the proposal, the trend\u00a0is general: broad-based taxation coupled with a universal payout, the basic formula of most realistic UBI proposals, tends to leave those at the bottom better off, those in the middle about even, and those at the top a little worse off. It\u2019s not incredibly radical \u2014 it\u2019s just an effective anti-poverty policy.\nTurning to the macroeconometric models that economists use to predict how various policy changes might affect the economy, you\u2019ll find a similar story. Whether predicting the effects of a tax-funded UBI with the progressive-leaning\u00a0Levy Institute model\u00a0or the more centered\u00a0Penn Wharton Budget Model, GDP and employment rates neither balloon nor crater. Neither model foretells an upheaval in the economic order of things, just a few percentage points in one direction or the other.\nWe also have suggestive empirical evidence from 2021, the year we had that UBI for kids. The results were as follows:\u00a0struggling families found it easier\u00a0to feed their children, pay their utility bills, invest in education, and pay the rent. Employment rates\u00a0hardly budged, moving us no closer \u2014 or farther away, depending on your tastes \u2014 to a world without work. (Though, to be fair, a program everyone knows is temporary\u00a0likely has less impact\u00a0on employment than if it were permanent.)\nRadical ideas have their place. They can stretch our collective imagination, and keep us from falling\u00a0victim to the belief\u00a0that there are no fundamental alternatives to the present arrangement of our world. But basic income doesn\u2019t have to be one of them, and shedding that association offers at least two payoffs.\nIt could bring basic income further into the realm of pragmatic policy analysis, where wonks of all stripes present their views on whether or not the programs\u2019 tradeoffs are worth it. Second, for those who want to elevate their sights on radical possibilities that might exceed political realities, why not dream bigger?",

    "text": "The idea of free cash for all may seem too good to be true, but a growing number of high-profile people \u2014 from Democratic presidential hopeful\u00a0Andrew Yang\u00a0to tech billionaire\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0\u2014 say universal basic income, or UBI, may become a reality.\nAnd the rest of America is becoming more interested, too: Google searches for the term \u201cuniversal basic income\u201d have multiplied as much as 50 times between 2015 and 2019.\nWhat is UBI?\nUniversal basic income refers to regular cash payments made to a given population (such as adult U.S. citizens, for example) with minimal or no requirements for receiving the money, in order to increase people\u2019s income, according to the\u00a0International Monetary Fund.\nBeyond that, however, there is often disagreement about what constitutes UBI.\n\u2033[T]here is no established common understanding\u201d of UBI, according to\u00a0economists Maura Francese and Delphine Prady. And therefore, \u201cvery different income-support programs are often labeled \u2018universal basic income,\u2019 even when they have little in common or do not aim at the same goal.\u201d\nHowever,\u00a0common variances\u00a0on the basic tenet include whether cash handouts replace or supplement existing social welfare programs, whether payments are distributed to a household or individual, who foots the bill and how often the payments are distributed.\nWhy is everybody talking about UBI now?\nThere are two main conditions fueling the emergence of UBI as a serious topic over the last few years.\nThe first is fears that automation will put millions of people out of work, leaving them with little or no income.\n\u201cThere is a pretty good chance we end up with a universal basic income, or something like that, due to automation,\u201d SpaceX and\u00a0Tesla\u00a0boss\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0told CNBC\u00a0in 2016. \u201cYeah, I am not sure what else one would do. I think that is what would happen.\u201d\nThis is Andrew Yang\u2019s thinking too. Yang, a 44-year-old entrepreneur running for the Democratic presidential nomination, has made UBI the foundation of his 2020 campaign platform. His plan, which he calls the \u201cFreedom Dividend,\u201d is for the federal government to give all U.S. citizens ages 18 and over $1,000 per month.\nFellow Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders said\u00a0in 2015\u00a0he is \u201cabsolutely sympathetic to that approach,\u201d and former Vice President Joe Biden said in 2018 he would\u00a0consider a UBI as a last resort. Republicans are more likely to be against UBI.\nAmericans, however, are split on whether they would support universal basic income as a solution for those whose jobs are replaced by robots: 48% support and 52% do not, according to a February 2018\u00a0Gallup survey.\nThere is also debate as to whether robots will actually take people\u2019s jobs: A\u00a02017 McKinsey & Company report\u00a0estimates as much as one-third of the U.S. workforce may need to learn new skills and find a new job because of automation by 2030, while a 2017 report from Gartner says artificial intelligence\u00a0will create more jobs than it eliminates.\nThe other major situation motivating the current conversation about UBI is America\u2019s extreme\u00a0and growing\u00a0wealth inequality. Some see cash payments as a way to help even the playing field.\nFacebook\u00a0founder\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg, for one, falls into this camp.\n\u201cEvery generation expands its definition of equality. Now it\u2019s time for our generation to define a new social contract .... We should explore ideas like universal basic income to make sure everyone has a cushion to try new ideas,\u201d Zuckerberg said in his 2017\u00a0Harvard commencement speech. After all, he said, it was because he had a financial safety net from his dentist father that he felt free to try something as risky as turning Facebook into a business.\nThe wave of interest in UBI is also inspiring a smattering of experiments and pilot studies with UBI in the U.S.\nThe\u00a0once-bankrupt\u00a0town of Stockton, California, initiated an 18-month experiment in\u00a0February, distributing monthly checks for\u00a0$500 to 130\u00a0randomly selected Stockton residents to\u00a0mitigate poverty and inequality. Michael Tubbs, the town\u2019s now 28-year-old mayor, decided on the program after reading Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s 1967 book, \u201cWhere Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?\u201d In the book, King writes: \u201d... the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.\u201d\nAnd one of the country\u2019s top start-up accelerators\u2019 research arm, Y Combinator Research, has run\u00a0small-scale tests in Oakland, California, to test and improve procedures ahead of a larger-scale program. In that program, 1,000 randomly selected individuals across two as-yet-undisclosed states will receive\u00a0$1,000 per month for three years\u00a0to study the impact of the cash transfer.\nWho pays?\nThat depends on who you talk to.\nHillary Clinton seriously considered running her 2016 campaign for president on a platform built with UBI. But she couldn\u2019t figure out a reasonable way to pay for it.\n\u201cUnfortunately, we couldn\u2019t make the numbers work,\u201d\u00a0Clinton wrote\u00a0in her campaign memoir, \u201cWhat Happened.\u201d \u201cTo provide a meaningful dividend each year to every citizen, you\u2019d have to raise enormous sums of money, and that would either mean a lot of new taxes or cannibalizing other important programs. We decided it was exciting but not realistic....\u201d\nOthers believe there is a solution.\nFacebook co-founder Chris Hughes, a UBI supporter, says a guaranteed basic income should be paid for by\u00a0the wealthiest 1% of society, according to his book, \u201cFair Shot: Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn.\u201d\nTWEET: Recurring cash payments, directly to the people who need it most, are a proven tool to beat back against the rising tide of #IncomeInequality.\nAnd Yang proposes to pay for UBI by implementing a value-added tax, or VAT, of 10% on goods and services a company produces. \u201cBecause our economy is so vast, this would generate between $700 and $800 billion in revenue,\u201d he said\u00a0on Reddit\u00a0in 2018. Indeed,\u00a0Eric Toder\u00a0of the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Policy Center told CNBC Make It in 2018 that such a VAT in the United States could raise anywhere from $500 billion to $1 trillion, depending on how broadly the tax is applied.\nOne thing is certain, however: It would cost a lot.\n\u201cA truly universal UBI would be enormously expensive,\u201d say\u00a0Hilary Hoynes\u00a0and\u00a0Jesse Rothstein, economics and public policy professors at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cThe kinds of UBIs often discussed would cost nearly double current total spending on the \u2018big three\u2019 programs (Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid),\u201d according to their\u00a0working paper\u00a0published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in February. They also say these social welfare programs would still be needed even with UBI.\nWill it work?\nCritics say universal basic income is too expensive, that it gives people incentive to be unproductive, that it\u2019s bad for people\u2019s self-worth and that there are more efficient ways to spend government money to help those who can\u2019t support themselves.\n\u201cJust giving $1,000 to everybody in itself is not the right solution\u201d if helping those who need it most in society is the goal, Thomas Piketty, an economist and professor at the Paris School of Economics, told\u00a0CNBC Make It\u00a0at Columbia University in March.\nAnd Ian Goldin, a professor of globalization and development at the University of Oxford,\u00a0argued in the Financial Times\u00a0that \u201cindividuals gain not only income, but meaning, status, skills, networks and friendships through work. Delinking income and work, while rewarding people for staying at home, is what lies behind social decay.\u201d\nNobel laureate in economics Joseph Stiglitz told CNBC in April, \u201cI think there\u2019s a certain dignity from work. Some of my younger students say, \u2018Oh there could be a lot of dignity from meditation and from other ways of spending time.\u2019 But I think for most people there will be a real desire to work,\u201d Stiglitz says.\nAs far as the data goes, it\u2019s mixed.\nSome of the news seems positive. For example, left-leaning think tank\u00a0Roosevelt Institute\u00a0says a $1,000-a-month payment would actually grow the economy by $2.5 trillion by 2025 if it was paid for by increasing the federal deficit; however, increasing taxes would have no net benefit to the economy.\nAnd some small UBI use cases seem to show that cash handouts help those who receive them in some ways \u2014 alleviating emotional stress and helping individuals pay their bills. However, it is not a silver bullet for unemployment.\nFor instance,\u00a0preliminary results\u00a0of a two-year experiment in Finland that gave 2,000 unemployed people 560 euros ($638) a month show that, for the first year of the study, 2017, those getting cash payments reported improved well-being. However, there was no effect on employment status. Results for employment status in 2018, the second year of the study, are not yet available.\nA basic income pilot program in Ontario, Canada,\u00a0launched in April 2017\u00a0with a plan to distribute varying monthly payments to\u00a0more than 4,000 people\u00a0living on incomes less than $34,000 Canadian (or about $25,925 U.S.) for up to three years via tax credits. In July, the\u00a0government of Ontario announced\u00a0it would shut down the program (due to the\u00a0cost\u00a0and a change in government leadership), and in August, it said that payments would run through March. But the advocacy group Basic Income Canada Network got some\u00a0feedback. Responses from 424\u00a0participants\u00a0indicated the payments gave them increased personal agency, relief from anxiety, increased social connection and the ability to invest in things like education and job-hunting.\nThen there are the\u00a0residents\u00a0of Alaska, who receive a yearly dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which was launched in 1982 to pass along oil profits to future generations. In 2018, the payment was\u00a0$1,600. Alaskans\u00a0reportedly\u00a0use the money for everything from heating oil and clothing to medical emergencies, travel and student loan payments. And a 2018\u00a0study\u00a0of Alaskans suggests that \u201ca universal and permanent cash transfer does not significantly decrease aggregate employment.\u201d",

Responses from 424\u00a0participants\u00a0indicated the payments gave them increased personal agency, relief from anxiety, increased social connection and the ability to invest in things like education and job-hunting.\nThen there are the\u00a0residents\u00a0of Alaska, who receive a yearly dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which was launched in 1982 to pass along oil profits to future generations. In 2018, the payment was\u00a0$1,600. Alaskans\u00a0reportedly\u00a0use the money for everything from heating oil and clothing to medical emergencies, travel and student loan payments. And a 2018\u00a0study\u00a0of Alaskans suggests that \u201ca universal and permanent cash transfer does not significantly decrease aggregate employment.\u201d",

    "text": "America is more prosperous than ever.\nU.S. household net worth\u00a0reached a new peak\u00a0at the end of 2024. The unemployment rate has levitated just above record lows for three years. The overall debt that households are carrying compared with the assets they own is also\u00a0near a record low.\nBut even a land of plenty has its shortcomings, influencing both perceptions and realities of how Americans are doing.\nThe U.S. economy remains deeply unequal, with vast gaps in wealth and\u00a0financial security\u00a0persisting even as inflation has ebbed and incomes have risen. And data designed to capture the overall population may be obscuring challenges experienced by a broad range of Americans, especially those in the bottom half of the wealth or income spectrum.\nThe\u00a0share of wealth held by families\u00a0in the top 10 percent has reached 69 percent, while the share held by families in the bottom 50 percent is only 3 percent, according to the\u00a0latest reading from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. (When future income claims from Social Security benefits are included, the bottom 50 percent hold 6 percent of total wealth.)\nAnd while wealth has risen for the less wealthy half of the population in recent years, much of the uptick has been locked up in what financial analysts call \u201cilliquid assets\u201d \u2014 gains in home prices and\u00a0stock portfolios\u00a0\u2014 which are not easily translated into cash to pay for bills and expenses that are much higher than they were a few years ago.\nAlthough\u00a0the bottom 50 percent holds\u00a0only a 1 percent share of all financial market wealth,\u00a0six in 10 adults\u00a0report owning some amount of stock. A broad range of Americans may be frustrated by the inaccessibility of this illiquid wealth, said Daniel Sullivan, research director at the JPMorganChase Institute, which tracks the finances of millions of U.S. bank account holders.\n\u201c\u2018Massive home equity gains, and my 401(k) is way up, but I can\u2019t touch that, either!\u2019\u201d Mr. Sullivan explained, channeling the tension many people feel.\nDespite the growth in overall wealth, economic confidence among American households has not returned to where it was before the pandemic. That was the case even before consumer sentiment readings \u2014 along with the stock market \u2014 were dampened by the prospect of an inflationary global trade war from President Trump\u2019s tariff campaign. But what is also striking in the data is the increasing gap in perceptions along income lines.\nOver the past four years, the University of Michigan\u2019s monthly survey of consumer sentiment has shown those in the bottom two-thirds of income to be deeply pessimistic about the economy \u2014 with rock-bottom ratings more common during periods of deep recession, including the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn contrast, sentiment among the top third of earners recently rebounded after falling from prepandemic levels.\n\u201cHigher-income people drive most of aggregate spending,\u201d said Joanne Hsu, an economist and director of the Michigan survey. \u201cThey were on an upward surge of sentiment between 2022 and 2024, and that\u2019s consistent with their strong spending.\u201d\nPart of the disconnect may stem from the tendency among economists to track income progress primarily through percentage change rather than dollar amounts.\nEven when inflation was peaking around 9 percent and diluting income growth, Ms. Hsu explained, \u201ca 10 percent boost to middle and especially higher incomes is money that feels real, like you can do something with it.\u201d\nFor someone making $100,000, that means a $10,000 raise. But a 10 percent increase at the bottom, perhaps to an hourly wage of $16.50 from $15, \u201cmeans you\u2019re still living hand-to-mouth,\u201d she added.\nIn a recent report, Matt Bruenig, the president of the People\u2019s Policy Project, a liberal think tank, evaluated the long-running question in U.S. economics of how many adults are living paycheck to paycheck \u2014 a term plagued, he said, by \u201cinherent ambiguities.\u201d\nDrawing on data\u00a0from the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, conducted annually by the Federal Reserve Board, Mr. Bruenig noted that \u201cif we define someone as living paycheck to paycheck if they\u00a0either\u00a0say they do not have three months of emergency savings\u00a0or\u00a0say they cannot afford a $2,000 emergency expense,\u201d then 59 percent of American adults are \u201cliving paycheck to paycheck.\u201d\n\u2018Loss Aversion\u2019\nOne force behind the lingering dour mood may be more psychic, more intangible, than economic data can easily detect, according to Chris Wheat, the president of the JPMorganChase Institute.\nLess wealthy Americans, both middle and working class, he said, may still be reckoning with \u201cthe psychological effect\u201d of the volatility brought about by the pandemic and postpandemic period of 2020 to 2023, which brought both positive and negative swings in cash savings.\nLump sums of direct federal aid in 2020 and 2021 helped tens of millions of households pay down debts, save more of their income and get a brief taste of what living standards were like well above their usual income.\nThat aid, as expected, ended. And there has been a harsh comedown from those highs.\nInflation-adjusted income and inflation-adjusted spending for the typical household fell significantly from 2021 to 2023, research from the JPMorganChase Institute found, using data from more than eight million bank account holders. In essence, purchasing power decreased.\nDuring the same period, checking account balances remained in a historically healthy position across all income cohorts. Yet cash savings have fallen ever since peaking in 2021.\nA variety of goods and services have become more expensive, \u201cbut people\u2019s spending habits didn\u2019t change,\u201d Mr. Wheat said.\nWhen financial gravity resumed, lower- and middle-income households that had received aid were forced to resume relying primarily on their labor income to cover expenses.\nThat, Mr. Wheat said, appears to have prompted a serious case of what both psychologists and economists call \u201closs aversion\u201d \u2014 the human proneness to more painfully feel what has been lost than to notice what has been gained. The earnings growth that most workers captured,\u00a0to average hourly earnings of $31\u00a0in January 2025 from $23 in January 2019, didn\u2019t feel as good as inflation felt bad.\nMost economists believe it was appropriate for the extraordinary aid of 2020-21 that enlarged household bank accounts to end. And some argued that it should have ended sooner.\nBut being nudged back into tighter budgeting again, after gaining more financial breathing room, however briefly, can be \u201cfrustrating,\u201d Mr. Wheat noted.\nHouse-Rich(er), Cash-Thin(ner)\nHome prices have boomed since 2020. And\u00a0about half\u00a0the net worth of the less wealthy 50 percent is in real estate. But the major boost in home prices experienced by owners in this half of the population has often not been felt.\nFor one, a higher home appraisal cannot cover higher grocery bills. And with interest rates high and housing scarce, it is often infeasible to buy a first home or move to another one.\nThat, too, is probably suppressing economic sentiment among those with fewer financial resources in their family, Ms. Hsu of the University of Michigan said.\nThe homeownership rate for adults under 35, which peaked in 1980 at 50 percent,\u00a0has fallen\u00a0to 30 percent. Estimates\u00a0from economists at the National Association of Home Builders in 2024\u00a0indicated that about half of American households\u00a0could not afford a $250,000 home\u00a0and that a large majority could not afford a median-priced home, now $419,000.\nThe state of the housing market \u2014 largely frozen for about three years \u2014 may be dimming the economic outlook of even higher-income families. A large crop of homeowners over the past couple of years have been looking to move, for family or work. Rationally, they cherish their cheap, fixed-rate mortgages from the era of lower interest rates, and catch sticker shock at the prospective monthly payment for a similar home at present rates and prices.\nOne fascinating divot in the broader personal finance landscape, however, is that elevated interest rates \u2014 which have a dampening effect on industries like housing \u2014 have given\u00a0a major personal income boost to millions of households, if only those that have an ability to save (after taxes and expenses).\nResearch teams at large U.S. banks are finding that these savers are allocating a greater proportion of their cash balances to high-yield savings accounts that earn more interest, a direct result of higher interest rates.\u00a0Personal interest income hit a record\u00a0high of $2.1 trillion in January.\nSo for high-income households, total cash reserves are most likely much higher even if checking account balances are down, a report from the JPMorganChase Institute notes.\nFor lower-income bank account holders, \u201cit\u2019s not dark, but it\u2019s not quite as rosy,\u201d Mr. Sullivan concluded.\nThe Shadow of Tariffs\nHistorically, consumer sentiment tends to improve after an inflation shock, or a recession, with the passage of time during economic expansions. It gives households a chance to adjust to new prices, or a new job market, and move forward.\nBut a large and diverse group of economists and investors are arguing that the zigzagging nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff campaign is needlessly adding inflation danger and growth uncertainty to the relatively stable path that the economy was on before he re-entered office.\nThe financial market sell-off this past month and recent plummets in sentiment have \u201cbeen driven by policy uncertainty largely stemming from tariffs and tariff threats,\u201d said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.\nThe president and his advisers, however, have presented any potential recession, or uptick in consumer inflation\u00a0that may result from their policies, as a price that may need to be paid for the economy to emerge stronger.\nBelief in Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to steer the economy played a key part in his election victory. And he promised to lower prices and ease the cost of living upon entering office. But public approval of his handling of the economy is only 39 percent, with just 32 percent of respondents\u00a0approving of his approach to the cost of living, according to\u00a0Reuters/Ipsos polling.\nFinancial forecasters at major Wall Street firms have, for their part, taken their previously low recession probability ratings\u00a0and raised them significantly.\nBut several analysts remain focused less on recession calls than on trying to make sense of why so many people are feeling down about their economic lives.\nOwen Davis, a labor economist and research fellow at\u00a0the Siegel Family Endowment\u00a0\u2014 a nonprofit that funds education and work force research \u2014 believes that questions of economic dissatisfaction and the constant deliberation in recent years over whether the U.S. economy is, or isn\u2019t, heading into a recession \u201coften get lumped together\u201d in unhelpful ways.\n\u201cWe need to be able to have two different conversations about the economy,\u201d Mr. Davis argues \u2014 one about the overall size, steadiness and direction of \u201cthe ship,\u201d and another about its quality.\n\u201cWe need to be able to distinguish between the question of whether the ship is sinking,\u201d he said, \u201cand the question of whether the accommodations on the ship are adequate.\u201d",
