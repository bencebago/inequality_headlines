    "text": "A demonstrator holds a \"Tax The Rich\" sign during a protest near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, on Thursday, April 10, 2025. As the United States reaches its 250th year, the widening gulf between the very rich few and the rest of us has become glaringly apparent. In 2024, the richest 10% held over 67%  of household wealth in the U.S., while the bottom half held just 2.4%. This wealth increasingly entitles one to power and privilege: there are numerous billionaires in key positions in the Trump Administration, and some (including the President) have used their public offices for financial gain. The Founders would be horrified by these developments because they believed great wealth in politics would corrupt and destroy the republic. Those beliefs were shaped by a range of influences: the widely read works by Roman historians who blamed the empire’s decline on a widening gap between rich and poor; radical Protestants who called for a Godly republic with limits on property or even its redistribution in a Great Jubilee every 50 years; James Harrington’s 1656 novel Oceana, describing an island country with a constitution that gave land to all and placed explicit limits on income and wealth; Enlightenment philosophers, particularly John Locke’s Two Treatises of Government (1689), which argued “all Men by Nature are equal” and that individuals should not hoard surplus wealth; and Cato’s Letters, a series written by British “radical Whigs” in the 1720s who, angered by the infamous South Sea Bubble, called for reforms while bitterly criticizing the corrupting ties between wealth and politics. Advertisement By the mid-18th century, Anglo-Americans generally believed in the virtues of a “rough” economic equality, that a republic needed to avoid concentrated wealth and great poverty in order to maintain the public good and prevent corruption. These ideals held particular power because they reflected the experiences of most British Americans. Widespread property ownership among white settlers meant that in every province a far higher percentage of white adult men could vote than in England. Even the wealthiest Southern planters needed the political support of their poorer—yet still property-holding—neighbors. Read More: How Insecurity Became the New Inequality The widespread embrace of these ideas can be glimpsed in the publication of Cato’s Letters in the Boston Independent Advertiser in 1748. The very first selection included the warning that when a man’s wealth “become immeasurably or surprising great,” the community “ought to make strict Enquiry, how they came by them, and oblige them” to surrender part of their riches. “But, will some say, is it a Crime to be rich? Yes, certainly. At the publick expence, or to the Danger of the Publick.”  The Advertiser was edited by Samuel Adams for artisans and laborers fired up by their successful resistance to impressment—the Navy’s effort to grab men for forced service—and concerned about rising poverty in the postwar depression. Sixteen years later, Adams would organize those artisans and laborers into the Sons of Liberty to resist British imperial measures. Advertisement These egalitarian ideas became more apparent as the conflict with London deepened and moved towards revolution. In his 1773 election sermon, Benjamin Trumbull warned Connecticut’s governor and legislators that if a few were allowed to “amass all the riches and wealth of a country” they would “by fraud or force . . . oppress and tyrannize over their fellow-men.” To avoid that evil, the community needed to keep property “as equally divided as possible.” Three years later, such a measure nearly became part of Pennsylvania’s first constitution when a delegate, probably Benjamin Franklin, proposed empowering the legislature to take “excessive” property from individuals because concentrations of wealth were “a danger to the happiness of mankind.” As the War for Independence widened and inflation became a major problem, many states and towns sought to regulate prices, in part for egalitarian reasons. For example, in May 1777, committees of safety in Plymouth County began their resolution supporting Massachusetts price limits by insisting that “the felicity, freedom, and happiness of a community” depends on “an equitable exchange of the fruits of the earth.” Two years later, as inflation returned, a huge Philadelphia gathering denounced the wealthy and elected a committee to lower prices. When a merchant committee condemned those restraints, the committee insisted that civil society required “subordination to the common good” and argued that those who had built the merchants’ ships were entitled to regulate goods carried on the vessels. Advertisement As the war ended, many white Americans believed that they lived in the most egalitarian country on earth, where most free men could vote due to, as Noah Webster wrote, the “general and tolerably equal distribution of landed property.” But they also feared a future aristocracy of wealth, and thus considered measures to forestall that evil.  Some called for limits on landholding, including the biblical Great Jubilee that would prevent “land monopoly” by cancelling debts and returning land to the original owners. Thomas Jefferson and others talked about progressive property taxes. And Thomas Paine called for a 10% estate tax to fund old-age pensions and a payment to every person at 21.  These proposals failed but there was one noticeable change: by 1800, nearly every state abolished the traditional laws of entail (permanently blocking the division or alteration of property) and primogeniture (inheritance of the entire estate by the eldest son) in order to encourage the division of large estates. At least in Virginia, those reforms, spearheaded by Jefferson, did reduce the size of inherited farms. Advertisement Read More: The Rise of America’s Broligarchy and What to Do About It Unfortunately, this focus on land overlooked the growing role of financial wealth: as trade and manufacturing flourished, power was increasingly measured in dollars rather than acres. When wage labor and economic inequality increased in the early 1800s, states extended the vote to all white men regardless of property. This severed the connection between property and polity, relieving pressure to limit wealth while making the racial barrier explicit.  But America’s egalitarian tradition did not disappear. It would be revived by Workingmen’s parties in the late 1820s, communitarian efforts in the 1840s, calls in the mid-1860s to redistribute Confederate plantations to freed Black men, and labor and farmer movements into the 20th century. More persistent has been the widespread fear that great wealth poses an existential threat to America’s democracy. Perhaps the 250th commemoration of the Revolution would be the time to again consider limits on excessive wealth and its political influence.

    "text": "The top 10% of wealthy Americans now control 60% of the nation’s wealth, while the poorer half of the country holds only 6%, according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office.  Left-leaning think tanks produce regular updates on growing wealth inequality in America. This analysis, though, comes from a nonpartisan federal agency, one whose findings regularly inconvenience both Democrats and Republicans.  The new report, released this month, illustrates the role of Social Security in shoring up the wealth of middle-class and working-class Americans. If you subtract Social Security from the equation, the top 10% control nearly 70% of the nation’s wealth, and the bottom half holds only 3%.  “For 90% of households, Social Security is the most important thing in their portfolio,” said Monique Morrissey, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. “And any cuts to Social Security, therefore, would have a huge impact.”  The Social Security fund is projected to run short in about 10 years. Both leading presidential candidates have pledged to protect it.   Democrats in Congress accuse Republicans of seeking to cut Social Security benefits by raising the retirement age. Republicans counter that President Joe Biden has imperiled the program with reckless overspending.   Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Democrat, said he requested the budget office analysis to highlight wealth disparities, and to show how much Social Security matters to lower-income Americans. Whitehouse chairs the Senate Budget Committee.  \"As this CBO report shows, the top 1% of families now control more than four times the wealth of the entire bottom half,\" Whitehouse said in a statement to USA TODAY. Presidential candidate Kamala Harris proposes to protect Social Security “by making millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share in taxes,” according to campaign documents.   Democrats propose to reap new revenue by raising tax rates on the wealthiest Americans and corporations, and by going after wealthy tax cheats.   The Republican platform for 2024 includes a pledge to “fight for and protect Social Security and Medicare with no cuts, including no changes to the retirement age.” Candidate Donald Trump has reasoned that economic growth and job creation would naturally boost payroll tax revenue and support Social Security.   The new report finds that the overall wealth held by American households nearly quadrupled from 1989 to 2022, from $52 trillion to $199 trillion, after adjusting for inflation. The figures come from the federal Survey of Consumer Finances.   The budget office has calculated wealth disparities before, but the new report is the first to include projected Social Security benefits.   All told, Social Security accounts for about 20% of America’s wealth, the report found. But the benefits are much more important to lower-income households.   Social Security benefits account for roughly half of the wealth of Americans in the bottom 25%, the analysis found, but for only 8% of the wealth of the top 10%.  The report found wealth inequality on the rise, even when you factor in Social Security:  The analysis “is stating the obvious, that wealth in the United States is concentrated, and getting more so,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “This has been in the makings, really, for two generations, maybe three. And the trend lines are disconcerting.”  Yet, the budget office report also shows that the poorest Americans have grown wealthier along with the wealthiest.  In fact, family wealth increased most rapidly from 1989 to 2022 among some of the least affluent households.   Family wealth rose by 232% in those years for Americans at the 25th percentile, meaning that three-quarters of households were wealthier. In the same span, family wealth grew by 148% for households at the 90th percentile.  “The question, fundamentally, is, are living standards improving over time? And the answer is yes,” said Kyle Pomerleau, a senior fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.  The wealth analysis draws from the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finance, which found that household wealth in America swelled at a record pace during the pandemic. From 2019 to 2022, the median net worth of U.S. families grew 37% to $192,900, after inflation, the largest rise in the history of the survey. Wealth rose at all income levels.  “Widespread economic growth that is shared broadly in the population is a good thing,” said Owen Zidar, a Princeton University economist.  Most Americans believe there is too much economic inequality in America, according to a 2020 report from Pew Research. More than half of Americans also believe rich people and corporations don’t pay their fair share of taxes.   But the concentration of wealth is also the story of successful entrepreneurship in America, the rise of prosperous companies and innovative products, Pomerleau said, “and that’s something that we should foster in the United States.” Whitehouse, the senator who requested the report, is using the findings to argue for higher tax rates on the wealthiest Americans, echoing the Harris platform.   In 2017, then-President Trump signed legislation that lowered taxes across all income groups, with wealthier taxpayers benefiting the most, according to the nonprofit PolitiFact. Those cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025.  \"Our corrupted tax code has helped enable a few ultra-rich individuals to capture for themselves more than a quarter of our nation’s wealth, undermining the American middle class and hollowing out local communities,\" Whitehouse said. Trump has said he will extend the cuts if voters reelect him. Harris has pledged to extend most of the cuts but to raise tax rates on the very wealthiest Americans and on wealthy corporations.   Some economists have urged both parties to consider even steeper taxes. In one recent analysis, researchers found that the government could raise $1.8 trillion over a decade by restoring the higher tax rates of 1997.  “It would raise trillions and bring the tax code back to an era of fiscal responsibility and strong economic growth,” said Zidar, who joined in the research.  Pomerleau, at the American Enterprise Institute, concurs that taxing the wealthy could raise money and shore up Social Security – to a point.  “There’s only so much money you can get from high-income households,” he said. ",

    "title": "Extreme inequality was the preexisting condition': How COVID-19 widened America's wealth gap",
    "domain": "abcnews.go.com",
    "text": "As 45 million Americans lost their jobs, U.S. billionaires made $584 billion. The novel coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated income inequality, experts say, stretching the racial wealth gap in the United States and making the richest wealthier while leaving many of the poorest without jobs. As the COVID-19 pandemic overtook the U.S., it brought with it an unprecedented financial crisis and unemployment rates at their highest levels since the Great Depression, especially among Black, Hispanic and Asian workers (16.8%, 17.6% and 15% in May compared to 12.4% for whites). At least 45 million people have filed for unemployment since the pandemic began. Yet between March 18 and June 17, as the pandemic raged, the combined wealth of the 614 U.S. billionaires increased by $584 billion, according to an analysis released late last week by the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank based in Washington, D.C. The researchers calculated the billionaires' wealth gains based on real-time data from Forbes. Experts said the wealth of the richest Americans is tied more closely than the rest of America to the stock market, which crashed at the onset of the crisis but has rallied since -- largely detached from the broader economic picture. \"The pandemic crisis will widen the already worrisome levels of income, racial, and gender inequality in the U.S,\" Dimitri Papadimitriou, President of the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College, and former Greek Minister of Economy and Development, told ABC News. \"This engenders an element of a vicious circle at work: not only will the pandemic and its fallout worsen inequality; inequality will exacerbate the spread of the virus, not to mention undermine any ensuing economic recovery efforts.\" Data has shown that the virus has disproportionately affected Blacks and Latinos, who each have hospitalization rates 4.5 times that of non-Hispanic whites, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Communities of color are also overrepresented among essential workers who are generally unable to work from home and more likely to come into contact with the virus. \"Even though most people would assert that a disease or other disaster is blind to differences of race, creed or wealth, we are not ‘all in this pandemic together,'\" Papadimitrou added. \"This assumption that 'we are together' distracts us from the socio-economic dimensions of the COVID-19 crisis.\" Chuck Collins, the co-author of the analysis and the director of the program on inequality at the Institute for Policy Studies told ABC News that their findings are \"a reflection of this extremely unequal time that we are living in and it's not that simple, it's really 40 years of accumulating, accelerating inequality.\" As the U.S. entered the pandemic, \"in some ways the extreme inequality was the preexisting condition,\" Collins said. The impact of income inequality during a pandemic isn’t just linked to economic hardship -- it can also be deadly. A team of researchers from the London School of Economics U.S. Centre argued in a May analysis that \"states with greater income inequality are more likely to report more COVID-19 cases and fatalities.\" \"The effect of inequality is large -- it is tied with the Human Development Index as the second strongest predictor of Covid deaths in various states,” Harold Clarke, a professor of economics at University of Texas at Dallas and Paul Whitely, a professor at the University of Essex, wrote in their findings. The researchers measured inequality using the Gini Index, an economic barometer that ranks income inequality from 0 (total inequality) to 1 (total equality) and found that it was a strong predictor of COVID-19 deaths. New York, which had one of the highest Gini Index numbers at .52 also had the highest number of fatalities in the nation by a margin. But excluding New York and New Jersey, the researchers found that inequality was still a strong predictor. \"The U.S. so far has had the most deaths of any country,\" Dr. Mary Bassett, the director of the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at the Harvard T.H. Chan School, told ABC News. \"In the U.S., these track along racial lines, and you'll hear the phrase racial capitalism now being raised by protesters that the kind of economy that the United States developed was not only a capitalist economy but one that was kick-started by its reliance on slave labor.\" \"We see that reflected in the present day,” Bassett said. \"To be black or Latino or Native American in the United States is to have a much higher risk of being poor.\" A Brookings Institute analysis found that in 2016, the typical white family had a net worth 10 times that of a Black family ($171,000 compared to $17,150). \"People’s income determines their everyday lives, which includes their ability to access health services -- that's always true, but COVID-19 broke down into stark relief,\" Bassett said. \"I would argue that a series of choices that have been made in the United States at the societal level meant that the U.S. was much more vulnerable to this pandemic.\" Papadimitriou added that \"a reduction in income inequality is one of the most important -- if not the single-most important -- structural changes that needs to be implemented so that the U.S. economy can return to a sustainable growth path in the medium run.\" A public policy brief written by several of Papadimitriou's colleagues at the Levy Economics Institute, concludes that \"had these issues been addressed already, the pandemic’s impacts on the United States would have been less severe.\" Michael Graetz, a professor at Columbia University and the author of the book \"The Wolf at the Door: The Menace of Economic Insecurity and How to Fight It,\" said some of the richest have seen their wealth grow during the pandemic in part because of how divorced the stock market can be from the real economy. \"Some stocks, the tech stocks in particular, have done extremely well during the pandemic and of course lots of shares of Facebook and Amazon and others are owned by billionaires so of course their wealth has gone up because their stock has gone up in value,\" he said. \"The bottom half of the American public doesn’t own stocks so they haven’t shared in those gains.\" The bottom 40% of earners, he added, have been hurt most by unemployment during the pandemic. \"So you have a situation where they’ve lost their wages and Congress has temporarily provided some extra unemployment benefits to some of those folks and then sent $1,200 dollar checks but for those people, the people at the bottom half of the income distribution, have been living a precarious life before the pandemic, Graetz said. Congress boosted unemployment benefits during the pandemic and opened relief up to freelancers and others generally not covered by unemployment insurance. But people had to wait weeks in some cases for benefits. Stimulus checks were also not issued on a sliding scale based on need (although married couples making over $198,000 were ineligible). Even before the pandemic, Graetz cited a 2018 Federal Reserve survey that found nearly 40% of American families said they couldn't cover an unexpected $400 expense. \"The pandemic has created emergencies that are much larger than $400,\" he said. Wealth inequality in the U.S. is intrinsically linked to the racial wealth gap, Valerie Wilson, the director of the program on race, ethnicity, and the economy at the Economic Policy Institute, told ABC News. \"If we’re seeing growth wealth inequality in general then it almost goes without question to say that the racial wealth gap is widening as well because a lot of the underlying racial disparities throughout the economy in wages, employment, income,” Wilson said. \"Part of getting to recovery has to do with addressing these holes that have been opened even more by the pandemic.\" Understanding the rampant inequalities that are being exacerbated during the crisis are crucial when policymakers look towards economic recovery efforts. \"The first thing is just how to make sure the current recovery programs and stimulus programs reduce the racial wealth divide, not make it worse,\" Collins told ABC News. One solution is the Democrat-backed HEROES Act, Collins said, which provides hazard pay to front-line workers among other relief as well as oversight of current funding. \"We’re spending trillions of dollars, let's not make the same mistakes that we did after the great recession of 2009 where we put in place policies that worsened the racial wealth gap,\" he added. \"It requires a certain intentional commitment to racial equity as part of the recovery.\" Bassett noted that \"$2 trillion [in the CARES Act] was mobilized to save Wall Street and large corporations\" which proves \"the U.S. can mobilize that kind of level of resource to protect people.\" \"But that would take a great deal of political courage and votes that currently don't exist,\" she added. Collins said data collection amid the pandemic is crucial, as are audits of how stimulus and government relief funds are being used. Finally, Collins noted the ultra-rich need to be paying their fair share of taxes. \"One of the reasons why our economy is so ill prepared, our public health system and our ability to respond to the pandemic, is because the very rich have seen their share of taxes continue to go down over the last three four decades, so we have to restore some progressivity to the tax code,\" he said. Papadimitrou said that policies combatting the epidemic and financial crisis must \"be sensitive to inequalities and to avoid exacerbating biases that increase social, gender, and racial gaps.\" \"If we ignore the regressive impact or refrain from taking action to mitigate these unequal harms will not only be an affront to principles of fairness, it will prolong the pandemic and worsen its severity,” he added. While people can feel powerless, Wilson noted there are many ways you can make your voice heard. \"Why I feel people still have a voice is because of the protests, those are connected to police brutality and violence against Black people,\" she said, but noted that many companies and even government agencies have responded to them. \"We’re tired of this, we want this to change, I think the same kind of attitude can be applied to so many kinds of injustices in this country.\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

As the COVID-19 pandemic overtook the U.S., it brought with it an unprecedented financial crisis and unemployment rates at their highest levels since the Great Depression, especially among Black, Hispanic and Asian workers (16.8%, 17.6% and 15% in May compared to 12.4% for whites). At least 45 million people have filed for unemployment since the pandemic began. Yet between March 18 and June 17, as the pandemic raged, the combined wealth of the 614 U.S. billionaires increased by $584 billion, according to an analysis released late last week by the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank based in Washington, D.C. The researchers calculated the billionaires' wealth gains based on real-time data from Forbes.\n\nExperts said the wealth of the richest Americans is tied more closely than the rest of America to the stock market, which crashed at the onset of the crisis but has rallied since -- largely detached from the broader economic picture. \"The pandemic crisis will widen the already worrisome levels of income, racial, and gender inequality in the U.S,\" Dimitri Papadimitriou, President of the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College, and former Greek Minister of Economy and Development, told ABC News. \"This engenders an element of a vicious circle at work: not only will the pandemic and its fallout worsen inequality; inequality will exacerbate the spread of the virus, not to mention undermine any ensuing economic recovery efforts.\"\n\nData has shown that the virus has disproportionately affected Blacks and Latinos, who each have hospitalization rates 4.5 times that of non-Hispanic whites, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Communities of color are also overrepresented among essential workers who are generally unable to work from home and more likely to come into contact with the virus. \"Even though most people would assert that a disease or other disaster is blind to differences of race, creed or wealth, we are not ‘all in this pandemic together,'\" Papadimitrou added. \"This assumption that 'we are together' distracts us from the socio-economic dimensions of the COVID-19 crisis.\"\n\nChuck Collins, the co-author of the analysis and the director of the program on inequality at the Institute for Policy Studies told ABC News that their findings are \"a reflection of this extremely unequal time that we are living in and it's not that simple, it's really 40 years of accumulating, accelerating inequality.\" As the U.S. entered the pandemic, \"in some ways the extreme inequality was the preexisting condition,\" Collins said.\n\nThe impact of income inequality during a pandemic isn’t just linked to economic hardship -- it can also be deadly. A team of researchers from the London School of Economics U.S. Centre argued in a May analysis that \"states with greater income inequality are more likely to report more COVID-19 cases and fatalities.\" \"The effect of inequality is large -- it is tied with the Human Development Index as the second strongest predictor of Covid deaths in various states,” Harold Clarke, a professor of economics at University of Texas at Dallas and Paul Whitely, a professor at the University of Essex, wrote in their findings.\n\nThe researchers measured inequality using the Gini Index, an economic barometer that ranks income inequality from 0 (total inequality) to 1 (total equality) and found that it was a strong predictor of COVID-19 deaths. New York, which had one of the highest Gini Index numbers at .52 also had the highest number of fatalities in the nation by a margin. But excluding New York and New Jersey, the researchers found that inequality was still a strong predictor.\n\n\"The U.S. so far has had the most deaths of any country,\" Dr. Mary Bassett, the director of the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at the Harvard T.H.

    "text": "November 1, 2019 13 min read Is Inequality Inevitable? Wealth naturally trickles up in free-market economies, model suggests By Bruce M. Boghosian  Hanna Barczyk Wealth inequality is escalating at an alarming rate not only within the U.S. but also in countries as diverse as Russia, India and Brazil. According to investment bank Credit Suisse, the fraction of global household wealth held by the richest 1 percent of the world's population increased from 42.5 to 47.2 percent between the financial crisis of 2008 and 2018. To put it another way, as of 2010, 388 individuals possessed as much household wealth as the lower half of the world's population combined—about 3.5 billion people; today Oxfam estimates that number as 26. Statistics from almost all nations that measure wealth in their household surveys indicate that it is becoming increasingly concentrated. Although the origins of inequality are hotly debated, an approach developed by physicists and mathematicians, including my group at Tufts University, suggests they have long been hiding in plain sight—in a well-known quirk of arithmetic. This method uses models of wealth distribution collectively known as agent-based, which begin with an individual transaction between two “agents” or actors, each trying to optimize his or her own financial outcome. In the modern world, nothing could seem more fair or natural than two people deciding to exchange goods, agreeing on a price and shaking hands. Indeed, the seeming stability of an economic system arising from this balance of supply and demand among individual actors is regarded as a pinnacle of Enlightenment thinking—to the extent that many people have come to conflate the free market with the notion of freedom itself. Our deceptively simple mathematical models, which are based on voluntary transactions, suggest, however, that it is time for a serious reexamination of this idea. In particular, the affine wealth model (called thus because of its mathematical properties) can describe wealth distribution among households in diverse developed countries with exquisite precision while revealing a subtle asymmetry that tends to concentrate wealth. We believe that this purely analytical approach, which resembles an x-ray in that it is used not so much to represent the messiness of the real world as to strip it away and reveal the underlying skeleton, provides deep insight into the forces acting to increase poverty and inequality today.

In 1986 social scientist John Angle first described the movement and distribution of wealth as arising from pairwise transactions among a collection of “economic agents,” which could be individuals, households, companies, funds or other entities. By the turn of the century physicists Slava Ispolatov, Pavel L. Krapivsky and Sidney Redner, then all working together at Boston University, as well as Adrian Drăgulescu, now at Constellation Energy Group, and Victor Yakovenko of the University of Maryland, had demonstrated that these agent-based models could be analyzed with the tools of statistical physics, leading to rapid advances in our understanding of their behavior. As it turns out, many such models find wealth moving inexorably from one agent to another—even if they are based on fair exchanges between equal actors. In 2002 Anirban Chakraborti, then at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kolkata, India, introduced what came to be known as the yard sale model, called thus because it has certain features of real one-on-one economic transactions. He also used numerical simulations to demonstrate that it inexorably concentrated wealth, resulting in oligarchy. Credit: Brown Bird Design To understand how this happens, suppose you are in a casino and are invited to play a game. You must place some ante—say, $100—on a table, and a fair coin will be flipped. If the coin comes up heads, the house will pay you 20 percent of what you have on the table, resulting in $120 on the table. If the coin comes up tails, the house will take 17 percent of what you have on the table, resulting in $83 left on the table. You can keep your money on the table for as many flips of the coin as you would like (without ever adding to or subtracting from it). Each time you play, you will win 20 percent of what is on the table if the coin comes up heads, and you will lose 17 percent of it if the coin comes up tails. Should you agree to play this game? You might construct two arguments, both rather persuasive, to help you decide what to do. You may think, “I have a probability of ½ of gaining $20 and a probability of ½ of losing $17. My expected gain is therefore: ½ x ($20) + ½ x (-$17) = $1.50 which is positive. In other words, my odds of winning and losing are even, but my gain if I win will be greater than my loss if I lose.” From this perspective it seems advantageous to play this game. Or, like a chess player, you might think further: “What if I stay for 10 flips of the coin? A likely outcome is that five of them will come up heads and that the other five will come up tails. Each time heads comes up, my ante is multiplied by 1.2. Each time tails comes up, my ante is multiplied by 0.83. After five wins and five losses in any order, the amount of money remaining on the table will be: 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.83 x 0.83 x 0.83 x 0.83 x 0.83 x $100 = $98.02 so I will have lost about $2 of my original $100 ante.” With a bit more work you can confirm that it would take about 93 wins to compensate for 91 losses. From this perspective it seems disadvantageous to play this game. The contradiction between the two arguments presented here may seem surprising at first, but it is well known in probability and finance. Its connection with wealth inequality is less familiar, however. To extend the casino metaphor to the movement of wealth in an (exceedingly simplified) economy, let us imagine a system of 1,000 individuals who engage in pairwise exchanges with one another. Let each begin with some initial wealth, which could be exactly equal. Choose two agents at random and have them transact, then do the same with another two, and so on. In other words, this model assumes sequential transactions between randomly chosen pairs of agents. Our plan is to conduct millions or billions of such transactions in our population of 1,000 and see how the wealth ultimately gets distributed. Credit: Hanna Barczyk What should a single transaction between a pair of agents look like? People have a natural aversion to going broke, so we assume that the amount at stake, which we call Δω (Δω is pronounced “delta w”), is a mere fraction of the wealth of the poorer person, Shauna. That way, even if Shauna loses in a transaction with Eric, the richer person, the amount she loses is always less than her own total wealth. This is not an unreasonable assumption and in fact captures a self-imposed limitation that most people instinctively observe in their economic life. To begin with—just because these numbers are familiar to us—let us suppose Δω is 20 percent of Shauna's wealth, ω, if she wins and –17 percent of ω if she loses. (Our actual model assumes that the win and loss percentages are equal, but the general outcome still holds. Moreover, increasing or decreasing Δω will just extend the time scale so that more transactions will be required before we can see the ultimate result, which will remain unaltered.) If our goal is to model a fair and stable market economy, we ought to begin by assuming that nobody has an advantage of any kind, so let us decide the direction in which w is moved by the flip of a fair coin. If the coin comes up heads, Shauna gets 20 percent of her wealth from Eric; if the coin comes up tails, she must give 17 percent of it to Eric. Now randomly choose another pair of agents from the total of 1,000 and do it again. In fact, go ahead and do this a million times or a billion times. What happens? If you simulate this economy, a variant of the yard sale model, you will get a remarkable result: after a large number of transactions, one agent ends up as an “oligarch” holding practically all the wealth of the economy, and the other 999 end up with virtually nothing. It does not matter how much wealth people started with. It does not matter that all the coin flips were absolutely fair. It does not matter that the poorer agent's expected outcome was positive in each transaction, whereas that of the richer agent was negative. Any single agent in this economy could have become the oligarch—in fact, all had equal odds if they began with equal wealth. In that sense, there was equality of opportunity. But only one of them did become the oligarch, and all the others saw their average wealth decrease toward zero as they conducted more and more transactions. To add insult to injury, the lower someone's wealth ranking, the faster the decrease. This outcome is especially surprising because it holds even if all the agents started off with identical wealth and were treated symmetrically. Physicists describe phenomena of this kind as “symmetry breaking” [see The Physics of Inequality below]. The very first coin flip transfers money from one agent to another, setting up an imbalance between the two. And once we have some variance in wealth, however minute, succeeding transactions will systematically move a “trickle” of wealth upward from poorer agents to richer ones, amplifying inequality until the system reaches a state of oligarchy. If the economy is unequal to begin with, the poorest agent's wealth will probably decrease the fastest. Where does it go? It must go to wealthier agents because there are no poorer agents. Things are not much better for the second-poorest agent. In the long run, all participants in this economy except for the very richest one will see their wealth decay exponentially. In separate papers in 2015 my colleagues and I at Tufts University and Christophe Chorro of Université Panthéon-Sorbonne provided mathematical proofs of the outcome that Chakraborti's simulations had uncovered—that the yard sale model moves wealth inexorably from one side to the other. Does this mean that poorer agents never win or that richer agents never lose? Certainly not. Once again, the setup resembles a casino—you win some and you lose some, but the longer you stay in the casino, the more likely you are to lose. The free market is essentially a casino that you can never leave. When the trickle of wealth described earlier, flowing from poor to rich in each transaction, is multiplied by 7.7 billion people in the world conducting countless transactions every year, the trickle becomes a torrent. Inequality inevitably grows more pronounced because of the collective effects of enormous numbers of seemingly innocuous but subtly biased transactions. You might, of course, wonder how this model, even if mathematically accurate, has anything to do with reality. After all, it describes an entirely unstable economy that inevitably degenerates to complete oligarchy, and there are no complete oligarchies in the world. It is true that, by itself, the yard sale model is unable to explain empirical wealth distributions. To address this deficiency, my group has refined it in three ways to make it more realistic. In 2017 Adrian Devitt-Lee, Merek Johnson, Jie Li, Jeremy Marcq, Hongyan Wang and I, all at Tufts, incorporated the redistribution of wealth. In keeping with the simplicity desirable in applied mathematics models, we did this by having each agent take a step toward the mean wealth in the society after each transaction. The size of the step was some fraction χ (or “chi”) of his or her distance from the mean. This is equivalent to a flat wealth tax for the wealthy (with tax rate χ per unit time) and a complementary subsidy for the poor. In effect, it transfers wealth from those above the mean to those below it. We found that this simple modification stabilized the wealth distribution so that oligarchy no longer resulted. And astonishingly, it enabled our model to match empirical data on U.S. and European wealth distribution between 1989 and 2016 to better than 2 percent. The single parameter χ seems to subsume a host of real-world taxes and subsidies that would be too messy to include separately in a skeletal model such as this one. Credit: Jen Christiansen In addition, it is well documented that the wealthy enjoy systemic economic advantages such as lower interest rates on loans and better financial advice, whereas the poor suffer systemic economic disadvantages such as payday lenders and a lack of time to shop for the best prices. As James Baldwin once observed, “Anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor.” Accordingly, in the same paper mentioned above, we factored in what we call wealth-attained advantage. We biased the coin flip in favor of the wealthier individual by an amount proportional to a new parameter, ζ (or “zeta”), times the wealth difference divided by the mean wealth. This rather simple refinement, which serves as a proxy for a multitude of biases favoring the wealthy, improved agreement between the model and the upper tail of actual wealth distributions. The inclusion of wealth-related bias also yields—and gives a precise mathematical definition to—the phenomenon of partial oligarchy. Whenever the influence of wealth-attained advantage exceeds that of redistribution (more precisely, whenever ζ exceeds χ), a vanishingly small fraction of people will possess a finite fraction, 1 − χ/ζ, of societal wealth. The onset of partial oligarchy is in fact a phase transition for another model of economic transactions, as first described in 2000 by physicists Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, now at École Polytechnique, and Marc Mézard of the École Normale Supérieure. In our model, when ζ is less than χ, the system has only one stable state with no oligarchy; when ζ exceeds χ, a new, oligarchical state appears and becomes the stable state [see graphic above]. The two-parameter (χ and ζ) extended yard sale model thus obtained can match empirical data on U.S. and European wealth distribution between 1989 and 2016 to within 1 to 2 percent. Such a phase transition may have played a crucial role in the condensation of wealth following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The imposition of what was called shock therapy economics on the former states of the U.S.S.R. resulted in a dramatic decrease of wealth redistribution (that is, decreasing χ) by their governments and a concomitant jump in wealth-attained advantage (increasing ζ) from the combined effects of sudden privatization and deregulation. The resulting decrease of the “temperature” χ/ζ threw the countries into a wealth-condensed state, so that formerly communist countries became partial oligarchies almost overnight. To the present day at least 10 of the 15 former Soviet republics can be accurately described as oligarchies. As a third refinement, in 2019 we included negative wealth—one of the more disturbing aspects of modern economies—in our model. In 2016, for example, approximately 10.5 percent of the U.S. population was in net debt because of mortgages, student loans and other factors. So we introduced a third parameter, κ (or “kappa”), which shifts the wealth distribution downward, thereby accounting for negative wealth. We supposed that the least wealth the poorest agent could have at any time was –S, where S equals κ times the mean wealth. Prior to each transaction, we loaned wealth S to both agents so that each had positive wealth. They then transacted according to the extended yard sale model, described earlier, after which they both repaid their debt of S. The three-parameter (χ, ζ, κ) model thus obtained, called the affine wealth model, can match empirical data on U.S. wealth distribution to less than a sixth of a percent over a span of three decades. (In mathematics, the word “affine” describes something that scales multiplicatively and translates additively. In this case, some features of the model, such as the value of Δω, scale multiplicatively with the wealth of the agent, whereas other features, such as the addition or subtraction of S, are additive translations or displacements in “wealth space.”) Agreement with European wealth-distribution data for 2010 is typically better than a third to a half of a percent [see box below]. To obtain these comparisons with actual data, we had to solve the “inverse problem.” That is, given the empirical wealth distribution, we had to find the values of (χ, ζ, κ) at which the results of our model most closely matched it. As just one example, the 2016 U.S. household wealth distribution is best described as having χ = 0.036, ζ = 0.050 and κ = 0.058. The affine wealth model has been applied to empirical data from many countries and epochs. To the best of our knowledge, it describes wealth-distribution data more accurately than any other existing model. Credit: Jen Christiansen; Source: Bruce M. Boghosian; European Central Bank (country data) We find it noteworthy that the best-fitting model for empirical wealth distribution discovered so far is one that would be completely unstable without redistribution rather than one based on a supposed equilibrium of market forces. In fact, these mathematical models demonstrate that far from wealth trickling down to the poor, the natural inclination of wealth is to flow upward, so that the “natural” wealth distribution in a free-market economy is one of complete oligarchy. It is only redistribution that sets limits on inequality. The mathematical models also call attention to the enormous extent to which wealth distribution is caused by symmetry breaking, chance and early advantage (from, for example, inheritance). And the presence of symmetry breaking puts paid to arguments for the justness of wealth inequality that appeal to “voluntariness”—the notion that individuals bear all responsibility for their economic outcomes simply because they enter into transactions voluntarily—or to the idea that wealth accumulation must be the result of cleverness and industriousness. It is true that an individual's location on the wealth spectrum correlates to some extent with such attributes, but the overall shape of that spectrum can be explained to better than 0.33 percent by a statistical model that completely ignores them. Luck plays a much more important role than it is usually accorded, so that the virtue commonly attributed to wealth in modern society—and, likewise, the stigma attributed to poverty—is completely unjustified. Moreover, only a carefully designed mechanism for redistribution can compensate for the natural tendency of wealth to flow from the poor to the rich in a market economy. Redistribution is often confused with taxes, but the two concepts ought to be kept quite separate. Taxes flow from people to their governments to finance those governments' activities. Redistribution, in contrast, may be implemented by governments, but it is best thought of as a flow of wealth from people to people to compensate for the unfairness inherent in market economics. In a flat redistribution scheme, all those possessing wealth below the mean would receive net funds, whereas those above the mean would pay. And precisely because current levels of inequality are so extreme, far more people would receive than would pay. Given how complicated real economies are, we find it gratifying that a simple analytical approach developed by physicists and mathematicians describes the actual wealth distributions of multiple nations with unprecedented precision and accuracy. Also rather curious is that these distributions display subtle but key features of complex physical systems. Most important, however, the fact that a sketch of the free market as simple and plausible as the affine wealth model gives rise to economies that are anything but free and fair should be both a cause for alarm and a call for action.

    "onlytext": "Wealth inequality is escalating at an alarming rate not only within the U.S. but also in countries as diverse as Russia, India and Brazil. According to investment bank Credit Suisse, the fraction of global household wealth held by the richest 1 percent of the world's population increased from 42.5 to 47.2 percent between the financial crisis of 2008 and 2018. To put it another way, as of 2010, 388 individuals possessed as much household wealth as the lower half of the world's population combined—about 3.5 billion people; today Oxfam estimates that number as 26. Statistics from almost all nations that measure wealth in their household surveys indicate that it is becoming increasingly concentrated.\n\nAlthough the origins of inequality are hotly debated, an approach developed by physicists and mathematicians, including my group at Tufts University, suggests they have long been hiding in plain sight—in a well-known quirk of arithmetic. This method uses models of wealth distribution collectively known as agent-based, which begin with an individual transaction between two “agents” or actors, each trying to optimize his or her own financial outcome.\n\nIn the modern world, nothing could seem more fair or natural than two people deciding to exchange goods, agreeing on a price and shaking hands. Indeed, the seeming stability of an economic system arising from this balance of supply and demand among individual actors is regarded as a pinnacle of Enlightenment thinking—to the extent that many people have come to conflate the free market with the notion of freedom itself.\n\nOur deceptively simple mathematical models, which are based on voluntary transactions, suggest, however, that it is time for a serious reexamination of this idea. In particular, the affine wealth model (called thus because of its mathematical properties) can describe wealth distribution among households in diverse developed countries with exquisite precision while revealing a subtle asymmetry that tends to concentrate wealth.\n\nWe believe that this purely analytical approach, which resembles an x-ray in that it is used not so much to represent the messiness of the real world as to strip it away and reveal the underlying skeleton, provides deep insight into the forces acting to increase poverty and inequality today.\n\nIn 1986 social scientist John Angle first described the movement and distribution of wealth as arising from pairwise transactions among a collection of “economic agents,” which could be individuals, households, companies, funds or other entities. By the turn of the century physicists Slava Ispolatov, Pavel L. Krapivsky and Sidney Redner, then all working together at Boston University, as well as Adrian Drăgulescu, now at Constellation Energy Group, and Victor Yakovenko of the University of Maryland, had demonstrated that these agent-based models could be analyzed with the tools of statistical physics, leading to rapid advances in our understanding of their behavior.\n\nAs it turns out, many such models find wealth moving inexorably from one agent to another—even if they are based on fair exchanges between equal actors. In 2002 Anirban Chakraborti, then at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kolkata, India, introduced what came to be known as the yard sale model, called thus because it has certain features of real one-on-one economic transactions. He also used numerical simulations to demonstrate that it inexorably concentrated wealth, resulting in oligarchy.\n\nTo understand how this happens, suppose you are in a casino and are invited to play a game. You must place some ante—say, $100—on a table, and a fair coin will be flipped. If the coin comes up heads, the house will pay you 20 percent of what you have on the table, resulting in $120 on the table. If the coin comes up tails, the house will take 17 percent of what you have on the table, resulting in $83 left on the table. You can keep your money on the table for as many flips of the coin as you would like (without ever adding to or subtracting from it). Each time you play, you will win 20 percent of what is on the table if the coin comes up heads, and you will lose 17 percent of it if the coin comes up tails.\n\nShould you agree to play this game? You might construct two arguments, both rather persuasive, to help you decide what to do. You may think, “I have a probability of ½ of gaining $20 and a probability of ½ of losing $17. My expected gain is therefore: ½ x ($20) + ½ x (-$17) = $1.50 which is positive. In other words, my odds of winning and losing are even, but my gain if I win will be greater than my loss if I lose.” From this perspective it seems advantageous to play this game.\n\nOr, like a chess player, you might think further: “What if I stay for 10 flips of the coin? A likely outcome is that five of them will come up heads and that the other five will come up tails. Each time heads comes up, my ante is multiplied by 1.2. Each time tails comes up, my ante is multiplied by 0.83. After five wins and five losses in any order, the amount of money remaining on the table will be: 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.83 x 0.83 x 0.83 x 0.83 x 0.83 x $100 = $98.02 so I will have lost about $2 of my original $100 ante.” With a bit more work you can confirm that it would take about 93 wins to compensate for 91 losses. From this perspective it seems disadvantageous to play this game.\n\nThe contradiction between the two arguments presented here may seem surprising at first, but it is well known in probability and finance. Its connection with wealth inequality is less familiar, however.\n\nTo extend the casino metaphor to the movement of wealth in an (exceedingly simplified) economy, let us imagine a system of 1,000 individuals who engage in pairwise exchanges with one another. Let each begin with some initial wealth, which could be exactly equal. Choose two agents at random and have them transact, then do the same with another two, and so on. In other words, this model assumes sequential transactions between randomly chosen pairs of agents.\n\nOur plan is to conduct millions or billions of such transactions in our population of 1,000 and see how the wealth ultimately gets distributed.\n\nWhat should a single transaction between a pair of agents look like? People have a natural aversion to going broke, so we assume that the amount at stake, which we call Δω (Δω is pronounced “delta w”), is a mere fraction of the wealth of the poorer person, Shauna. That way, even if Shauna loses in a transaction with Eric, the richer person, the amount she loses is always less than her own total wealth.\n\nThis is not an unreasonable assumption and in fact captures a self-imposed limitation that most people instinctively observe in their economic life. To begin with—just because these numbers are familiar to us—let us suppose Δω is 20 percent of Shauna's wealth, ω, if she wins and –17 percent of ω if she loses.\n\nIf our goal is to model a fair and stable market economy, we ought to begin by assuming that nobody has an advantage of any kind, so let us decide the direction in which w is moved by the flip of a fair coin. If the coin comes up heads, Shauna gets 20 percent of her wealth from Eric; if the coin comes up tails, she must give 17 percent of it to Eric.\n\nNow randomly choose another pair of agents from the total of 1,000 and do it again. In fact, go ahead and do this a million times or a billion times. What happens?\n\nIf you simulate this economy, a variant of the yard sale model, you will get a remarkable result: after a large number of transactions, one agent ends up as an “oligarch” holding practically all the wealth of the economy, and the other 999 end up with virtually nothing.\n\nIt does not matter how much wealth people started with. It does not matter that all the coin flips were absolutely fair. It does not matter that the poorer agent's expected outcome was positive in each transaction, whereas that of the richer agent was negative. Any single agent in this economy could have become the oligarch—in fact, all had equal odds if they began with equal wealth.\n\nIn that sense, there was equality of opportunity. But only one of them did become the oligarch, and all the others saw their average wealth decrease toward zero as they conducted more and more transactions. To add insult to injury, the lower someone's wealth ranking, the faster the decrease.\n\nThis outcome is especially surprising because it holds even if all the agents started off with identical wealth and were treated symmetrically. Physicists describe phenomena of this kind as “symmetry breaking” [see The Physics of Inequality below]. The very first coin flip transfers money from one agent to another, setting up an imbalance between the two.\n\nAnd once we have some variance in wealth, however minute, succeeding transactions will systematically move a “trickle” of wealth upward from poorer agents to richer ones, amplifying inequality until the system reaches a state of oligarchy.\n\nIf the economy is unequal to begin with, the poorest agent's wealth will probably decrease the fastest. Where does it go? It must go to wealthier agents because there are no poorer agents.\n\nThings are not much better for the second-poorest agent. In the long run, all participants in this economy except for the very richest one will see their wealth decay exponentially.\n\nIn separate papers in 2015 my colleagues and I at Tufts University and Christophe Chorro of Université Panthéon-Sorbonne provided mathematical proofs of the outcome that Chakraborti's simulations had uncovered—that the yard sale model moves wealth inexorably from one side to the other.\n\nDoes this mean that poorer agents never win or that richer agents never lose? Certainly not. Once again, the setup resembles a casino—you win some and you lose some, but the longer you stay in the casino, the more likely you are to lose.\n\nThe free market is essentially a casino that you can never leave. When the trickle of wealth described earlier, flowing from poor to rich in each transaction, is multiplied by 7.7 billion people in the world conducting countless transactions every year, the trickle becomes a torrent.\n\nInequality inevitably grows more pronounced because of the collective effects of enormous numbers of seemingly innocuous but subtly biased transactions.\n\nYou might, of course, wonder how this model, even if mathematically accurate, has anything to do with reality. After all, it describes an entirely unstable economy that inevitably degenerates to complete oligarchy, and there are no complete oligarchies in the world.\n\nIt is true that, by itself, the yard sale model is unable to explain empirical wealth distributions. To address this deficiency, my group has refined it in three ways to make it more realistic.\n\nIn 2017 Adrian Devitt-Lee, Merek Johnson, Jie Li, Jeremy Marcq, Hongyan Wang and I, all at Tufts, incorporated the redistribution of wealth. In keeping with the simplicity desirable in applied mathematics models, we did this by having each agent take a step toward the mean wealth in the society after each transaction.\n\nThe size of the step was some fraction χ (or “chi”) of his or her distance from the mean. This is equivalent to a flat wealth tax for the wealthy (with tax rate χ per unit time) and a complementary subsidy for the poor.\n\nIn effect, it transfers wealth from those above the mean to those below it. We found that this simple modification stabilized the wealth distribution so that oligarchy no longer resulted.\n\nAnd astonishingly, it enabled our model to match empirical data on U.S. and European wealth distribution between 1989 and 2016 to better than 2 percent.\n\nThe single parameter χ seems to subsume a host of real-world taxes and subsidies that would be too messy to include separately in a skeletal model such as this one.\n\nIn addition, it is well documented that the wealthy enjoy systemic economic advantages such as lower interest rates on loans and better financial advice, whereas the poor suffer systemic economic disadvantages such as payday lenders and a lack of time to shop for the best prices.\n\nAs James Baldwin once observed, “Anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor.”\n\nAccordingly, in the same paper mentioned above, we factored in what we call wealth-attained advantage. We biased the coin flip in favor of the wealthier individual by an amount proportional to a new parameter, ζ (or “zeta”), times the wealth difference divided by the mean wealth.\n\nThis rather simple refinement, which serves as a proxy for a multitude of biases favoring the wealthy, improved agreement between the model and the upper tail of actual wealth distributions.\n\nThe inclusion of wealth-related bias also yields—and gives a precise mathematical definition to—the phenomenon of partial oligarchy.\n\nWhenever the influence of wealth-attained advantage exceeds that of redistribution (more precisely, whenever ζ exceeds χ), a vanishingly small fraction of people will possess a finite fraction, 1 − χ/ζ, of societal wealth.\n\nThe onset of partial oligarchy is in fact a phase transition for another model of economic transactions, as first described in 2000 by physicists Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, now at École Polytechnique, and Marc Mézard of the École Normale Supérieure.\n\nIn our model, when ζ is less than χ, the system has only one stable state with no oligarchy; when ζ exceeds χ, a new, oligarchical state appears and becomes the stable state [see graphic above].\n\nThe two-parameter (χ and ζ) extended yard sale model thus obtained can match empirical data on U.S. and European wealth distribution between 1989 and 2016 to within 1 to 2 percent.\n\nSuch a phase transition may have played a crucial role in the condensation of wealth following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nThe imposition of what was called shock therapy economics on the former states of the U.S.S.R. resulted in a dramatic decrease of wealth redistribution (that is, decreasing χ) by their governments and a concomitant jump in wealth-attained advantage (increasing ζ) from the combined effects of sudden privatization and deregulation.\n\nThe resulting decrease of the “temperature” χ/ζ threw the countries into a wealth-condensed state, so that formerly communist countries became partial oligarchies almost overnight.\n\nTo the present day at least 10 of the 15 former Soviet republics can be accurately described as oligarchies.\n\nAs a third refinement, in 2019 we included negative wealth—one of the more disturbing aspects of modern economies—in our model.\n\nIn 2016, for example, approximately 10.5 percent of the U.S. population was in net debt because of mortgages, student loans and other factors.\n\nSo we introduced a third parameter, κ (or “kappa”), which shifts the wealth distribution downward, thereby accounting for negative wealth.\n\nWe supposed that the least wealth the poorest agent could have at any time was –S, where S equals κ times the mean wealth.\n\nPrior to each transaction, we loaned wealth S to both agents so that each had positive wealth.\n\nThey then transacted according to the extended yard sale model, described earlier, after which they both repaid their debt of S.\n\nThe three-parameter (χ, ζ, κ) model thus obtained, called the affine wealth model, can match empirical data on U.S. wealth distribution to less than a sixth of a percent over a span of three decades.\n\nAgreement with European wealth-distribution data for 2010 is typically better than a third to a half of a percent.\n\nTo obtain these comparisons with actual data, we had to solve the “inverse problem.” That is, given the empirical wealth distribution, we had to find the values of (χ, ζ, κ) at which the results of our model most closely matched it.\n\nAs just one example, the 2016 U.S. household wealth distribution is best described as having χ = 0.036, ζ = 0.050 and κ = 0.058.\n\nThe affine wealth model has been applied to empirical data from many countries and epochs.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, it describes wealth-distribution data more accurately than any other existing model.\n\nWe find it noteworthy that the best-fitting model for empirical wealth distribution discovered so far is one that would be completely unstable without redistribution rather than one based on a supposed equilibrium of market forces.\n\nIn fact, these mathematical models demonstrate that far from wealth trickling down to the poor, the natural inclination of wealth is to flow upward, so that the “natural” wealth distribution in a free-market economy is one of complete oligarchy.\n\nIt is only redistribution that sets limits on inequality.\n\nThe mathematical models also call attention to the enormous extent to which wealth distribution is caused by symmetry breaking, chance and early advantage (from, for example, inheritance).\n\nAnd the presence of symmetry breaking puts paid to arguments for the justness of wealth inequality that appeal to “voluntariness”—the notion that individuals bear all responsibility for their economic outcomes simply because they enter into transactions voluntarily—or to the idea that wealth accumulation must be the result of cleverness and industriousness.\n\nIt is true that an individual's location on the wealth spectrum correlates to some extent with such attributes, but the overall shape of that spectrum can be explained to better than 0.33 percent by a statistical model

    "title": "The Wealth Gap in the U.S. Is Worse Than In Russia or Iran",
    "domain": "fortune.com",
    "text": "According to New York Times columnist David Brooks, socioeconomic segregation is ruining America. “Housing and construction rules that keep the poor and less educated away from places with good schools and good job opportunities…have a devastating effect on economic growth nationwide,” Brooks wrote in a much-derided July 11 column. (Derided not for the sentiment outlined above so much as the evidence, which involved Italian cold cuts as a restrictive cultural signifier for the American upper middle class.) Salami aside, Brooks has a point. There’s an widening gulf in the United States between the haves and the have-nots. The columnist points to education and metropolitan zoning restrictions as reinforcement for this unequal system, with statistics to support the argument. But how true is it? We asked urbanist, author, and University of Toronto professor Richard Florida to weigh in. (Florida is best-known for his concept of the “creative class.”) Here’s what he said, edited and condensed for clarity. When did this wealth gap problem start?\nBasically, this wealth gap that we see today is something that has really skyrocketed since about the 1980s and certainly in the past decade, decade and a half. How bad is the wealth inequality we’re seeing in the United States?\nThe income inequality in the United States, according to the Gini coefficient (a measure of inequality where 0 is perfectly equal and 1 is perfectly unequal) is about 0.45, which is awful—worse than Iran. How about in cities specifically?\nIn cities that inequality is even greater. There’s a table in my book (The New Urban Crisis, Basic Books, $28) showing this. Inequality in New York City is like Swaziland. Miami’s is like Zimbabwe. Los Angeles is equivalent to Sri Lanka. I actually look at the difference between the 95th percentile of income earners in big cities and the lower 20%. In the New York metro area, the 95th percentile makes $282,000 and the 20th percentile makes $23,000. These gaps between the rich and the poor in income and wealth are vast across the country and even worse in our cities. What is this idea of a “knowledge-based economy”?\nFirst introduced in the 1950s and 1960s by Fritz Malchup and Peter Drucker, the idea is that the economy is powered by knowledge, ideas and talent as opposed to resources and industry. Shouldn’t having access to the same schools and being in close proximity to different socioeconomic classes make it easier to move out of your financial situation?\nThe research of other economists do show that in terms of upward mobility, living in cities like New York or San Francisco or Boston tends to be better for upward mobility than living in sprawling, more suburban areas. That said, what makes it harder —and this is the core theme of The New Urban Crisis—is that middle class neighborhoods are disappearing. In the past, most Americans lived in middle class neighborhoods, whether that was in the city or the suburbs. In the 1970s about 70% Americans lived in middle class neighborhoods. Now less than 40% of us do. And guess where middle class neighborhoods declined the most? In our largest, the most densest, knowledge-based metropolitan areas. Why have these middle class neighborhoods disappeared?\nNot only has income inequality and wealth inequality grown, the segregation of people not necessarily by race or by ethnicity—that’s a separate question—but by socioeconomic class has grown. The wealthy have moved to much more concentrated areas of wealth. And those areas are surrounded by areas with much more concentrated disadvantage. The wealthy and the well educated and the more affluent have walled themselves off in separate neighborhoods. The growth in economic segregation really occurred in the last decade. In our biggest cities we see the biggest loss of the middle class. We see the biggest gaps not only between wealth in general, but where rich people and more educated knowledge workers live and where less advantaged people live. Is the economic segregation perpetuated by zoning laws or individuals?\nI think it’s both. In the past, exclusionary zoning in the suburbs really functioned to keep poor people, less affluent people out. Today, I think the key factor is simply that wealthy, affluent people wanted to move back to cities. That’s what happens not only when wealthy people but creative people, affluent people, interesting people live in cities—they become more productive and more innovative. Cities become more attractive to high tech firms, innovative companies and creative organizations. So you have more competition for limited space. When you have more competition for limited space, the land value goes up. Then increasingly, you’ve got to be rich to afford space in a city. I think the zoning laws have contributed to it, but one thing I found interesting was that the biggest inequality, segregation and housing unaffordability occurred in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco—but Houston, a place that mostly doesn’t have zoning laws and building restrictions, is high on the list as well. David Brooks wrote a column for The New York Times a few weeks ago touching on the culture of urbanites and how that relates to the wealth gap and segregated neighborhoods. Are Brooks’ assertions about how the elites have created cultural barriers to socioeconomic mobility valid?\nI think it is a mistake to blame people who work hard, put work into selecting their partners and making sure their marriages work, and invest in their kids. Isn’t that what the American Dream is supposed to be about? I think the barriers are much more formal and institutional than informal. Is the geographic divide of the American people based on socioeconomic status a result of the wealth gap or is it an underlying cause perpetuating the widening wealth gap?\nThey reinforce one another. Doesn’t the clustering of innovation in a select few cities and states put places that depend less on knowledge-based economies at a disadvantage?\nWell those states are going to get left behind and they’re going to grow angrier and angrier. This is what I like to call the political contradiction of American capitalism, where the things we need to grow in our economy, increasingly larger portions of the country don’t want to invest in. How has the wealth gap affected the American people?\nThis gap between the rich and poor, the haves and the have-nots, is what produced the backlash that brought Donald Trump to power. Our country isn’t just divided by politics or class, it’s divided by where you live. The advantaged urban parts of the country by the coast—New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles—they’re the blue areas, but the rest of America is increasingly red. The wealth gap that’s occurring in places is behind the political backlash we’re seeing in our country. Can we reverse this divide that’s happening between large cities and rural areas?\nI think this, what I call spatial geographic inequality, is a deep fundamental characteristic of knowledge-based economies because what drives economic growth is a clustering of diverse, talented people in small areas. That’s where the basic force of economic growth comes from, so the more we cluster in New York or San Francisco or wherever, the more we drive economic growth. The more innovation we create, the more we compete for space and those housing values. The finance industry, the media industry, the music industry all cluster in certain places. I think it’s going to be very hard to counter this geographic inequality. How do we fix this?\nWe’re going to have to recognize that as Americans, we live in different places. Some want to live in dense, knowledge-based areas. Others will want to live in more suburban or rural parts of the country and pay less in taxes and spend less on schools. Across the country, people are going to want different things. We’re going to have to move from a highly centralized federal system to a system where our cities, suburbs and metropolitan areas can use their tax dollars to build the kinds of communities they want. By localizing governments, you can allow places to make the most of what they have. That way, we can begin to heal the divide in our country. Any last words?\nI think this inequality, not just between classes and wealth, but between locations is going to be the big issue of our time. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

    "onlytext": "According to New York Times columnist David Brooks, socioeconomic segregation is ruining America. “Housing and construction rules that keep the poor and less educated away from places with good schools and good job opportunities…have a devastating effect on economic growth nationwide,” Brooks wrote in a much-derided July 11 column. (Derided not for the sentiment outlined above so much as the evidence, which involved Italian cold cuts as a restrictive cultural signifier for the American upper middle class.) Salami aside, Brooks has a point. There’s an widening gulf in the United States between the haves and the have-nots. The columnist points to education and metropolitan zoning restrictions as reinforcement for this unequal system, with statistics to support the argument. But how true is it? We asked urbanist, author, and University of Toronto professor Richard Florida to weigh in. (Florida is best-known for his concept of the “creative class.”) Here’s what he said, edited and condensed for clarity. When did this wealth gap problem start?\nBasically, this wealth gap that we see today is something that has really skyrocketed since about the 1980s and certainly in the past decade, decade and a half. How bad is the wealth inequality we’re seeing in the United States?\nThe income inequality in the United States, according to the Gini coefficient (a measure of inequality where 0 is perfectly equal and 1 is perfectly unequal) is about 0.45, which is awful—worse than Iran. How about in cities specifically?\nIn cities that inequality is even greater. There’s a table in my book (The New Urban Crisis, Basic Books, $28) showing this. Inequality in New York City is like Swaziland. Miami’s is like Zimbabwe. Los Angeles is equivalent to Sri Lanka. I actually look at the difference between the 95th percentile of income earners in big cities and the lower 20%. In the New York metro area, the 95th percentile makes $282,000 and the 20th percentile makes $23,000. These gaps between the rich and the poor in income and wealth are vast across the country and even worse in our cities. What is this idea of a “knowledge-based economy”?\nFirst introduced in the 1950s and 1960s by Fritz Malchup and Peter Drucker, the idea is that the economy is powered by knowledge, ideas and talent as opposed to resources and industry. Shouldn’t having access to the same schools and being in close proximity to different socioeconomic classes make it easier to move out of your financial situation?\nThe research of other economists do show that in terms of upward mobility, living in cities like New York or San Francisco or Boston tends to be better for upward mobility than living in sprawling, more suburban areas. That said, what makes it harder —and this is the core theme of The New Urban Crisis—is that middle class neighborhoods are disappearing. In the past, most Americans lived in middle class neighborhoods, whether that was in the city or the suburbs. In the 1970s about 70% Americans lived in middle class neighborhoods. Now less than 40% of us do. And guess where middle class neighborhoods declined the most? In our largest, the most densest, knowledge-based metropolitan areas. Why have these middle class neighborhoods disappeared?\nNot only has income inequality and wealth inequality grown, the segregation of people not necessarily by race or by ethnicity—that’s a separate question—but by socioeconomic class has grown. The wealthy have moved to much more concentrated areas of wealth. And those areas are surrounded by areas with much more concentrated disadvantage. The wealthy and the well educated and the more affluent have walled themselves off in separate neighborhoods. The growth in economic segregation really occurred in the last decade. In our biggest cities we see the biggest loss of the middle class. We see the biggest gaps not only between wealth in general, but where rich people and more educated knowledge workers live and where less advantaged people live. Is the economic segregation perpetuated by zoning laws or individuals?\nI think it’s both. In the past, exclusionary zoning in the suburbs really functioned to keep poor people, less affluent people out. Today, I think the key factor is simply that wealthy, affluent people wanted to move back to cities. That’s what happens not only when wealthy people but creative people, affluent people, interesting people live in cities—they become more productive and more innovative. Cities become more attractive to high tech firms, innovative companies and creative organizations. So you have more competition for limited space. When you have more competition for limited space, the land value goes up. Then increasingly, you’ve got to be rich to afford space in a city. I think the zoning laws have contributed to it, but one thing I found interesting was that the biggest inequality, segregation and housing unaffordability occurred in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco—but Houston, a place that mostly doesn’t have zoning laws and building restrictions, is high on the list as well. David Brooks wrote a column for The New York Times a few weeks ago touching on the culture of urbanites and how that relates to the wealth gap and segregated neighborhoods. Are Brooks’ assertions about how the elites have created cultural barriers to socioeconomic mobility valid?\nI think it is a mistake to blame people who work hard, put work into selecting their partners and making sure their marriages work, and invest in their kids. Isn’t that what the American Dream is supposed to be about? I think the barriers are much more formal and institutional than informal. Is the geographic divide of the American people based on socioeconomic status a result of the wealth gap or is it an underlying cause perpetuating the widening wealth gap?\nThey reinforce one another. Doesn’t the clustering of innovation in a select few cities and states put places that depend less on knowledge-based economies at a disadvantage?\nWell those states are going to get left behind and they’re going to grow angrier and angrier. This is what I like to call the political contradiction of American capitalism, where the things we need to grow in our economy, increasingly larger portions of the country don’t want to invest in. How has the wealth gap affected the American people?\nThis gap between the rich and poor, the haves and the have-nots, is what produced the backlash that brought Donald Trump to power. Our country isn’t just divided by politics or class, it’s divided by where you live. The advantaged urban parts of the country by the coast—New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles—they’re the blue areas, but the rest of America is increasingly red. The wealth gap that’s occurring in places is behind the political backlash we’re seeing in our country. Can we reverse this divide that’s happening between large cities and rural areas?\nI think this, what I call spatial geographic inequality, is a deep fundamental characteristic of knowledge-based economies because what drives economic growth is a clustering of diverse, talented people in small areas. That’s where the basic force of economic growth comes from, so the more we cluster in New York or San Francisco or wherever, the more we drive economic growth. The more innovation we create, the more we compete for space and those housing values. The finance industry, the media industry, the music industry all cluster in certain places. I think it’s going to be very hard to counter this geographic inequality. How do we fix this?\nWe’re going to have to recognize that as Americans, we live in different places. Some want to live in dense, knowledge-based areas. Others will want to live in more suburban or rural parts of the country and pay less in taxes and spend less on schools. Across the country, people are going to want different things. We’re going to have to move from a highly centralized federal system to a system where our cities, suburbs and metropolitan areas can use their tax dollars to build the kinds of communities they want. By localizing governments, you can allow places to make the most of what they have. That way, we can begin to heal the divide in our country. Any last words?\nI think this inequality, not just between classes and wealth, but between locations is going to be the big issue of our time.",

    "text": "Taking a modern-century spin on “Let them eat cake,” shareholders are having the whole cake, and eating it too. It’s no shock the boardroom is able to stay above the fray as wealthy members are more equipped to weather economic downturns. But it turns out CEOs and shareholders are walking away with an even greater slice of profits than one might think. So finds a recent report from Oxfam, a British nonprofit focused on eradicating poverty, which analyzed more than 200 U.S. corporations to assess their “inequality footprint.” Most money ends up funneling into the mouths of those at the top, as 90% (or $1.1 trillion) of the combined $1.25 trillion in net profits for those companies analyzed went to paying wealthy shareholders. \n\n\n\n Executives are doing quite all right as well. CEO pay has ballooned since the pandemic hit, increasing by 31% from 2018 to 2022. “Shareholders and CEO pay have risen to record levels in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis,” according to the report.\n\n\n\n “The rules are being rigged and the companies are helping to rig them,” Irit Tamir, senior director of Oxfam America’s private sector department, tells Fortune, speaking of company taxation that has gone down due to a strong corporate-lobbying presence. \n\n\n\n This past year has been marked by layoffs in the finance, tech, and media sectors as many CEOs claim to need to downsize in light of economic strain. But it seems as if corporations are doing better than ever. Revenue and profits at Fortune 500 companies grew significantly between 2014 and 2022, hiking even more in the years after the pandemic hit. In the same breath that Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg announced layoffs for more than 10,000 workers in the name of a “year of efficiency,” the company announced a fresh $40 billion stock-buyback option. Less than a year later, Meta announced plans to buy back another $50 billion.  \n While money was seemingly tight for some, it was an equivalent of Christmas for those at the top: Stock buybacks in 2022 hit a record of $681 billion, per Oxfam.\n\n\n\n The consolidation of power at the top has been a decades-long process. The concept of shareholder primacy started to take hold in the 1970s, per Tamir, who added that while companies started to prioritize this group, safeguards for workers were fading as union membership ebbed. In the 1980s, stock buybacks, once banned as a form of stock manipulation, became legal. Tamir says this change, specifically, allowed companies to inflate their stock prices. At the same time, corporate tax rates fell dramatically thanks to a series of tax cuts, first in the Reagan era and again during the Trump administration, while corporations gained more and more ability to directly influence politics, capped off with the 2010 Citizens United decision, in which the Supreme Court gave companies and wealthy individuals carte blanche to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.\n\n\n\n “All of those things together have created sort of this perfect storm by which companies have gotten bigger, corporate power is on the rise, and the benefits that they’ve accrued in profit they are funneling to a smaller number of people,” Tamir says, adding that the other stakeholders—the workers—“are losing out.” \n\n\n\n There are some signs of change. Unionization is growing in popularity after a year of strikes and some high-profile wins on behalf of workers—like the UAW and, recently, the Starbucks union. \n\n\n\n “There are some promising signs, but if we don’t continue down that path, we are already essentially in a new Gilded Age,” says Tamir, echoing President Joe Biden’s rhetoric on checking corporations more.  \n While wages remain fairly stagnant, or barely high enough to compete with the pace of inflation, CEOs have given themselves a hefty raise. CEOs were paid a combined $4.1 billion in 2022, per Oxfam’s analysis of the 186 companies that had hard data. Only 5% of the companies examined publicly said they support a living wage. The wage gap continues to widen among larger companies: McDonald’s, for instance, has a CEO-to-worker pay gap of 1,745 to one. Another prototypical American brand, the Coca-Cola Company, has a pay gap of 1,594 to one. \n\n\n\n The divide is most apparent in the retail sector. Retail workers are often people of color and women, though the top leaders at these companies are often white men, according to Oxfam. While many companies said they were looking to make DEI targets, many came up empty-handed when it came to hard data. \n\n\n\n “They are talking a good game, but when it comes to actually doing something about it, most are not doing anything that is at least transparent to the public,” Tamir says. “All of these things are technically legal and unfortunately to the detriment of the rest of us.” \n\n\n\n Tamir says in the long term, even the most wealthy will suffer. Dollar Tree might be the least equitable of the companies from a gender and racial perspective, according to Tamir, and earlier this year the company shut down 1,000 of its stores. \n\n\n\n “At the end of the day, this is bad for business,” Tamir explains. “Having wealth in the hands of fewer and fewer people is not good for an economy.” \n Read more of Fortune’s coverage on wealth, income, and inequality:\n A version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on March 18, 2024.   © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

    "text": "Published Aug 25, 2025 at 06:00 AM EDT CEO of the FCB Radio Network  Donald Trump claims Washington, D.C., needs the National Guard to get crime under control. Every time he says it, the same argument flares up: who's to blame for crime in America's cities? Progressive commentator Ed Krassenstein argued online that crime is really a red state problem, pointing to higher murder rates in Republican states. Conservative commentator Carmine Sabia, a friend of mine, shot back that Democratic mayors are responsible since they run most of the big cities. They're both wrong. And this is exactly the problem with the way we talk about crime in America. Everyone wants to use it as a political football. The truth is much simpler, and much harder: crime doesn't follow party lines. It follows poverty. The federal government's own numbers prove it. In 2023, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that people in households making under $25,000 a year were almost three times more likely to be victims of violent crime than those in households making more than $200,000. That's not red states versus blue states. That's poor versus rich. The same pattern shows up when you look at neighborhoods. The National Neighborhood Crime Study found that violent crime rises as poverty rises, regardless of whether the neighborhood is white, Black, Latino, or mixed. Once poverty is factored in, the racial gap in crime shrinks dramatically. In plain English, a poor white neighborhood and a poor Black neighborhood have more in common with each other than either does with a wealthy neighborhood. Columbus, Ohio, proved this point. Researchers found that when neighborhood poverty climbed above 40 percent, violent crime spiked. It didn't matter whether the residents were Black or white. Poverty was the trigger. Cleveland shows how those conditions were created and sustained. A 2018 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland found that neighborhoods redlined in the 1930s are still the poorest, most crime-affected parts of the city today. Eight decades later, the legacy of disinvestment is still visible. And this isn't just about cities. Rural America tells the same story. Stilwell, Oklahoma, a small Republican-majority town, has a violent crime rate about double the national average. Nearly half its children live below the poverty line. The problem isn't who the mayor is. The problem is entrenched poverty. That's why the partisan finger-pointing rings hollow. Yes, some red states have higher statewide murder rates. Yes, Democratic-run cities record more murders in raw numbers. Both statements are true. Neither one explains the real issue. Now, crime policy isn't irrelevant. It matters. Progressive Democrats can be too lax when it comes to fighting crime, and that has to be addressed. You can't ignore the symptoms. But if you're only focused on policing tactics and never address poverty, you're treating the fever without curing the disease. We have to deal with both the symptom and the cause. And it's worth remembering that not every big-city Democrat even fits the caricature partisans like to paint. Many mayors and city council members are moderates who spend as much time fighting progressives as they do fighting Republicans. Yet in the national debate, they get lumped in with those progressives as if they all share the same ideology. They don't. What would actually move the needle is cooperation. Red state governors and blue city mayors should be working together to address poverty instead of using crime as a talking point. That kind of partnership—not endless partisan bickering—actually helps people. If we want safer streets, the only way forward is tackling poverty head-on: schools that work, jobs that pay, communities that are invested in instead of ignored. Because until we do that, crime will remain highest where poverty is deepest. And politicians will keep using it as a football instead of fixing it.

While the bill would be a boon to wealthy Americans, it would scale back resources for the nation's poorest households, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) warned in a recent letter to lawmakers. In an effort to pay for an extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, Republicans in both the House and Senate want to change or reduce key social safety net programs that provide health care, food benefits and financial assistance for millions of children. Here's what to know. More than 37 million children are enrolled in either Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a federal program that provides affordable health insurance to pregnant mothers and children who live just above Medicaid's poverty threshold. Combined, Medicaid and CHIP protect nearly half of all children in the United States, beginning with important prenatal care, covering over 40% of U.S. births as well as nearly half of all rural births, and continuing to insure millions of vulnerable children into young adulthood. Congressional Republicans want to continue to allow states to impose waiting periods before families can enroll in CHIP and to lock them out of the program if they fail to keep up with premiums. They also propose changing Medicaid to include a first-ever national work requirement. As the House bill is written, it would exempt parents, \"but what we've seen from past experience with work requirements is that exemptions are not always effective,\" says Allison Orris, director of Medicaid policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Senate Republicans propose going even further, with a part-time work requirement including parents of children over 14. \"If [parents'] earnings go up because they're complying, that actually could be good for the kids,\" says Kevin Corinth, who studies poverty and safety net programs at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute (AEI). \"Because there is good research showing that, when parents work and we get more earnings coming into the household, that can improve current and future outcomes [for children].\" In addition to work requirements, Republicans are proposing other changes that would create new administrative hurdles for families, according to Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families. \"When there's more red tape, we know that it's harder for families,\" says Joan Alker, head of the center and a Georgetown research professor. \"To see these kinds of cuts is very, very scary.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson's office defended the changes in a press release, writing that \"Republicans are protecting and strengthening Medicaid for American citizens who need and deserve it by rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.\" He also claimed on NBC's Meet the Press, \"there are no Medicaid cuts in the Big, Beautiful Bill. We're not cutting Medicaid.\" Yet CBO estimates the House bill would cut federal spending on Medicaid by roughly $800 billion over the next decade, and the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation focused on improving health care access, estimates 1 in 5 children could be at risk of losing their Medicaid coverage if the House proposal goes into place. Alker says the House changes would force states to make difficult decisions about whether to cut services or raise taxes. \"Governors are gonna have to do the dirty work,\" she says. And the Senate's proposal, she warns, would be even harder on states. According to research by CBO, consistent Medicaid coverage in childhood increases earnings in adulthood, which increases tax revenue and can gradually repay the federal government for its early investment. In fact, CBO found, \"increasing children's enrollment in Medicaid would reduce the future federal deficit by between roughly $800 and $3,400 per child per year of enrollment.\" House Republicans have also proposed big changes to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, which, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, helps pay for groceries for more than 15 million children in the U.S. This bill would bring \"the deepest cut to food assistance in history,\" says Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for food assistance at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The House bill would expand SNAP's existing work requirements, though Bergh says \"research has repeatedly shown that this doesn't increase people's employment. It doesn't increase their earnings. It just cuts people off of SNAP and leaves them hungry.\" The House bill would also cut more than $290 billion from SNAP over 10 years – a cut Bergh estimates would \"eliminate or substantially reduce\" food assistance for more than 2 million children. And the House proposal could, for the first time in the history of SNAP, put states on the hook for between 5% and 25% of the cost of food benefits. Whether this shift in funding, from the federal government onto states, is a good idea is \"debatable,\" says AEI's Corinth, though he points to one potential upside: It could force states to have \"more skin in the game.\" One potential downside, according to CBO, is that some states \"would modify benefits or eligibility or possibly leave [SNAP] altogether because of the increased costs.\" And for children, losing access to SNAP benefits could hurt them in more ways than one, as they would also lose their automatic enrollment in free meals at school. In its analysis of the overall impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill, CBO estimates resources for the poorest households \"would decrease by about $1,600 per year,\" a loss \"mainly attributable\" to cuts in the social safety net, including Medicaid and SNAP. By contrast, CBO predicts the wealthiest households would see an average annual gain of $12,000. House Republicans hotly dispute CBO's math, with Speaker Mike Johnson claiming \"the biggest beneficiaries of this [bill] will be low- and middle-income Americans.\" Senate Republicans' proposal mirrors the House proposal in many ways, including a work requirement and significant cost-shifting onto states. Senate Republicans are proposing updates that could improve and expand access to a handful of tax benefits that help families pay for child care, including the Child and Dependent Care tax credit. \"Expanding child care tax credits in the Senate bill is a step in the right direction toward making care more affordable and accessible for families nationwide,\" Sarah Rittling, executive director of First Five Years Fund, said in a statement. Her organization advocates for affordable access to quality child care and early learning. Researchers and child policy experts are less supportive of proposed changes to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC). The EITC is essentially an anti-poverty program in the form of a refundable tax credit that AEI's Kevin Corinth points out provides low-income, working families with extra help. Congressional Republicans are proposing additional administrative hurdles that families would have to overcome to qualify. Namely, requiring that they go through an onerous precertification process for their children before being able to claim the credit. This additional step would be a burden not only on families but on the IRS, which has been the subject of severe staff cuts by the Trump administration. Then there's the current Child Tax Credit, which can lower a family's tax bill by up to $2,000 per child. House Republicans want to increase that to $2,500. But households have to earn a certain amount of income to be eligible for the full credit. Republicans are also \"making what is, in theory, a new higher credit much harder for families with children to actually receive,\" says Megan Curran, policy director with the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University. Current law requires children to be either U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents to be eligible for the CTC. The House bill could disqualify more than 4.5 million children, Curran estimates, because it would require both parents to have a Social Security number. The Senate bill would require that only one parent have a Social Security number for their child to be eligible. It's unclear how many children that change would still disqualify.  The bill would also continue current policy, blocking the lowest-income families from qualifying for the full tax credit. \"Under current policy, a two-adult, two-child family needs at least $36,000 [in income] in order to get the full [credit],\" Curran says. \"That's 1 in 4 kids nationwide who are left out of the full credit.\" On the other hand, wealthy households earning up to $200,000 for individuals, or $400,000 for couples, can claim the full credit.  This disparity would get even more pronounced if the credit grows, Curran says, with that two-adult, two-child family now needing to earn $48,000 to claim the full credit. \"As a result, under the House Reconciliation Bill, 1 out of every 3 children would be left out of the full credit nationwide,\" Curran says. Senate Republicans are pitching a smaller increase to the CTC, to $2,200, but the underlying machinery would similarly limit the benefit for the lowest-income households. Many countries employ some kind of child benefit for families, but Curran says the U.S. is unusual in that \"we exclude the families with lower and moderate incomes. And those are children who arguably could really benefit from this type of investment the most.\" In 2021, Congress briefly increased and expanded the child tax credit to include the nation's lowest-income families. The expansion was short-lived — just six months — but research shows it helped cut the share of children living in poverty by nearly half. Research shows investing in vulnerable children isn't just a benefit to them and their families, it also provides lifetime returns to the nation. \"Every dollar that you spend on the child tax credit in an expanded form that reaches all kids would return at least $10 a year,\" Curran says. That's because children would be healthier, she says, and do better in school. Later, they would get better jobs and pay more back into the system, in the form of taxes.

    "text": "The state, which has long ranked worst in the US for child wellbeing, became the first and only in the country to offer free childcare to a majority of families There was a moment, just before the pandemic, when Lisset Sanchez thought she might have to drop out of college because the cost of keeping her three children in daycare was just too much. Even with support from the state, she and her husband were paying $800 a month – about half of what Sanchez and her husband paid for their mortgage in Las Cruces, New Mexico. But during the pandemic, that cost went down to $0. And Sanchez was not only able to finish college, but enroll in nursing school. With a scholarship that covered her tuition and free childcare, Sanchez could afford to commute to school, buy groceries for her growing family – even after she had two more children – and pay down the family’s mortgage and car loan. “We are a one-income household,” said Sanchez, whose husband works while she is in school. Having free childcare “did help tremendously”. Around the same time, Ofelia Gonzalez and her sister began receiving assistance from the state to develop their at-home childcare center in south-western Albuquerque, called Mis Conejitos. The state started reimbursing their work at higher rates, which allowed them to buy toys and swings for the backyard, and raised wages for childcare workers across the state, which allowed Gonzalez to begin saving “so that I can have good credit and in time I can have my own home”, she said in Spanish. The changes in Sanchez and Gonzalez’s lives are intertwined. Three years ago, New Mexico became the first state in the nation to offer free childcare to a majority of families. The United States has no federal, universal childcare – and ranks 40th on a Unicef ranking of 41 high-income countries’ childcare policies, while maintaining some of the highest childcare costs in the world. Expanding on pandemic-era assistance, New Mexico made childcare free for families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level, or about $124,000 for a family of four. That meant about half of New Mexican children now qualified. In one of the poorest states in the nation, where the median household income is half that and childcare costs for two children could take up 80% of a family’s income, the impact was powerful. The state, which had long ranked worst in the nation for child wellbeing, saw its poverty rate begin to fall. As the state simultaneously raised wages for childcare workers, and became the first to base its subsidy reimbursement rates on the actual cost of providing such care, early childhood educators were also raised out of poverty. In 2020, 27.4% of childcare providers – often women of color – were living in poverty. By 2024, that number had fallen to 16%. During the state’s recent legislative session, lawmakers approved a “historic” increase in funding for education, including early childhood education, that might improve those numbers even further. “This is a big investment that we know is going to pay off,” said Elizabeth Groginsky, cabinet secretary of New Mexico’s nascent early childhood education and care department. She points to research from the Nobel-winning economist James Heckman that “every dollar spent on high-quality, birth-to-five programs for disadvantaged children can deliver a 13% per annum return on investment from better education and health outcomes for children, employment gains for parents, greater economic productivity and reduced spending on healthcare and crime. “The governor has seen that this investment in our human capital is as important as all the investments we’re making in our infrastructure,” said Groginsky. Despite the fact that widespread poverty has kept the state’s child wellbeing rates low, “New Mexico had, almost from statehood, a real culture around caring for children,” said Hailey Heinz, a senior research scientist and deputy director of the University of New Mexico’s Cradle to Career Policy Institute. Both Republican and Democratic administrations have never been “particularly stingy with the social safety net”, she said, citing the Democratic lieutenant governor, Diane Denish, who led efforts to offer free pre-kindergarten to all the state’s four-year-olds in 2005, and the Republican governor, Susana Martinez, who expanded Medicaid in 2013. After Medicaid was expanded in the state, a coalition of community groups came together to advocate for the next policy they thought could advance child wellbeing: universal childcare. When now-governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced her candidacy in late 2016, she emphasized her desire to address the state’s low child wellbeing rating. And when she took office in January 2018, she described her aim to have a “moonshot for education”: major investments in education across the state, from early childhood through college. That led to her opening the state’s early childhood education and care department in 2019 – and tapping Groginksy, who had overseen efforts to improve early childhood policies in Washington DC, to run it. Then, in 2020, Lujan Grisham threw her support behind a bill in the state legislature that would establish an Early Childhood Trust Fund: by investing $300m – plus budget surpluses each year, largely from oil and gas revenue – the state hoped to distribute a percentage to fund early childhood education each year. But then, just weeks after the trust fund was established, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. “Covid created a really enormous moment for childcare,” said Heinz. “We had somewhat of a national reckoning about the fact that we don’t have a workforce if we don’t have childcare.” As federal funding flooded into New Mexico, the state directed millions of dollars toward childcare, including by boosting pay for entry-level childcare providers to $15 an hour, expanding eligibility for free childcare to families making 400% of the poverty level, and becoming the first state in the nation to set childcare subsidy rates at the true cost of delivering care. “The governor saw this as an opportunity to accelerate and advance her agenda for children and families because we had the relief money,” said Groginsky. As pandemic-era relief funding dried up in 2022, the governor and Democratic lawmakers proposed another way to generate funds for childcare – directing a portion of the state’s Land Grant Permanent Fund to early childhood education and care. Like the Early Childhood Trust Fund, the permanent fund – which was established when New Mexico became a state – was funded by taxes on fossil fuel revenues. That November, 70% of New Mexican voters approved a constitutional amendment directing 1.25% of the fund to early childhood programs. By then, the Early Childhood Trust Fund had grown exponentially – due to the boom in oil and gas prices. Beginning with $300m in 2020, the fund had swollen to over $9bn by the end of 2024. The second greatest oil- and gas-producing state in the US, much of New Mexico’s state budget comes from fossil fuels. “It’s the blessing and curse of living in New Mexico,” said Gabrielle Uballez, executive director of NM Voices for Children. But while oil and gas is booming, she says advocates hope to “take advantage of that so that kids and families are benefiting – not the oil and gas industry by itself, and not corporations by itself”. New Mexico has long had one of the highest “official poverty rates” in the nation. But using a metric that accounts for social safety net programs – like universal childcare – that’s slowly shifting. According to “supplemental poverty” data, 17.1% of New Mexicans fell below the federal “supplemental” poverty line from 2013 to 2015 (a metric that takes into account cost of living and social supports) – making it the fifth poorest state in the nation by that measure. But today, that number has fallen to 10.9%, one of the biggest changes in the country, amounting to 120,000 fewer New Mexicans living in poverty. New Mexico’s child wellbeing ranking – which is based heavily on “official poverty” rankings – probably won’t budge, says Heinz because “the amount of money coming into households, that they have to run their budget, remains very low. “However, the thing New Mexico has done that’s fairly tremendous, I think, is around families not having to have as much money going out,” she said. During the recent legislative session, lawmakers deepened their investments in early childhood education even further, approving a 21.6% increase of $170m for education programs – including early childhood education. However, other legislation that advocates had hoped might pass stalled in the legislature, including a bill to require businesses to offer paid family medical leave. In her budget recommendations, Lujan Grisham asked the state to up its commitment to early childhood policies, by raising the wage floor for childcare workers to $18 an hour and establishing a career lattice for them. Because of that, Gonzalez has been able to start working on her associate’s in childhood education at Central New Mexico Community College where her tuition is waived. The governor also backed a house bill that will increase the amount of money distributed annually from the Early Childhood Trust Fund – since its dramatic growth due to oil and gas revenues. Although funding childcare through the Land Grant Permanent Fund is unique to New Mexico – and a handful of other states with permanent funds, like Alaska, Texas and North Dakota – Heinz says the Early Childhood Trust fund “holds interesting lessons for other states” about investing a percentage of revenues into early childhood programs. In New Mexico, those revenues come largely from oil and gas, but New Mexico Voices for Children has put forth recommendations about how the state can continue funding childcare while transitioning away from fossil fuels, largely by raising taxes on the state’s wealthiest earners. Although other states have not yet followed in New Mexico’s footsteps, a growing number are making strides to offer free pre-K to a majority of their residents. Heinz cautions that change won’t occur overnight. “What New Mexico is trying to do here is play a very long game. And so I am not without worry that people might give it five years, and it’s been almost five years now, and then say, where are the results? Why is everything not better?” she said. “This is generational change” that New Mexico is only just beginning to witness as the first children who were recipients of universal childcare start school. Sanchez urges other New Mexican families to take advantage of the opportunity to access free childcare. “Being able to work for free or go to school for free, that can make a big difference in your life and your children’s – everybody’s – life.”",

As the state simultaneously raised wages for childcare workers, and became the first to base its subsidy reimbursement rates on the actual cost of providing such care, early childhood educators were also raised out of poverty. In 2020, 27.4% of childcare providers – often women of color – were living in poverty. By 2024, that number had fallen to 16%.\n\nDuring the state’s recent legislative session, lawmakers approved a “historic” increase in funding for education, including early childhood education, that might improve those numbers even further. “This is a big investment that we know is going to pay off,” said Elizabeth Groginsky, cabinet secretary of New Mexico’s nascent early childhood education and care department. She points to research from the Nobel-winning economist James Heckman that “every dollar spent on high-quality, birth-to-five programs for disadvantaged children can deliver a 13% per annum return on investment from better education and health outcomes for children, employment gains for parents, greater economic productivity and reduced spending on healthcare and crime.\n\n“The governor has seen that this investment in our human capital is as important as all the investments we’re making in our infrastructure,” said Groginsky.\n\nDespite the fact that widespread poverty has kept the state’s child wellbeing rates low, “New Mexico had, almost from statehood, a real culture around caring for children,” said Hailey Heinz, a senior research scientist and deputy director of the University of New Mexico’s Cradle to Career Policy Institute. Both Republican and Democratic administrations have never been “particularly stingy with the social safety net”, she said, citing the Democratic lieutenant governor, Diane Denish, who led efforts to offer free pre-kindergarten to all the state’s four-year-olds in 2005, and the Republican governor, Susana Martinez, who expanded Medicaid in 2013.\n\nAfter Medicaid was expanded in the state, a coalition of community groups came together to advocate for the next policy they thought could advance child wellbeing: universal childcare. When now-governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced her candidacy in late 2016, she emphasized her desire to address the state’s low child wellbeing rating. And when she took office in January 2018, she described her aim to have a “moonshot for education”: major investments in education across the state, from early childhood through college.\n\nThat led to her opening the state’s early childhood education and care department in 2019 – and tapping Groginksy, who had overseen efforts to improve early childhood policies in Washington DC, to run it. Then, in 2020, Lujan Grisham threw her support behind a bill in the state legislature that would establish an Early Childhood Trust Fund: by investing $300m – plus budget surpluses each year, largely from oil and gas revenue – the state hoped to distribute a percentage to fund early childhood education each year.\n\nBut then, just weeks after the trust fund was established, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic. “Covid created a really enormous moment for childcare,” said Heinz. “We had somewhat of a national reckoning about the fact that we don’t have a workforce if we don’t have childcare.” As federal funding flooded into New Mexico, the state directed millions of dollars toward childcare, including by boosting pay for entry-level childcare providers to $15 an hour, expanding eligibility for free childcare to families making 400% of the poverty level, and becoming the first state in the nation to set childcare subsidy rates at the true cost of delivering care.\n\n“The governor saw this as an opportunity to accelerate and advance her agenda for children and families because we had the relief money,” said Groginsky.\n\nAs pandemic-era relief funding dried up in 2022, the governor and Democratic lawmakers proposed another way to generate funds for childcare – directing a portion of the state’s Land Grant Permanent Fund to early childhood education and care. Like the Early Childhood Trust Fund, the permanent fund – which was established when New Mexico became a state – was funded by taxes on fossil fuel revenues. That November, 70% of New Mexican voters approved a constitutional amendment directing 1.25% of the fund to early childhood programs.\n\nBy then, the Early Childhood Trust Fund had grown exponentially – due to the boom in oil and gas prices. Beginning with $300m in 2020, the fund had swollen to over $9bn by the end of 2024.\n\nThe second greatest oil- and gas-producing state in the US, much of New Mexico’s state budget comes from fossil fuels. “It’s the blessing and curse of living in New Mexico,” said Gabrielle Uballez, executive director of NM Voices for Children. But while oil and gas is booming, she says advocates hope to “take advantage of that so that kids and families are benefiting – not the oil and gas industry by itself, and not corporations by itself”.\n\nNew Mexico has long had one of the highest “official poverty rates” in the nation. But using a metric that accounts for social safety net programs – like universal childcare – that’s slowly shifting. According to “supplemental poverty” data, 17.1% of New Mexicans fell below the federal “supplemental” poverty line from 2013 to 2015 (a metric that takes into account cost of living and social supports) – making it the fifth poorest state in the nation by that measure. But today, that number has fallen to 10.9%, one of the biggest changes in the country, amounting to 120,000 fewer New Mexicans living in poverty.\n\nNew Mexico’s child wellbeing ranking – which is based heavily on “official poverty” rankings – probably won’t budge, says Heinz because “the amount of money coming into households, that they have to run their budget, remains very low. “However, the thing New Mexico has done that’s fairly tremendous, I think, is around families not having to have as much money going out,” she said.\n\nDuring the recent legislative session, lawmakers deepened their investments in early childhood education even further, approving a 21.6% increase of $170m for education programs – including early childhood education. However, other legislation that advocates had hoped might pass stalled in the legislature, including a bill to require businesses to offer paid family medical leave.\n\nIn her budget recommendations, Lujan Grisham asked the state to up its commitment to early childhood policies, by raising the wage floor for childcare workers to $18 an hour and establishing a career lattice for them. Because of that, Gonzalez has been able to start working on her associate’s in childhood education at Central New Mexico Community College where her tuition is waived.\n\nThe governor also backed a house bill that will increase the amount of money distributed annually from the Early Childhood Trust Fund – since its dramatic growth due to oil and gas revenues.\n\nAlthough funding childcare through the Land Grant Permanent Fund is unique to New Mexico – and a handful of other states with permanent funds, like Alaska, Texas and North Dakota – Heinz says the Early Childhood Trust fund “holds interesting lessons for other states” about investing a percentage of revenues into early childhood programs. In New Mexico, those revenues come largely from oil and gas, but New Mexico Voices for Children has put forth recommendations about how the state can continue funding childcare while transitioning away from fossil fuels, largely by raising taxes on the state’s wealthiest earners.\n\nAlthough other states have not yet followed in New Mexico’s footsteps, a growing number are making strides to offer free pre-K to a majority of their residents. Heinz cautions that change won’t occur overnight. “What New Mexico is trying to do here is play a very long game. And so I am not without worry that people might give it five years, and it’s been almost five years now, and then say, where are the results? Why is everything not better?” she said. “This is generational change” that New Mexico is only just beginning to witness as the first children who were recipients of universal childcare start school.\n\nSanchez urges other New Mexican families to take advantage of the opportunity to access free childcare. “Being able to work for free or go to school for free, that can make a big difference in your life and your children’s – everybody’s – life.”",

    "domain": "abcnews.go.com",
    "text": "Social, economic and political conditions mirror those seen in the late 1800s. As economic inequality and wealth concentration rise, the U.S. is entering a new era of support for workers' rights, reminiscent of the Gilded Age. This historical period -- which ran from the 1870s and to the early 20th century -- saw rapid industrialization and significant wealth disparity, with a small elite growing rich while the working class faced poverty. Modern labor movements are at the forefront, increasingly challenging income inequality and drawing parallels to earlier struggles, keeping the fight for workers' rights alive. Just this week Boeing workers voted down a contract proposal from the company, choosing to strike until a better deal is made. From the elegant HBO series \"The Gilded Age\" to the glamorous 2022 Met Gala, the influence of this opulent era and its excessive fashion continues to shine. \"It's an age of unprecedented wealth, creation of amazing technological innovation, like the advent of electricity, electric lights,\" historian Edward O'Donnell told ABC News. \"We don't think of railroads as high-tech, but they were high-tech in those days.\" While the Gilded Age was marked by extravagance, O'Donnell noted that it was also characterized by feelings of uncertainty driven by the working class. \"The Gilded Age is very much a time of, sort of a tale of two kinds of America. One where things are going great,\" he said. \"And at the same time, there's a lot that people are saying we seem to be heading in a really dark direction.\" Similar to the Gilded Age, we're seeing unions battle big corporations, increasing concerns about wealth inequality and anxiety over immigration. With the upcoming election highlighting economic anxiety and an increasing number of billionaires in the U.S., some historians believe we may be experiencing a second Gilded Age. \"We did many things policy and law wise in the 1980s and '90s that changed the game, that changed our tax structure, changed – almost eradicated – deregulation of Wall Street and so forth, and so that the rules have changed in the favor of the super wealthy,\" O'Donnell said. Wealth distribution in the U.S. shows that the top 10% of households hold 62% of the country's wealth, compared to the 5.7% held by the bottom 50%. The combined net worth of the top five richest Americans on the Forbes list has reached an astonishing $840 billion. Extreme luxury is returning, which is evident in the increasing number of mega-mansions. Superyachts are also sailing worldwide, with some selling for hundreds of millions of dollars. Among them is the world's largest sailboat, owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Janelle Jones is the vice president for policy and advocacy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth and first Black woman to become the U.S. Department of Labor's chief economist. She said the current level of inequality is \"unsustainable.\" \"Over the past 45 years, CEOs have made over a thousand times more than a typical worker,\" Jones said. \"For the typical worker, the pay has only increased 24%. Last year, CEOs made more than 300 times the typical worker.\" Jones previously served as the chief economist and policy director at the Service Employees International Union, comprising 2 million health care and public sector members. She views the current strikes as a reflection of growing frustration. Although many question the effectiveness of unions, Jones believes they represent a sure path to better economic mobility. \"In occupations and industries where unions are strong. We see that wage workers are earning more money,\" Jones said. \"They have more access to benefits. We also see that inequality is less in these occupations and industries. It's less between men and women and it's less between races.\" Despite their efforts, unions often face significant criticism as some negotiations do not result in substantial pay increases or meaningful changes in the workplace. Additionally, newly formed unions frequently struggle to bring corporations to the bargaining table. Jones believes achieving greater wealth equality will require federal policy. \"After the COVID pandemic and the recession, we started to see the way that policy can make sure there's a floor for everyone,\" she said. \"We started to see the way that it can raise living standards for everyone.\" Jones' proposal resembles the changes that ended the Gilded Age. In the early 20th century, we began to see the first forms of labor laws, which introduced shorter working hours, eventually leading to the eight-hour workday and establishing workers' compensation. \"The economy is not some, you know, force that rises above us,\" Jones said. \"It's not something that dictates what we can do. The economy is for us. We make the rules, we set the parameters, and we know that we can change those rules if we need to.\" ABC's News Phil Lipof help contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "title": "A $1 million wealth gap now divides white families from Black and Hispanic ones, research shows",
    "domain": "nbcnews.com",
    "text": "  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The average wealth gap between white families and Black and Hispanic ones reached a new high in 2022, topping $1 million in household wealth, according to a new report.  New research by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic and social policy research, found that the average wealth of white families in 2022 reached a record high of over $1.3 million, compared to about $227,000 for Hispanic families and $211,000 for Black families. This report marks the first time the institute has recorded a seven-figure disparity in average wealth for both Black and Hispanic households. The median wealth for white families was $284,000, compared to $62,000 for Hispanic families and $44,000 for Black families.  “Inequities measured at the median will give you a better sense of the comparisons across typical families, but inequities measured at the mean will give you a better sense of the macro-level disparities in wealth accumulation in this country — generally, and by race,” said Madeline Brown, a senior policy associate at the Urban Institute. She added that both numbers are important to consider because they are the result of structural racism. “One million dollars in a gap indicates that we still have severe racial wealth inequity in this country,” Brown said. That lifetime difference in accruing wealth severely affects families’ ability to “buy a home, invest in their children’s college, invest in their children’s businesses, support their families,” she added. The report shows how racial and gender gaps in earnings, retirement savings and emergency savings can contribute to a lifetime lag for individuals and families. But homeownership is the primary driver of wealth-building in the U.S., the report said, and continues to lag for Black families in particular because of “the stubborn legacy of racist housing policies.” The average white homeownership rate has increased from about 64.9% in 1960 to 73.1% in 2022, according to the report, while Black homeownership has gone from 38.2% to 44.3% in the same period. Hispanic and Asian families both saw their highest recorded average homeownership rates in 2022, at 51.1% and 63.2%, respectively, but still lagged behind the rates of white families. The research also found that significant disparities continue in individual lifetime earnings between white, Black and Hispanic people. Data shows the average white man born between 1960 and 1964 earned $2.9 million over the course of his career, compared to less than $1.8 million for the average Black man and about $1.7 million for Hispanic men. The average white woman in the same age bracket earned $1.7 million over the course of her career, compared to less than $1.3 million for Black women and $883,000 for Hispanic women. “In a nation that professes that those who work hard and play by the rules should be rewarded with social and economic upward mobility, these persistent disparities are a stark reminder that, as a society, we have not achieved this goal,” the report said. The Urban Institute’s data comes largely from the Survey of Consumer Finances conducted every three years by the Federal Reserve. The 2022 survey was the first time data was disaggregated for Asian Americans, who had the highest average family wealth of any group that year at $1.8 million. Other data shows that household income varies greatly among Asian American groups. When it comes to solutions, the report proposes a series of policy changes to help close the racial wealth gap, including limits to the mortgage interest tax deduction and reparations for Black Americans. “Looking at that $1 million gap, reparations are, depending on how they’re delivered, a promising policy in bringing that gap down,” Brown said. “Because the history is such that these policies have compounded on themselves and created a situation where, overall, our wealth distribution in this country is incredibly inequitable.” Isabela Espadas Barros Leal was a former platforms editor and associate editor for NBC News Digital. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

    "text": "ByChristian Weller, Senior Contributor. Wealth is the difference between what people own and what they owe. It serves as a financial buffer in an emergency and as a means toward upward economic mobility. People can use their wealth to buy a new house, move if better job opportunities open up elsewhere and support their families’ education, among other things.  Yet wealth is distributed in highly unequal ways, especially by race and ethnicity, and those gaps show no sign of abating. This leaves Black and Latino/Hispanic households in financially more vulnerable situations and with fewer opportunities for upward economic mobility.   The Federal Reserve’s Distributional Financial Accounts show, among other things, total wealth by race and ethnicity – for Black, Latino and white households. This dataset also includes quarterly estimates of the number of households in each racialized population category. The data then allow for the calculation of the average per-household wealth for Black, Latino/Hispanic and white households on a quarterly basis from 1989 to 2023.  The wealth differences between Black and Latino/Hispanic households, on the one side, and white households, on the other side, stayed large through 2023. Black households typically have less than one-fourth of the average wealth of white households. By September 2023, the latest quarter for which data are available, Black households owned 23.5% of the wealth of white households. The average wealth of Latino households was less than one-fifth — 19.2% — of that of white households (see figure below). Black and Latino households thus face greater risks and less economic mobility than is the case for white households.  Average wealth heavily skews toward wealthier households. Median wealth — which evenly divides groups by wealth — better reflects the typical household’s wealth in each group. Data from the Federal Reserve’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances shows that Black and Latino households also have much lower median wealth than was the case for white households in 2022, the last year for which these data are available.  For instance, the median wealth of African Americans amounted to $44,900 or 15.8% of the median wealth of white households ($285,000) in 2022. In comparison, the median Latino/Hispanic household owned $61,600 in 2022, or 21.6% of the median wealth of white households. By either measure — average or median wealth — Black and Latino/Hispanic households face greater economic risks or fewer economic opportunities than is the case for white households.  Importantly, the gaps in household wealth by race and ethnicity show few signs of diminishing. Average wealth grew substantially for all groups during and after the pandemic. But the wealth gaps by race and ethnicity stayed fairly constant. The average wealth of Black households amounted to 23.7% of the average wealth of white households in December 2019, before the pandemic and its financial market disruptions started (see figures below and above). The average wealth of Latino households equaled 18.6% of the average white household’s wealth then. At least the racial and ethnic wealth gaps did not worsen, as they did during and after the Great Recession (see figures below and above), and as they have been since 1989.  Less wealth means fewer financial protections during an emergency such as a family member getting sick, someone getting laid off or a car needing repairs, among other events. Black and Latino households had on average much fewer liquid dollars on average than was the case for white households. In September 2023, the average Black household owned $24,288 in checking accounts, money market mutual funds and other liquid savings. This was 14.5% of the average amount of liquid savings of $167,234 for white households at the same time. The total liquid savings of Latino households stood at $25,299 or 15.1% of what white households owned (see figure below).  Median liquid savings were much lower one year earlier in 2022, as data from the Survey of Consumer Finances shows. The median amount was $2,010 for Black households, $2,000 for Latino households and $12,000 for white households. Black and Latino households regularly have to face an economic emergency with smaller financial protections than is the case for white households.  Households, especially Black and Latino families, needed to dip into their savings repeatedly when inflation increased in late 2021 and early 2022. Many households had built up savings thanks to stimulus checks — officially known as Economic Impact Payments — and other benefits such as expanded child tax credits (see figure below). But, by September 2023, those extra savings were largely gone, in part to cover higher costs and in part to buy a house amid rising prices. Black households on average had $6,556 dollars less in liquid savings in September 2023 than in December 2019. In comparison, Latino households had roughly the same amount then as they did before the pandemic started, while white households had 13.4% more – or $19,768 (see figure below). Black and Latino households are regularly in a much worse position to weather a financial emergency than is the case for white households.  Part of the decline in liquid savings likely came from some households using those funds as down payments for a house amid rising real estate prices. The homeownership rates of all racial and ethnic groups grew during the pandemic, census data show. By the third quarter of 2023, 45.5% of Black households and 49.4% of Latino/Hispanic households owned their own house, while this was the case for 74.5% of white households. These numbers show more widespread homeownership than in 2019, when 44% of Black households, 48.1% of Latino/Hispanic households and 73.7% of white households owned their own home. But, considering the trend in liquid savings, especially Black and Latino/Hispanic homeowners increasingly face more risks than white households do.  Household wealth has increased for all population groups during the pandemic. Pre-existing wealth gaps by race and ethnicity largely stayed in place during that time.  While some households gained access to homeownership, that upward mobility may have come with greater short-term financial risks. In other words, Black and Latino/Hispanic households had to choose between a short-term financial safety blanket and longer-term economic mobility and stability more often than white households did.

    "onlytext": "Wealth is the difference between what people own and what they owe. It serves as a financial buffer in an emergency and as a means toward upward economic mobility. People can use their wealth to buy a new house, move if better job opportunities open up elsewhere and support their families’ education, among other things.  \n\nYet wealth is distributed in highly unequal ways, especially by race and ethnicity, and those gaps show no sign of abating. This leaves Black and Latino/Hispanic households in financially more vulnerable situations and with fewer opportunities for upward economic mobility.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s Distributional Financial Accounts show, among other things, total wealth by race and ethnicity – for Black, Latino and white households. This dataset also includes quarterly estimates of the number of households in each racialized population category. The data then allow for the calculation of the average per-household wealth for Black, Latino/Hispanic and white households on a quarterly basis from 1989 to 2023.\n\nThe wealth differences between Black and Latino/Hispanic households, on the one side, and white households, on the other side, stayed large through 2023. Black households typically have less than one-fourth of the average wealth of white households. By September 2023, the latest quarter for which data are available, Black households owned 23.5% of the wealth of white households. The average wealth of Latino households was less than one-fifth — 19.2% — of that of white households. Black and Latino households thus face greater risks and less economic mobility than is the case for white households.\n\nAverage wealth heavily skews toward wealthier households. Median wealth — which evenly divides groups by wealth — better reflects the typical household’s wealth in each group. Data from the Federal Reserve’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances shows that Black and Latino households also have much lower median wealth than was the case for white households in 2022, the last year for which these data are available.\n\nFor instance, the median wealth of African Americans amounted to $44,900 or 15.8% of the median wealth of white households ($285,000) in 2022. In comparison, the median Latino/Hispanic household owned $61,600 in 2022, or 21.6% of the median wealth of white households. By either measure — average or median wealth — Black and Latino/Hispanic households face greater economic risks or fewer economic opportunities than is the case for white households.\n\nImportantly, the gaps in household wealth by race and ethnicity show few signs of diminishing. Average wealth grew substantially for all groups during and after the pandemic. But the wealth gaps by race and ethnicity stayed fairly constant. The average wealth of Black households amounted to 23.7% of the average wealth of white households in December 2019, before the pandemic and its financial market disruptions started. The average wealth of Latino households equaled 18.6% of the average white household’s wealth then. At least the racial and ethnic wealth gaps did not worsen, as they did during and after the Great Recession, and as they have been since 1989.\n\nLess wealth means fewer financial protections during an emergency such as a family member getting sick, someone getting laid off or a car needing repairs, among other events. Black and Latino households had on average much fewer liquid dollars on average than was the case for white households. In September 2023, the average Black household owned $24,288 in checking accounts, money market mutual funds and other liquid savings. This was 14.5% of the average amount of liquid savings of $167,234 for white households at the same time. The total liquid savings of Latino households stood at $25,299 or 15.1% of what white households owned.\n\nMedian liquid savings were much lower one year earlier in 2022, as data from the Survey of Consumer Finances shows. The median amount was $2,010 for Black households, $2,000 for Latino households and $12,000 for white households. Black and Latino households regularly have to face an economic emergency with smaller financial protections than is the case for white households.\n\nHouseholds, especially Black and Latino families, needed to dip into their savings repeatedly when inflation increased in late 2021 and early 2022. Many households had built up savings thanks to stimulus checks — officially known as Economic Impact Payments — and other benefits such as expanded child tax credits. But, by September 2023, those extra savings were largely gone, in part to cover higher costs and in part to buy a house amid rising prices. Black households on average had $6,556 dollars less in liquid savings in September 2023 than in December 2019. In comparison, Latino households had roughly the same amount then as they did before the pandemic started, while white households had 13.4% more – or $19,768.\n\nBlack and Latino households are regularly in a much worse position to weather a financial emergency than is the case for white households.\n\nPart of the decline in liquid savings likely came from some households using those funds as down payments for a house amid rising real estate prices. The homeownership rates of all racial and ethnic groups grew during the pandemic, census data show. By the third quarter of 2023, 45.5% of Black households and 49.4% of Latino/Hispanic households owned their own house, while this was the case for 74.5% of white households. These numbers show more widespread homeownership than in 2019, when 44% of Black households, 48.1% of Latino/Hispanic households and 73.7% of white households owned their own home.

    "text": "ByDan Doonan, Contributor. One of the defining challenges of our time is the growing problem of economic inequality in the United States. In 2021, the top ten percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent in 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent dropped correspondingly over that period, while the bottom 50 percent (some 63 million families) owned only about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021. Not only does this economic inequality create hardships for families, experts agree that it is fueling discontent and political polarization in America.   As income and wealth inequality have spiked dramatically during the past forty years, advocates, researchers, and policymakers spanning the ideological spectrum have offered explanations on causes and potential solutions. But one counterweight to increasing inequality that hasn’t received as much attention is defined benefit pension plans. A new report provides a first-of-a-kind analysis on just how important pensions are in reducing wealth inequality.  Closing The GapGPS, jointly issued by the National Institute on Retirement Security and the UC Berkeley Labor Center, examines the role of pensions in providing adequate income to retirees analyzed by race, gender, and educational attainment. It also focuses on the role of pension plans in creating retirement wealth for workers.  Pensions Dramatically Boost Wealth, Especially for Blacks and Latinos The wealth-building effect of pensions is important, but often overlooked. When thinking about households accumulating wealth, it’s typically thought of as owning stocks or a home, but not the value of a retirement plan like a pension. In fact, a retirement plan often is one of the largest financial assets of many households. Thus, it’s important to consider the impact of pensions in closing the wealth gap. The new report finds that including the value of pension income in household wealth boosts the typical (median) net worth of older families substantially– a whopping 36 percent. The power of pensions is even more substantial for older Black families. Pensions increase their median net worth by a staggering 86 percent, with public pensions providing more than half of this impact. And for older Latino families that historically have been underrepresented in the public sector, pension benefits increase their median wealth by 32.4 percent.  While other research has noted that pension plans tend to lessen the degree of inequality in the U.S., this report is the first to assign specific numbers to the large wealth impact of pensions. But the findings come as pensions are on the decline in the private sector, leaving Social Security and public pension plans as the two remaining protectors of retirement security for middle-class families. This is especially true for Black workers, who have found public sector employment to be a pathway to the middle class due to the history of occupational segregation in the U.S. While defined benefit pensions remain common in the public sector, legislative changes in recent years have led to plans with tiers with less generous benefits, the establishment of hybrid plans that include both pension plan and defined contribution (DC) plan components, or a choice between a pension or a DC plan. As the impacts of these changes are more fully felt in future years when more workers begin retiring under these new plans or tiers, the inequality-dampening effects of public pension plans may decline somewhat. In the meantime, the economic impact for today’s retirees is more significant than most people realize, as public and private sector pension benefit payments in 2020 exceeded $600 billion nationwide. Pensions Also Boost Wealth for Women and Those Without a College Degree  Closing the Gap also shows the importance of pension plans for women and those without a four-year college degree. The report finds that public pension income is distributed more equally by gender than private pension and 401(k) income, which reflects different employment patterns by women. In addition, retirees fare better economically with a pension regardless of educational attainment, with the largest improvement among those without bachelor’s degrees.  Closing the Gap uses 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) as a helpful benchmark to assess the poverty-alleviating impact of pensions. And this impact is profound. Across all retirees, a significantly larger share of U.S. retirees with pension income were above 200 percent FPL in 2018-2020 (91%) compared to retirees without pension income (60%). Retired Black women, Latino men, and Black men were twice as likely to have incomes above 200 percent FPL if they had a pension. Those with no college education, but who have a pension, were 73 percent more likely to be above 200 percent of the FPL than those with no college education and no pension. And those pension benefits translate into meaningful retirement income. Those with a high school degree or less, but who had a pension, had $169,000 in pension wealth - significantly more retirement resources than typically seen among this group of workers.  Social Security and pensions, supplemented by 401(k)s and personal savings, supported the retirement security of the American middle class for decades. While these programs continue to provide substantial retirement income for retirees today, they face stiff headwinds. Social Security faces funding challenges, pensions are no longer widely available to private-sector workers, and 401(k) plans are underfunded except for the highest income workers. For most families, 401(k) savings and Social Security just won't provide sufficient retirement income, and the problem is even worse for women, Blacks, Latinos, and those lacking a college degree.  Thanks to this important new analysis, we now have data that for the first time shows the power of pensions for addressing a major economic and political problem facing the U.S. - economic inequality. Clearly, pensions play an outsized role in closing the growing wealth and retirement gap. Perhaps policymakers should place a higher priority on making pensions more widely available to working Americans. Not only would pensions improve working Americans’ financial outlook, but the reduced stress also could play a significant role in addressing the social discontent that is ailing the nation.",

    "text": "ByImperial Business Insights, Contributor. Over the last 50 years we’ve seen a trend. Wealth is growing, there’s no doubt about that. In the year 2000 for instance, Forbes estimated there were just 470 billionaires in the world, owning $898 billion collectively. Fast forward to 2021, and Forbes’ annual rich list named 2,755 billionaires, with the top six collectively earning more than all 470 billionaires from the 2000 list combined.  When you flip the coin however, though wealth is soaring for many, there’s a far larger number of people whose circumstances are getting worse. The cost-of-living crisis, as well as soaring inflation, is causing many people’s real wage to drop significantly. The picture is the same across the pond in Europe too. In the UK, the number of people seeking help to feed themselves and their families through food banks has increased from 26,000 in 2010, to more than 2.56 million in 2022. At the same time, the cumulative wealth of the top ten billionaires in the UK has grown from £48 billion in 2009 to £182 billion in 2022 - an increase of 281 percent. Clearly the gulf between rich and the poor has become much more pronounced. Wealth inequality is a hugely important issue for governments and policymakers, but the current evidence makes long-term country comparisons difficult, and doesn’t help us to clearly understand the reasons behind such stark differences in wealth inequality trajectories.  With my colleague, Thomas Blanchet from the Paris School of Economics, we gathered all the necessary data to build the first Distributional Wealth Accounts for Europe. Our intention was to compare wealth inequality between Europe and the United States over the last five decades.  Having built the database, we started our research by analysing the evolution of aggregate wealth – which is defined as a person’s total assets and investments net of liabilities. We calculated the ratio of each country’s household net wealth to national income. This ratio indicates whether individual countries in Europe and the US are becoming richer or poorer.  We then explored the differences between Europe and the US by focusing on three key drivers of wealth accumulation: differences in savings, wages, and capital gains - of which the profit from property sales forms a key part. So, what were the results? Europe has experienced (slightly) faster growth in aggregate wealth compared to the US  We found the evolution of aggregate household wealth (relative to income) was similar in Europe and the US, steadily increasing from three times the national income in 1970 to five times the national income in the US and six times the national income in Europe in 2018.  The reason why the wealth to income ratio was slightly higher in Europe than in the US is mainly due to a bigger decline in house prices in the US during the global financial crisis.  The evolution of wealth among the wealthiest one percent of the population tells a different story  However, when we analysed the evolution of the top one percent wealth share in each of these regions, we found that, while Europe experienced moderate growth, the growth in the US was significantly higher. In other words, the gap between rich and poor in the US became much more pronounced. This was true whether compared to the European average or any single European country.  How can we explain these differences? To examine the drivers, we ran simulations that substituted the labour income inequality and asset price trajectories from France into the US figures. We found the US wealth concentration levels were lower because of the smaller rise in labour income inequality and the larger rise in house prices relative to financial assets in Europe. This would benefit middle income individuals more, as they have a larger share of housing in their portfolio. The results were similar when we substituted the same figures from other European countries into the US data.  Our research leads us to make three calls to action for policymakers:  1. Job market policies are crucial to reducing wealth inequality  We have shown labour income inequality has been an important factor behind the growing gap between rich and poor in the US. Controlling unemployment and designing policies aimed at boosting wages at the lower end of the market must be a priority if wealth inequality is to be reduced.  2. Central banks must play a key role in stabilising house prices  Since housing is an asset that has a disproportionate impact on middle income individuals, it is important prices are stabilised to prevent financial crises and the rise in wealth disparities.  3. Official institutions need to collect more and better wealth data Our research has made some progress in understanding the differences in wealth inequality trajectories between Europe and the US. We know much less about the evolution of wealth inequalities in the emerging and developing world. To design policies aimed at mitigating the rise of wealth inequalities, we first need to understand the levels and trajectories of wealth disparities within and across countries. If governments do not address the wealth gap with equitable policies and inclusive growth, more people will suffer from rising economic inequality.

I grew up living with my mom and maternal grandparents, while my dad played and coached in the NBA. For a time, our family’s safety net was held together by my grandfather’s HVAC business, but in 2001, it nearly came apart. That year, the company worked on a project performing mechanical-contracting work at Lincoln Financial Field, the home of the Philadelphia Eagles. The timeline did not account for delays. My grandfather estimates that the company lost $4 million on the project. Our house was put on the market shortly after. I loved that house because it felt like home, but also because it made me feel at home in a predominantly white world, where I felt as if my every move was on display. The house served as a symbol of wealth to justify belonging. When we sold it, I felt exposed, as though my family was showcasing the fragility of black wealth for all to see. I told friends that my family wanted to downsize. I’m sure they saw through the lie. Americans are uncomfortable talking about money. We use careers, homes, and clothing to stand in as proxies. Certain markers in these areas signify wealth, regardless of the actual amount in your bank account. I harbor no delusions about how privileged my family and I are. As an adult, I am thankful every day for how much my family sacrificed for my freedom. But I also know that, as a whole, black wealth is delicate, because for generations lawmakers and power wielders attempted to prevent African Americans from building it. When I set out to write this story, I wanted to better understand the intricate narratives that make wealth in the black community so complex. My own understanding was rooted in the idea that while my family represented a version of the American dream, the injustices that have kept black families without a safety net for generations still reverberated throughout our history. I found those historical echoes still ringing in the stories of other families, too. A raft of policies responsible for building the American middle class destroyed opportunities for black people to build intergenerational wealth. According to 2013 data from a paper by the progressive think tank Institute for Policy Studies, if the average wealth held by white families magically stopped growing, it would take 228 years for the average wealth held by African Americans to catch up. When researchers from the institute looked at median wealth from 1983 to 2016 (adjusting for inflation), black families saw their wealth decrease by more than half, while white families saw theirs rise by 33 percent. While white families have a median wealth of $171,000, black families have a median wealth of just $17,600. These relationships aren’t fixed. Once you get a certain amount of wealth, keeping it within your family is much easier. It took until 1976 for the government to introduce the generation-skipping transfer tax, which was instituted to stop individuals from avoiding federal estate taxes by leaving money to their grandchildren. In 2010 (when the estate and generation-skipping taxes were briefly repealed), an estate could again escape paying those taxes on its fortunes. In Donald Trump’s 2019 State of the Union address, he praised himself for raising the estate-tax exemption to $11.2 million, which resulted in, the Tax Policy Center estimates, taxing less than 0.1 percent of estates (or about 1,900 households). America’s tax system protects the wealth that already exists, instead of the wealth that might exist if more families were in a position to build it. That my grandfather built enough wealth to get us into that house but not enough to keep it is partially a result of how much the cards have been stacked against African American wealth-building for generations. When World War II ended, my grandfather was only 6, but the discriminatory distortions of the GI Bill are still visible in our family’s financial history. His father, aunt, and uncles were World War II veterans. Four of them were able to secure coveted government jobs. While this may have given them stability, it did not help them build long-term wealth to pass along. White veterans, however, were encouraged to go to college, where they graduated with degrees in subjects such as engineering, according to research by the journalist Edward Humes. Even though 49 percent of black veterans (compared with 43 percent of white veterans) took advantage of some sort of education or training offered through GI Bill benefits as of 1950, that didn’t always mean a college degree. Most African American veterans who exercised their education benefits after World War II ended up pursuing vocational training, as counselors who approved the benefits steered blacks into low-paying jobs or historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). At the time, HBCUs were underfunded and did not offer engineering programs. Short on space, they were forced to turn away up to 50,000 black veterans. Humes also pointed to a survey of 6,000 job placements in Mississippi during the fall of 1946: 86 percent of the skilled, professional, and semiskilled jobs went to white veterans. My grandfather joined a union in 1956. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Act into law, policy makers drafted it to exclude agricultural and domestic workers, so black people made up less than 1 percent of union members. Black workers continued to struggle for equal treatment in unions: 31 affiliates of the American Federation of Labor explicitly excluded black workers at one point. Membership was nonetheless an important stepping stone for my grandfather. He gained entry only after his grandmother, a maid, persuaded her boss, the entrepreneur Charlie Willard, to hire her grandson. Willard helped him earn union membership and later made my grandfather a crew foreman. He got assigned to run the crew for Pennsylvania Hospital’s first professionally air-conditioned building. As my grandfather tells it, the hospital quickly poached him, offering him a full-time job and eventually promoting him to a position with a salary of $35,000. Eventually my grandfather wanted more than a steady paycheck. Although he may not have thought about it at the time, he wanted to build wealth. So he started a side hustle installing air conditioners for restaurants, bars, and colleges. He branded white trucks with his name and hired a crew to help him fulfill orders while he was at the hospital. When the hospital discovered his other business, his boss gave him an ultimatum: his side hustle or his full-time job. He chose the side hustle. He recalls union companies early on working with their friends to secure low prices from suppliers, blocking him from getting projects. My grandfather’s story is one of success (this year his business turns 50) that also illustrates why black success is used to claim that the playing field in America is more level than it actually is. My grandfather made it, but does his success against all odds mean that it’s okay when everyone else faces those same odds and fails? A black family’s success story is reassuring proof that the system works. If my family could successfully climb upward, the argument goes, then the ones who can’t aren’t trying hard enough. They don’t have enough grit. But successful black people are also treated as extraordinary. Why? Because Americans know the system is broken. Selling our home served as a personal paradigm shift. Whereas before I felt confident of my place in the world and my ability to keep climbing, afterward I felt my risk tolerance crumbling. I began to see my family’s story in the context of a larger history of a system that unfairly advantages white families at the expense of black ones. So I went to college and studied practical subjects instead of pursuing a passion. I landed jobs after college meant to build wealth, instead of pursuing writing or jobs in publishing, industries that privilege the children of wealthy families who can afford to subsidize young workers in low-paying entry-level jobs. My family, despite their struggles, gave me the means to choose differently. Even so, my initial choices highlight the complicated nature of black success: It’s knowing that as you rise, you have a responsibility to make sure your family and community rise with you. For better or worse, American wealth is a family affair. Part of what I struggled with growing up is that my dad’s profession is the archetype of black wealth and success. I remember overhearing a classmate once saying something along the lines of “Rich black people play sports.” This idea about what professional sports means conflicted with the reality of a limited generational safety net. My dad still works in the NBA, coaching for Oklahoma City. He guards his emotions as well as he used to guard other players, and I recently flew there hesitant to have a frank conversation about money and, more specifically, what it was like for him to go from the South Side of Chicago to a world of success. We sat in the living room, his dog, Bailey, lying by his side, the television muted in the background. It was a high-pressure time in the season, and I was nervous that he wouldn’t want to delve into the past. But as he did, I came to understand how inaccurate it is to assume that people deemed worthy as “making it” step into one world while leaving behind their own personal history. Maurice Cheeks grew up in Chicago’s Robert Taylor Homes, once the largest public-housing development in the country; it’s now gone—the last building was torn down in 2007. The development opened in 1962, housing up to 27,000 people despite being planned to hold less than half of that. By 1975, 92 percent of the families relied on government assistance. My grandmother was well known around the building she lived in. She used to belt out my dad’s and uncles’ names to get them to come inside as soon as the streetlights turned on. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros once said, “I don’t know of another place in America where there are 15 shootings and five killings over a weekend.” My dad’s general feeling was that you lived your life as best you could. “It was rough,” my dad told me. “But we didn’t really think about it at the time.” My dad will be the first to say that he did not make it out on his own. His basketball career started because a friend won a basketball scholarship to West Texas State (now West Texas A&M University) and told the coach that he would accept only if the coach also took my dad. (The coach has said that he also recognized my dad’s talent). In 1978, my dad was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with a starting salary of $30,000. Today that income would be worth roughly $123,000, or just less than the mean salary for a pharmacist. My dad was making money, but at a salary that did not go as far as the public perception of professional sports portrays. It was another example, like my maternal grandfather’s story, that “making it” is not the same as freedom through wealth. Read: Why black families struggle to build wealth One cannot talk about closing the wealth gap in any meaningful way without acknowledging that middle- and upper-class black families have lost and are still losing wealth because African Americans were ushered into segregated neighborhoods and denied the same benefits extended to white Americans. As soon as my dad started earning a salary, he sent much of it back to my grandmother, who continued living in the Robert Taylor Homes when he first started playing in the NBA. Research shows that my dad’s experience is typical for black people who have family members in need. The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the world’s longest-running longitudinal household survey, began in 1968 with 18,233 people, and now spans four generations or more. According to data from the 1994 PSID analyzed by Darrick Hamilton from the Ohio State University and Ngina Chiteji, now at New York University, 36 percent of middle-income black families’ parents lived in poverty, compared with 8 percent of middle-income white families’ parents. When Hamilton, Jermaine Toney (a National Science Foundation postdoctoral research fellow at Cornell University), and William A. Darity Jr. analyzed 2013 PSID data, they found that the parents of middle-income black families were more than eight times as likely to face poverty as the parents of middle-income white families. The mean net worth of black grandparents in the sample amounted to $56,713—for white grandparents it was $357,831. Those family ties may add up to an unending drain on the financial resources of anyone who makes it. Hamilton and Chiteji found that family circumstances, in general, are responsible for middle-class black families having 27 percent less wealth than their white counterparts. Hamilton and Darity wrote, “Inheritance, bequests, and in vivo transfer account for more of the racial wealth gap than any other behavioral, demographic, or socioeconomic indicator.” In other words, most people at the top of the wealth ladder are not there because of grit. More likely, the government or a family member helped lift them up—by paying for their education, or giving them a loan, or helping with rent. Wealth doesn’t just add lift. It ensures that when you fall, you land softly. We landed softly because my mom and her parents had something to sell—our house—when my grandfather’s business took a wrong turn. I also had support from my father. But that’s what makes us different. We’re more like the typical upper-income white family than the typical black one. The economist Raj Chetty and three other researchers found that a black child born to parents whose income is in the top quintile has roughly the same likelihood of falling to the bottom quintile as remaining at the top. White children, however, are about five times as likely to stay at the top when born there than they are to drop to the bottom. Those researchers were looking only at the power of income in that part of the study. But it stands to reason that wealth helps, too. A middle-income white family is more likely to be wealthier and own their home than a black family at the same place on the income scale. If you land a plum job at Google or Goldman Sachs, staying affluent will be a lot easier if your parents have already paid off their mortgage than if they’re still writing rent checks in public housing. Critics will argue that people who don’t climb upward when receiving help from welfare programs are taking advantage of the system. Welfare programs, however, are not one size fits all. Each program is intricately woven with the biases of policy makers, and rarely helps families build long-term wealth. As was the case with the Robert Taylor Homes, the site selection itself was designed to maintain segregation: In 1950, the city-council aldermen approved sites only in the “black belt,” instead of on the vacant land in white areas initially proposed by the Chicago Housing Authority. None of this is made easier when your family doesn’t know how to talk about money. Fluency in the language of intergenerational wealth is an advantage passed down along with the money itself. When my dad left the Robert Taylor Homes and started earning a salary, he didn’t know what to do with it. “The accountant came and asked me why I wasn’t cashing my checks,” he told me. “I used to hide my checks under my mattress when I started making more money.” Most Americans cannot expect one job to drastically alter their financial position. The thesis of the American dream is that consistent hard work pays off over time. But what if playing by the rules is still not enough to maintain wealth through multiple generations? What if the rules are stacked against you? I met Wendy Jones in December after learning about her mother, Josephine E. Jones. According to Wendy’s research for her book about her mom’s life story, An Extraordinary Life: Josephine E. Jones, Jo Jones may have been the first black woman in management at a Fortune 500 company. Wendy grew tearfully excited when talking about her mother—the words couldn’t come fast enough. She has meticulous files documenting her mother’s life, which she carefully showed me in the back of a restaurant near her home in New Jersey one late winter afternoon. She wants her mother to be remembered not only for breaking new corporate ground, but as someone who aimed to help her family and her community achieve whatever they wanted—including wealth. When Jo purchased a historic brownstone home in Harlem, her goal was to leave it to Wendy. What she ended up leaving Wendy was money, not wealth—for reasons that have everything to do with why many black Americans still do not feel free in this country. Read: Getting to the bottom of Americans’ fascination with wealth Jo was born in 1920 in South Carolina—her father was a sharecropper. At 26, she traveled north and started working as a cook for wealthy families, often being required to stay past midnight to wash dishes and take care of the families’ children. In 1953, Jo paid $100 a month in rent, which was twice the gross median rent in the New York metro area, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, but the best a black woman with a child could do. In 1951, Jo got a job working for a temp agency supplying cooks and maids to homes and companies. She received a two-week assignment to work for Standard Brands, a packaged-goods company, that ended up lasting 31 years, after the company hired her and eventually promoted her to run the employee cafeteria. When Wendy graduated from college, her mother handed her a folder full of notes from a course on home buying and told her to help them find a permanent place to live. In 1975, Wendy found a listing for 137 West 122nd Street in The New York Times—a house designed by the architect Francis H. Kimball, with original woodwork, stained-glass windows, and five original gas-burning fireplaces. Jo walked through the doors and knew she was home. When she tried to apply for a loan, the loan officer at Citibank (known at the time as First National City Bank) admitted that the bank did not lend mortgages in Harlem. So Jo persuaded the seller to agree to a purchase-money mortgage instead, essentially taking out a loan straight from the seller instead of a bank. Jo even agreed to cover the seller’s property taxes for that quarter after the owner wavered on the decision to sell. All of this took place even after redlining had been officially outlawed in 1968, with the passing of the Fair Housing Act. During redlining, the Federal Housing Administration, which insured private mortgages, considered whether black people lived in a particular neighborhood when making its insurance decisions. In “The Case for Reparations,” Ta-Nehisi Coates writes, “Neither the percentage of black people living there nor their social class mattered.” Black people were denied traditional mortgages. White families bought homes, moved to the suburbs, and gained equity, while black families were largely prevented from increasing their wealth through homeownership. By 1970, black people made up 92.2 percent of central-Harlem residents. Jo established a spring cleaning to rid the neighborhood of debris, and later led a task force to rid the neighborhood of drugs. She fought to register her house—which became part of a historic district—on the National Register of Historic Places in order to secure the only loan she could get. (A spokesman for Citibank said it does not keep records of its lending practices going that far back but is committed to fair lending practices.) Jo’s tenacity brought her many things, but financial security wasn’t one of them. In 1984, Jo alleged she was forced out of her job because of her age. With advice from her former boss (having a person in your corner who is comfortable challenging authority helps), Jo filed a lawsuit against her former employer, which was settled out of court. Jo was also offered only half the severance of employees in other departments.The loan had helped her repair the exterior of the historic house, but the interior was still not yet restored when Jo left her other job, in 1989. When Jo got sick in 2006 she couldn’t safely stay in the house. Her pension from work was half of what she got from Social Security, and was not enough to cover the cost of care. Jo’s job as a cook came with long hours and zero benefits. She was employed for five years as a domestic worker without being eligible for Social Security: When Social Security was created in 1935, agricultural and domestic workers were excluded, causing 65 percent of African Americans to be denied benefits. Social Security encompassed multiple programs, at least some of which were explicitly created to hurt black people. While drafting Title I (a program administered by the state to elderly in need) of the Social Security Act, southern members of Congress “did not want to give authority to anyone in Washington to deny aid to any state because it discriminated against Negroes in the administration of old age assistance,” Edwin Witte, the executive director of Roosevelt’s economic-security committee, wrote in his memoir. Toward the end of her life, Jo had no assets beyond her partially restored home. Wendy sold the home in 2008 after moving her mother to New Jersey, closer to where Wendy lived with her partner and son. Wendy and Jo split the proceeds from the sale, with half going toward Jo’s medical and assisted-living bills, Wendy told me. Then, Wendy’s partner lost his job, and her half of the house money was almost all they had left to live on. “Even when you get a windfall, it’s not like you can invest it, because you have to make sure everything doesn’t fall apart on your day-to-day life,” Wendy said. Wendy’s windfall—half of the $1.4 million the house sold for—was more than most families, black or white, will receive at any one point in their lifetime. The more telling number, though, is what Wendy chose to give up. When I asked Wendy for details of the sale, she unveiled a striking detail: Despite the house being in what is now one of the most desirable markets for Manhattan’s single-family homes, Wendy chose not to list 137 West 122nd Street on the open market. As her mother’s legal guardian, Wendy knew that Jo would have wanted a black family to own the home, and Jo’s neighbors had offered to pay the appraisal price. For high-priced New York real-estate assets, a seller may get significantly more than the appraisal price on the open market. Wendy’s decision is not surprising to me: Because homeownership was denied to many black families for decades, something larger than money is at stake when it comes to selling a home. Jo’s lifelong quest was to build up the black community around her; letting the market decide the next occupant of the home would have been to put the power back into the hands of the invisible policy makers whose legacy of redlining had left her without a mortgage in 1975. Wendy’s decision was characteristic of black philanthropy in general: tangible, specific, and focused on immediate impact. Philanthropy in the black community has a long history of building wealth for the group at the expense of the individual, even if that doesn’t maximize one’s tax advantages. Starting in 1969, in a memorable example, members of the Black Panther Party fed thousands of children free breakfast before school, hoping to keep kids full so that their minds were free to learn. The program helped form the basis of a federal food program in schools. Instead of tax breaks, members of the party were beaten and killed. A more congenial example comes from David Bennett, the vice president of development and alumni relations at Howard University in Washington, D.C., one of the nation’s HBCUs. The Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, recently donated $100,000 to the school, he told me. In order to donate the money, churchgoers gave up eating out, buying coffee, and going to the movies for 21 days. The funds, Bennett said, helped 34 students, who otherwise wouldn’t have been able to afford tuition, graduate. HBCUs continue to carry a heavy burden to educate the black community: Howard graduates more African American students who go on to pursue science and engineering doctorates than Harvard, MIT, and Yale combined. Yet, according to a Wall Street Journal report analyzing 2017 data, HBCU graduates have a median debt that’s more than 30 percent higher than that of graduates at other public and nonprofit four-year schools. Parents of HBCU students borrowed an average of roughly $14,000 in federal student loans to help pay for the 2017–18 academic year. The neighbors to whom Wendy sold the house kept it for 10 years, but, she said, weren’t able to make the necessary renovations to rent it out. Wendy sees the house as an effort geared toward building intergenerational wealth. “Now, at least, the family has the funds for the education of their young people,” Wendy emailed me. “So, indirectly, my mother helped another black family have wealth to pass on, and their children will go on to do good in the world and help others.” The house sold in 2018 for $2.2 million. Derrick Darby is the first and only black tenured professor in the University of Michigan’s philosophy department. I first learned of Darby after reading a profile of his department chair, Elizabeth Anderson, in The New Yorker. Anderson is known for arriving at moral theory by thinking about how the world actually works. She said Darby was recruited to Michigan because his work fits that mold, allowing people to connect normative issues with the realities of contemporary injustice. I went to Ann Arbor to talk with Darby about the practical realities of policy proposals such as reparations or a wealth tax. What I found was evidence of why Darby is very much the exception, rather than the rule, in the false meritocracy of a nation founded by slaveholders. Darby’s journey is rife with the often overlooked details of everyday life that shape the nuances of wealth in America. Darby grew up in New York City’s Queensbridge Houses, a public-housing development that is now the largest in the country. It has birthed some of the greatest hip-hop artists of our time, such as Nas and Mobb Deep. Success for Darby was never about a number in his bank account. It was about getting out of the projects. When Darby was growing up, he dreamed of escape. “I used to think about being a superhero, because that was going to be my way out,” he told me. “I’d get some superpowers and I could be strong … I could help my mother.” Darby talked about trying out different exit routes. Basketball? No, he wasn’t going to be in the NBA. Boxing? He got punched, instantly had a splitting headache, took off his gloves, and walked away. But Darby was inquisitive; he hung out with older kids and a group of ex-convicts in the neighborhood. They used to call him “Little Socrates.” It was the ex-convicts, people Darby looked up to because they made it clear that their path was not the only path, who told him to focus on knowledge as a means of escape. He just as easily, however, could have absorbed another message. Despite being labeled by a teacher as a good student in the third grade, Darby was suddenly considered a problem in the fourth. Darby remembers changing his little sister’s diapers before going to school. The cycle of being saddled with child-care responsibilities and being punished for not doing well in school took its toll, and he struggled to stay focused on his education. Making it past fourth grade proved crucial: Subsequent teachers reinforced his third-grade teacher’s message and invested in Darby, buoying his path through high school and, along with a guidance counselor, helping him with college applications until he was accepted to Colgate University. Once at Colgate, his philosophy professor latched onto his talent and encouraged him to pursue his doctorate. When Darby talked about policies such as universal child care, he said they’re not just about helping parents. Policies such as that would help alleviate the responsibilities that can fall on children when families are strapped for resources. Academia still plays mostly by the old rule books. Scholars are comfortable citing traditionalists. Try asking “What is injustice?” instead of “What is justice?” in philosophy, Darby said, and you’re viewed as breaking from custom. Philosophy represents the type of discipline where the system may still not be built to accommodate the diversity it claims to want. “On the one hand, because of the recent push for diversity in the discipline black philosophers are novelties; yet on the other hand, their race threatens the white male homogeneity that has traditionally characterized the discipline,” writes Jameliah Shorter-Bourhanou, an assistant professor of philosophy at Georgia College. Quayshawn Spencer, a philosophy professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says that 66 percent of tenured or tenure-track black philosophers are the only black philosophers in their department, according to 2013 data. Michigan will soon go back to having zero tenured black professors: Darby has accepted an offer from Rutgers University to be the Henry Rutgers Professor of Philosophy and direct the soon-to-be-created Social Justice Solutions Research Collaboratory. Philosophers are known more as thinkers than as earners. With Darby’s new position, however, the two may coincide: He will be joining one of the top philosophy departments in the country. Darby’s trajectory may not have begun with the explicit goal of building monetary wealth. Rather, it was important for him to do what he loved and build wealth along the way. Both of those opportunities were nearly taken from him when he was up for tenure at another university. Darby showed me a letter from a colleague in the philosophy department, detailing why the university should deny Darby tenure. (I reached out several times to the professor who wrote the letter for comment, but did not receive a response. The university declined to comment.) The letter questioned his ability to teach graduate students and suggested that many scholars who reviewed his research were biased. “It was an attack on me,” Darby said. He believes the letter partially meant to suggest that any support he had within the university and beyond was driven by racial sympathy, instead of the strength of his ideas. The professor titled it “Department Minority Report,” a typical name for a dissenting document that goes against the committee’s majority vote, but perhaps a cruel reminder when you are one of the few people of color among your colleagues. At the end of the review process, Darby was denied tenure. Darby filed an appeal and later learned the contents of the letter. He also hired a lawyer out of his own pocket, no small thing on his entry-level academic salary. A ruling conceded that there had been “unusual procedures” and offered Darby another chance to be reviewed. But Darby declined, and instead accepted a position elsewhere. “At the time, it was really difficult, knowing that they changed the rules,” Darby told me. “You climb this ladder—but then, when we start climbing that ladder and we get into those spaces, the rules change.” Darby knows that he is one of the lucky ones. He could see how someone who had not been in a position to challenge the tenure ruling may have ended up leaving philosophy altogether. For Darby, the system eventually worked. For others, without the right network or funds, it fails them. There is a supposed right way to be black in America: You’re encouraged to live in certain neighborhoods; you must make certain sacrifices for the sake of education. When I was younger, I railed against these constraints. Money only complicated the picture. In time, I came to understand that the image money creates stands in for all the things we don’t say about who gets to be free. As a child, I found refuge in my house and all it stood for. As an adult, I understand how much of my family history was wrapped up in that simple feeling. Even the black families who make it to the top are still facing the headwinds that knocked African Americans back down the path for so long. While the Americans who self-identify as “middle class” but hold the majority of the wealth in the United States—“the 9.9 percent,” in Matthew Stewart’s memorable phrase—debate private versus public school or whether to remodel their kitchen, upwardly mobile black families continue to overcome a history of oppression with their eyes toward wealth as a reconciliation of the freedom long denied. “Making it” is not merely an end point. It is so much more than that. Wealth has become an animating issue in the 2020 presidential election. Take Senator Elizabeth Warren’s proposal for a wealth tax. Under Warren’s plan, according to an analysis by the UC Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the wealthiest 75,000 households in the United States would be subject to payments of 2 percent of their net worth above $50 million and 3 percent of their net worth above $1 billion every year. Warren says the resulting revenue would be enough to cover her proposal to cancel student-loan debt for 42 million Americans and provide a free public-college education. (She would also provide funding for HBCUs.) The wealth tax represents a step toward federal recognition that people don’t succeed on their own. But her proposal, and those like it, hint at the symptoms, not the cause. They do not address the fact that once you graduate from college and land a job, your wealth is still in the hands of others (your boss or even a colleague, as the case may be). Or that if you don’t wish to go to college and instead want to pursue a bold business idea, your freedom to do so depends on your parents’ ability to support you. This means different things for black and white Americans. Put another way: Believe for a moment that the world’s Googles and Amazons had been invented in garages, as their founding myths assert. Would companies like that exist if failure meant living in the projects instead of a middle-class garage? What we need is a formal reconciliation with the way wealth is built and maintained. To put the freedom of choice created through wealth back into the hands of the people who have had that freedom denied to them for far too long. How do we do that? I’m not sure there’s an easy answer. Read: The racial wealth gap could become a 2020 litmus test Arguably the most important act of reconciliation took place at a college graduation in Atlanta this spring. Robert F. Smith, an investor and the wealthiest black person in the United States, said he would pay off the student-loan debt of the graduating class at Morehouse College, an HBCU. Smith told the graduates, “True wealth comes from contributing to the liberation of people, and the liberation of communities we come from depends upon the grit and the determination and the greatness inside of you.” What struck me about Smith’s gift, compared with other philanthropic efforts or policy arguments, was this: He put the power of choice back into the graduates’ hands by acknowledging the shared history of African Americans. I grew up with the freedom to choose because my family overcame incredible odds. In fact, maybe I have that freedom only because they dared not to follow a conventional path. It is this friction that was difficult for me to come to terms with: The right to pursue a passion and build wealth seems to be reserved for a select few. Maybe no one has the right to do both. But you’re less likely to have to choose if the generation that came before you was wealthy, and less likely still if that generation was white. Closing the wealth gap sounds like an abstract policy agenda, but it’s really about giving more people the power to choose how to care for themselves and their families. The individuals I spoke with know this responsibility intimately. But black wealth is not separate from American wealth—it is the definition of American wealth. Everyone who shares in this country’s wealth also has the responsibility to lift others up. There is no such thing as an individual success story. * Photo-collage images courtesy of Maura Cheeks, Wendy Jones, Derrick Darby, John Swart / Beth A. Keiser / SJP / AP.

    "onlytext": "Wealth is a number, sure, but it’s also a feeling. I grew up living with my mom and maternal grandparents, while my dad played and coached in the NBA. For a time, our family’s safety net was held together by my grandfather’s HVAC business, but in 2001, it nearly came apart. That year, the company worked on a project performing mechanical-contracting work at Lincoln Financial Field, the home of the Philadelphia Eagles. The timeline did not account for delays. My grandfather estimates that the company lost $4 million on the project. Our house was put on the market shortly after. I loved that house because it felt like home, but also because it made me feel at home in a predominantly white world, where I felt as if my every move was on display. The house served as a symbol of wealth to justify belonging. When we sold it, I felt exposed, as though my family was showcasing the fragility of black wealth for all to see.\n\nWhen we sold it, I felt exposed, as though my family was showcasing the fragility of black wealth for all to see. I told friends that my family wanted to downsize. I’m sure they saw through the lie. Americans are uncomfortable talking about money. We use careers, homes, and clothing to stand in as proxies. Certain markers in these areas signify wealth, regardless of the actual amount in your bank account.\n\nI harbor no delusions about how privileged my family and I are. As an adult, I am thankful every day for how much my family sacrificed for my freedom. But I also know that, as a whole, black wealth is delicate, because for generations lawmakers and power wielders attempted to prevent African Americans from building it.\n\nWhen I set out to write this story, I wanted to better understand the intricate narratives that make wealth in the black community so complex. My own understanding was rooted in the idea that while my family represented a version of the American dream, the injustices that have kept black families without a safety net for generations still reverberated throughout our history.\n\nA raft of policies responsible for building the American middle class destroyed opportunities for black people to build intergenerational wealth. According to 2013 data from a paper by the progressive think tank Institute for Policy Studies, if the average wealth held by white families magically stopped growing, it would take 228 years for the average wealth held by African Americans to catch up. When researchers from the institute looked at median wealth from 1983 to 2016 (adjusting for inflation), black families saw their wealth decrease by more than half, while white families saw theirs rise by 33 percent. While white families have a median wealth of $171,000, black families have a median wealth of just $17,600.\n\nThese relationships aren’t fixed. Once you get a certain amount of wealth, keeping it within your family is much easier. It took until 1976 for the government to introduce the generation-skipping transfer tax, which was instituted to stop individuals from avoiding federal estate taxes by leaving money to their grandchildren. \n\nAmerica’s tax system protects the wealth that already exists, instead of the wealth that might exist if more families were in a position to build it. That my grandfather built enough wealth to get us into that house but not enough to keep it is partially a result of how much the cards have been stacked against African American wealth-building for generations.\n\nWhen World War II ended, my grandfather was only 6, but the discriminatory distortions of the GI Bill are still visible in our family’s financial history. His father, aunt, and uncles were World War II veterans. Four of them were able to secure coveted government jobs. \n\nWhite veterans, however, were encouraged to go to college, where they graduated with degrees in subjects such as engineering. Even though 49 percent of black veterans (compared with 43 percent of white veterans) took advantage of some sort of education or training offered through GI Bill benefits as of 1950, that didn’t always mean a college degree.\n\nMy grandfather joined a union in 1956. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Act into law, policy makers drafted it to exclude agricultural and domestic workers, so black people made up less than 1 percent of union members. Black workers continued to struggle for equal treatment in unions: 31 affiliates of the American Federation of Labor explicitly excluded black workers at one point.\n\nMembership was nonetheless an important stepping stone for my grandfather. He gained entry only after his grandmother, a maid, persuaded her boss, the entrepreneur Charlie Willard, to hire her grandson. \n\nHe got assigned to run the crew for Pennsylvania Hospital’s first professionally air-conditioned building. As my grandfather tells it, the hospital quickly poached him, offering him a full-time job and eventually promoting him to a position with a salary of $35,000. Eventually my grandfather wanted more than a steady paycheck.\n\nAlthough he may not have thought about it at the time, he wanted to build wealth. So he started a side hustle installing air conditioners for restaurants, bars, and colleges. He branded white trucks with his name and hired a crew to help him fulfill orders while he was at the hospital.\n\nWhen the hospital discovered his other business, his boss gave him an ultimatum: his side hustle or his full-time job. He chose the side hustle. He recalls union companies early on working with their friends to secure low prices from suppliers, blocking him from getting projects.\n\nMy grandfather’s story is one of success (this year his business turns 50) that also illustrates why black success is used to claim that the playing field in America is more level than it actually is. My grandfather made it, but does his success against all odds mean that it’s okay when everyone else faces those same odds and fails?\n\nSelling our home served as a personal paradigm shift. Whereas before I felt confident of my place in the world and my ability to keep climbing, afterward I felt my risk tolerance crumbling. I began to see my family’s story in the context of a larger history of a system that unfairly advantages white families at the expense of black ones.\n\nSo I went to college and studied practical subjects instead of pursuing a passion. I landed jobs after college meant to build wealth, instead of pursuing writing or jobs in publishing, industries that privilege the children of wealthy families who can afford to subsidize young workers in low-paying entry-level jobs.\n\nMy family, despite their struggles, gave me the means to choose differently. Even so, my initial choices highlight the complicated nature of black success: It’s knowing that as you rise, you have a responsibility to make sure your family and community rise with you.\n\nFor better or worse, American wealth is a family affair. Part of what I struggled with growing up is that my dad’s profession is the archetype of black wealth and success. \n\nI remember overhearing a classmate once saying something along the lines of “Rich black people play sports.” This idea about what professional sports means conflicted with the reality of a limited generational safety net.\n\nMy dad still works in the NBA, coaching for Oklahoma City. He guards his emotions as well as he used to guard other players, and I recently flew there hesitant to have a frank conversation about money and, more specifically, what it was like for him to go from the South Side of Chicago to a world of success.\n\nWe sat in the living room, his dog, Bailey, lying by his side, the television muted in the background. It was a high-pressure time in the season, and I was nervous that he wouldn’t want to delve into the past.\n\nBut as he did, I came to understand how inaccurate it is to assume that people deemed worthy as “making it” step into one world while leaving behind their own personal history.\n\nMaurice Cheeks grew up in Chicago’s Robert Taylor Homes, once the largest public-housing development in the country; it’s now gone—the last building was torn down in 2007.\n\nThe development opened in 1962, housing up to 27,000 people despite being planned to hold less than half of that. By 1975, 92 percent of the families relied on government assistance.\n\nMy dad’s general feeling was that you lived your life as best you could. “It was rough,” my dad told me. “But we didn’t really think about it at the time.”\n\nMy dad will be the first to say that he did not make it out on his own. His basketball career started because a friend won a basketball scholarship to West Texas State (now West Texas A&M University) and told the coach that he would accept only if the coach also took my dad.\n\nIn 1978, my dad was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with a starting salary of $30,000. Today that income would be worth roughly $123,000, or just less than the mean salary for a pharmacist.\n\nMy dad was making money, but at a salary that did not go as far as the public perception of professional sports portrays.\n\nOne cannot talk about closing the wealth gap in any meaningful way without acknowledging that middle- and upper-class black families have lost and are still losing wealth because African Americans were ushered into segregated neighborhoods and denied the same benefits extended to white Americans.\n\nAs soon as my dad started earning a salary, he sent much of it back to my grandmother, who continued living in the Robert Taylor Homes when he first started playing in the NBA.\n\nResearch shows that my dad’s experience is typical for black people who have family members in need.\n\nThe Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the world’s longest-running longitudinal household survey, began in 1968 with 18,233 people, and now spans four generations or more.\n\nAccording to data from the 1994 PSID analyzed by Darrick Hamilton from the Ohio State University and Ngina Chiteji, now at New York University, 36 percent of middle-income black families’ parents lived in poverty, compared with 8 percent of middle-income white families’ parents.\n\nWhen Hamilton, Jermaine Toney (a National Science Foundation postdoctoral research fellow at Cornell University), and William A. Darity Jr. analyzed 2013 PSID data, they found that the parents of middle-income black families were more than eight times as likely to face poverty as the parents of middle-income white families.\n\nThe mean net worth of black grandparents in the sample amounted to $56,713—for white grandparents it was $357,831.\n\nThose family ties may add up to an unending drain on the financial resources of anyone who makes it.\n\nHamilton and Chiteji found that family circumstances, in general, are responsible for middle-class black families having 27 percent less wealth than their white counterparts.\n\nHamilton and Darity wrote, “Inheritance, bequests, and in vivo transfer account for more of the racial wealth gap than any other behavioral, demographic, or socioeconomic indicator.”\n\nIn other words, most people at the top of the wealth ladder are not there because of grit. More likely, the government or a family member helped lift them up—by paying for their education, or giving them a loan, or helping with rent.\n\nWealth doesn’t just add lift. It ensures that when you fall, you land softly.\n\nThe economist Raj Chetty and three other researchers found that a black child born to parents whose income is in the top quintile has roughly the same likelihood of falling to the bottom quintile as remaining at the top. White children, however, are about five times as likely to stay at the top when born there than they are to drop to the bottom.\n\nCritics will argue that people who don’t climb upward when receiving help from welfare programs are taking advantage of the system. Welfare programs, however, are not one size fits all. Each program is intricately woven with the biases of policy makers, and rarely helps families build long-term wealth.\n\nWendy Jones’s mother, Josephine E. Jones, may have been the first black woman in management at a Fortune 500 company. \n\nJo established a spring cleaning to rid the neighborhood of debris, and later led a task force to rid the neighborhood of drugs. She fought to register her house—which became part of a historic district—on the National Register of Historic Places in order to secure the only loan she could get.\n\nJo’s tenacity brought her many things, but financial security wasn’t one of them. In 1984, Jo alleged she was forced out of her job because of her age. With advice from her former boss (having a person in your corner who is comfortable challenging authority helps), Jo filed a lawsuit against her former employer, which was settled out of court.\n\nJo was also offered only half the severance of employees in other departments.\n\nThe loan had helped her repair the exterior of the historic house, but the interior was still not yet restored when Jo left her other job, in 1989.\n\nWhen Jo got sick in 2006 she couldn’t safely stay in the house. Her pension from work was half of what she got from Social Security, and was not enough to cover the cost of care.\n\nJo’s job as a cook came with long hours and zero benefits. She was employed for five years as a domestic worker without being eligible for Social Security: When Social Security was created in 1935, agricultural and domestic workers were excluded, causing 65 percent of African Americans to be denied benefits.\n\nWendy sold the home in 2008 after moving her mother to New Jersey, closer to where Wendy lived with her partner and son. Wendy and Jo split the proceeds from the sale, with half going toward Jo’s medical and assisted-living bills.\n\nWendy’s decision is not surprising to me: Because homeownership was denied to many black families for decades, something larger than money is at stake when it comes to selling a home.\n\nPhilanthropy in the black community has a long history of building wealth for the group at the expense of the individual, even if that doesn’t maximize one’s tax advantages.\n\nStarting in 1969, in a memorable example, members of the Black Panther Party fed thousands of children free breakfast before school, hoping to keep kids full so that their minds were free to learn.\n\nThe Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, recently donated $100,000 to the school, he told me. In order to donate the money, churchgoers gave up eating out, buying coffee, and going to the movies for 21 days.\n\nDerrick Darby grew up in New York City’s Queensbridge Houses, a public-housing development that is now the largest in the country.\n\nSuccess for Darby was never about a number in his bank account. It was about getting out of the projects.\n\nDarby talked about trying out different exit routes. Basketball? No, he wasn’t going to be in the NBA. Boxing? He got punched, instantly had a splitting headache, took off his gloves, and walked away.\n\nBut Darby was inquisitive; he hung out with older kids and a group of ex-convicts in the neighborhood. They used to call him “Little Socrates.”\n\nDespite being labeled by a teacher as a good student in the third grade, Darby was suddenly considered a problem in the fourth.\n\nMaking it past fourth grade proved crucial: Subsequent teachers reinforced his third-grade teacher’s message and invested in Darby, buoying his path through high school and, along with a guidance counselor, helping him with college applications until he was accepted to Colgate University.\n\nOnce at Colgate, his philosophy professor latched onto his talent and encouraged him to pursue his doctorate.\n\nWhen Darby talked about policies such as universal child care, he said they’re not just about helping parents. Policies such as that would help alleviate the responsibilities that can fall on children when families are strapped for resources.\n\nAcademia still plays mostly by the old rule books. Scholars are comfortable citing traditionalists. Try asking “What is injustice?” instead of “What is justice?” in philosophy, \n\nPhilosophers are known more as thinkers than as earners. With Darby’s new position, however, the two may coincide: He will be joining one of the top philosophy departments in the country.\n\nWealth has become an animating issue in the 2020 presidential election. Take Senator Elizabeth Warren’s proposal for a wealth tax.\n\nThe wealth tax represents a step toward federal recognition that people don’t succeed on their own.\n\nWhat we need is a formal reconciliation with the way wealth is built and maintained. To put the freedom of choice created through wealth back into the hands of the people who have had that freedom denied to them for far too long.\n\nArguably the most important act of reconciliation took place at a college graduation in Atlanta this spring. Robert F. Smith, an investor and the wealthiest black person in the United States, said he would pay off the student-loan debt of the graduating class at Morehouse College, an HBCU.\n\nSmith told the graduates, “True wealth comes from contributing to the liberation of people, and the liberation of communities we come from depends upon the grit and the determination and the greatness inside of you.”\n\nClosing the wealth gap sounds like an abstract policy agenda, but it’s really about giving more people the power to choose how to care for themselves and their families.\n\nThe individuals I spoke with know this responsibility intimately. But black wealth is not separate from American wealth—it is the definition of American wealth. Everyone who shares in this country’s wealth also has the responsibility to lift others up. There is no such thing as an individual success story.",

    "text": "  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time ORLANDO, Fla. — The gap between the haves and have-nots in the United States grew last year to its highest level in more than 50 years of tracking income inequality, according to Census Bureau figures. Income inequality in the United States expanded from 2017 to 2018, with several heartland states among the leaders of the increase, even though several wealthy coastal states still had the most inequality overall, according to figures released Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau. The nation's Gini Index, which measures income inequality, has been rising steadily over the past five decades. The Gini Index grew from 0.482 in 2017 to 0.485 last year, according to the bureau's 1-year American Community Survey data. The Gini Index is on a scale of 0 to 1; a score of \"0'' indicates perfect equality, while a score of \"1'' indicates perfect inequality, where one household has all the income. The increase in income inequality comes as two Democratic presidential candidates, U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, are pitching a \"wealth tax\" on the nation's richest citizens as a way to reduce wealth disparities. The inequality expansion last year took place at the same time median household income nationwide increased to almost $62,000 last year, the highest ever measured by the American Community Survey. But the 0.8% income increase from 2017 to 2018 was much smaller compared to increases in the previous three years, according to the bureau. Even though household income increased, it was distributed unevenly, with the wealthiest helped out possibly by a tax cut passed by Congress in 2017, said Hector Sandoval, an economist at the University of Florida. \"In 2018 the unemployment rate was already low, and the labor market was getting tight, resulting in higher wages. This can explain the increase in the median household income,\" Sandoval said. \"However, the increase in the Gini index shows that the distribution became more unequal. That is, top income earners got even larger increases in their income, and one of the reasons for that might well be the tax cut.\" A big factor in the increase in inequality has to do with two large population groups on either end of the economic spectrum, according to Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida. On one side, at the peak of their earnings, are baby boomers who are nearing retirement, if they haven't already retired. On the other side are millennials and Gen Z-ers, who are in the early stages of their work life and have lower salaries, Snaith said. \"I would say probably the biggest factor is demographics,\" he said. \"A wealth tax isn't going to fix demographics.\" The area's with the most income inequality last year were coastal places with large amounts of wealth — the District of Columbia, New York and Connecticut, as well as areas with great poverty — Puerto Rico and Louisiana. Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota had the most economic equality. Three of the states with biggest gains in inequality from 2017 to 2018 were places with large pockets of wealth — California, Texas and Virginia. But the other six states were primarily in the heartland — Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire and New Mexico. A variety of factors were at play, from a slowdown in agricultural trade and manufacturing to wages that haven't caught up with other forms of income, economists say. While some states have raised the minimum wage, other states like Kansas haven't. At the same time, the sustained economic growth from the recession a decade ago has enriched people who own stocks, property and other assets, and have sources of income other than wages, said Donna Ginther, an economist at the University of Kansas. \"We've had a period of sustained economic growth, and there are winners and losers. The winners tend to be at the top,\" Ginther said. \"Even though we are at full employment, wages really haven't gone up much in the recovery.\" © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC",

    "text": "November 1, 2018 12 min read How Economic Inequality Inflicts Real Biological Harm The growing gulf between rich and poor inflicts biological damage on bodies and brains By Robert M. Sapolsky  Andrea Ucini Western cultures have long cherished the notion that all people are created equal. But in the real world, our lives are not balanced with equal opportunities and resources. This distinction was noted mordantly in 1894 by author Anatole France, who wrote that “the law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.” The rich, of course, need none of these things, whereas the poor often have little choice. And economic disparity has only gotten worse during the past several decades, particularly in the U.S. In 1976 the richest 1 percent of U.S. citizens owned 9 percent of the country’s wealth; today they own about 30 percent. This trend echoes around the globe. One of the consequences for the growing poor is worsening health, and the reasons are not as obvious as you might think. Yes, lower socioeconomic status (SES) means less access to health care and living in more disease-prone neighborhoods. And, yes, as the SES ladder’s lower rungs have become more populated, the number of people with medical problems has climbed. This is not merely an issue of poor health for the poor and some version of better health for everyone else. Starting with Elon Musk at the top, every step down the ladder is associated with worse health. The link between socioeconomic inequality and poor health goes beyond simple access to care and living with more dangers. Fewer than half of the health changes along this SES/health ladder can be explained away by risks such as smoking, alcohol consumption and reliance on fast food or by protective factors such as insurance and health club memberships. In the U.K., large, long-term studies of risks in specific groups, led by epidemiologist Michael Marmot and called the Whitehall studies, demonstrated this clearly. Further, this ladder, or gradient, exists in nations with universal health care; if care availability were truly responsible, universal access should make the gradient vanish. Something else, something quite powerful, must be associated with inequities and be able to cause health problems.

That factor seems to be the stressful psychosocial consequences of low SES. Psychologist Nancy Adler of the University of California, San Francisco, and her colleagues have demonstrated that how people rate how they are doing, relative to others, is at least as predictive of health or illness as are any objective measures such as actual income level. The research indicates that poor health is as much about feeling poor as being poor. Epidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett of the University of Nottingham and the University of York in England, respectively, have filled out this picture in detail, showing that while poverty is bad for your health, poverty amid plenty—inequality—can be worse by just about any measure: infant mortality, overall life expectancy, obesity, murder rates, and more. Health is particularly corroded by your nose constantly being rubbed in what you do not have. Basically, more unequal societies have worse quality of life. Across countries and among U.S. states, more inequality, independent of absolute levels of income, predicts higher rates of crime, including homicide, and higher incarceration rates. Add in higher rates of kids being bullied at schools, more teen pregnancies and lower literacy. There are more psychiatric problems, alcoholism and drug use, as well as lower levels of happiness and less social mobility. And there is less social support—a steep hierarchy is the antithesis of the equality and symmetry that nourish friendship. This grim collective picture helps to explain the immensely important fact that when inequality increases, everyone’s health suffers. This is where the problem affects the rich, the haves, as well as the have-nots. With increasing inequality, they typically expend more resources insulating themselves from the world underneath the bridges. I have heard economist Robert Evans of the University of British Columbia call this the “secession of the wealthy.” They spend more of their own resources on gated communities, private schools, bottled water and expensive organic food. And they give lots of money to politicians who help them maintain their status. It is stressful to construct thick walls to keep everything stressful out. Knowing that these psychological and social factors influence the biology of disease is one thing. Demonstrating just how these stressors do their dirty work inside the body is something else. How do SES and inequality “get under the skin”? It turns out that researchers have made significant strides toward an answer. We have learned a lot about how poverty affects biology, and the part of the growing inequality gap that worries people is the poverty end. Scientists have been able to trace physiological connections from external inequality to three key inner areas: chronic inflammation, chromosomal aging and brain function. Thinking about the biology of disease was revolutionized in the 1990s, when the late Bruce McEwen of the Rockefeller University introduced the concept of allostatic load. Our bodies are constantly challenged by our environment, and we stay healthy when we meet those challenges and return to a baseline state, or homeostasis. Traditionally this view led scientists to focus on specific organs that solve specific challenges. Allostasis has a different perspective: physiological challenges provoke far-flung adaptations throughout the body. An infected toe, for instance, will produce not only inflammation at the tip of the foot but also wider changes in everything from energy taken from abdominal fat to the brain chemistry of sleepiness. As this biological grind continues, it leads to an array of body parts functioning less than optimally, which can be as damaging to health as a single organ gone very wrong. Teresa Seeman of the University of California, Los Angeles, took this idea and followed it through the body, measuring various biomarkers of wear and tear, including increases in blood pressure, cholesterol, blood lipids, body mass index, molecular indicators of chronic hyperglycemia, and levels of stress hormones. She showed that this group of disparate measures powerfully predicts physical health and mortality. Recent research by Seeman and others links low SES with heavy allostatic load because the body is in a constant and futile battle to return to a normal, nonstressed state. These findings highlight an important theme: whereas an adult’s SES predicts allostatic wear and tear, childhood SES leaves a stronger lifelong mark. Low SES predisposes youngsters’ bodies toward earlier “aging.” The scientists also found protective factors. Although growing up in an impoverished neighborhood worsens the low SES–allostatic load link, lucking out with a mother who has the time and energy to be highly nurturing reduces the ill effects. Credit: Bryan Christie Design Stress in any form can produce these effects. It does not have to be related to money, but it is usually related to social situations. My own work with baboons living freely on the East African savanna has shown this effect. In baboon groups, an animal’s place in the social hierarchy produces more or less stress. If you are a low-ranking baboon—a socially stressful situation—your body has unhealthy abnormalities in its secretion of glucocorticoids, which are stress hormones such as cortisol. The body also shows unhealthy changes in the gonadal, cardiovascular and immune systems. In animal and human hierarchies, these stress-induced changes affect health through a key process: chronic inflammation. Few things are better examples of a double-edged biological sword than inflammation. After tissue injury, inflammation contains damage and initiates cell repair. Chronic widespread inflammation, however, causes molecular damage throughout the body, and studies have demonstrated that it contributes to diseases ranging from atherosclerosis to Alzheimer’s. Recent work (including my own focusing on inflammation of the nervous system) indicates that chronic high stress levels can promote chronic inflammation. In people, childhood poverty upregulates the adult body’s proinflammatory set point, with increased expression of inflammatory genes and increased levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, which is associated with a higher risk of heart attacks. These are long-term effects: more financial losses in the Great Recession predict higher C-reactive protein levels six years later. Humans share such vulnerabilities with other primates that live in unequal circumstances. Work by Jenny Tung of Duke University shows more markers of chronic inflammation in low-ranking rhesus monkeys compared with the socially dominant animals in a group. Such studies highlight the directness of the link between social stress factors and unhealthy biology because that link occurs in a species that lacks changes in lifestyle risk factors, such as increased rates of smoking and drinking, that we often see in humans who are stuck in low-status situations. Progress in understanding the routes into the body taken by the SES/health gradient has also come through a very sensitive measure of aging: the condition of telomeres, which are the stretches of DNA at the very tips of chromosomes. Telomeres help to keep our chromosomes stable—molecular biologists like to say that they resemble the plastic caps at the ends of shoelaces that prevent fraying. Every time chromosomes are duplicated for cell division, the telomeres shorten; when they get too short, cells can no longer divide, and they lose many of their healthy functions. Telomere shortening is countered by the enzyme telomerase, which rebuilds these tips. Thus, the state of a cell’s telomeres tells much about its biological “age,” and shortened telomeres that produce frayed, vulnerable chromosomes seem to be a molecular version of wear and tear. Telomere biology met stress physiology in a 2004 study led by health psychologist Elissa Epel and molecular biologist Elizabeth Blackburn, then both at U.C.S.F.; Blackburn won a Nobel Prize in 2009 for her pioneering work on telomeres. They examined 39 people who lived with severe stress every day: women who were caregivers for chronically ill children. The landmark finding was that white blood cells in these caregivers had shortened telomeres, decreased telomerase activity, and elevated oxidative damage to proteins and enzymes. (Oxidation can disable telomerase.) The longer a child’s illness, the more stress the women reported and the shorter their telomeres were, even after the researchers accounted for potentially confounding factors such as diet and smoking. Telomeres normally shorten at a more or less constant rate in people, and calculations showed that these women’s telomeres had aged roughly an additional decade—and sometimes more—past those in the low-stress group. This discovery triggered a flood of supporting studies showing that stressors that include major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and the experience of racial discrimination can all accelerate telomere shortening. Unsurprisingly, lower childhood SES also predicts shorter telomeres in adulthood; perceived poor neighborhood quality, witnessing or experiencing violence, family instability (such as divorce, death or incarceration of a parent), and other features of poor status early on are tied to these shrunken chromosome tips later in life. Spend your childhood in poverty, and by middle age your telomeres will probably be about a decade older than those of people with more fortunate childhoods. Thus, from the macro level of entire body systems to the micro level of individual chromosomes, poverty finds a way to produce wear and tear. Most studies of telomere length compare “poor” with “non-poor,” as do the studies comparing allostatic load, but the few studies that examine the whole spectrum of inequality, step by low-status step, show that every rung down the SES ladder most likely worsens these biological markers of aging. Slipping down these rungs also changes the brain and behavior, according to a slew of recent neurobiological studies. My laboratory has devoted more than a quarter of a century to studying what ongoing stress does to the brain in rodents, monkeys and humans. Along with other labs, we have learned that one hotspot is the hippocampus, a region critical to learning and memory. Sustained stress or exposure to excessive glucocorticoids impairs memory by lowering hippocampal excitability, retracting connections between neurons and suppressing the birth of new neurons. In the amygdala, a brain area that is central to fear and anxiety, stress and glucocorticoids heighten those two reactions. Instead of damping things down as they do in the hippocampus, in this fear-promoting region they increase excitability and expand neuronal connections. Together these findings help to explain why post-traumatic stress disorder atrophies the hippocampus and enlarges the amygdala. Another affected area is the mesolimbic dopamine system, which is crucial to reward, anticipation and motivation. Chronic stress disrupts that system, and the result is a predisposition toward the anhedonia of depression and vulnerability to addiction. Bombardment by glucocorticoids also affects the prefrontal cortex (PFC), key to long-term planning, executive function and impulse control. In the PFC, social stress and elevated glucocorticoids weaken connections between neurons, making it harder for them to communicate. Myelination, the process that insulates cables between neurons and thus helps them pass signals faster, is impaired. Total cell volume in the region declines, and chronic inflammation is activated.

Bloomsbury, 2009; Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce (U.S. income per capita data); Human Development Report 2007/2008: Fighting Climate Change: Human Solidarity in a Divided World. United Nations Development Program, 2007 (GDP per capita data) What happens when the PFC is impaired in this way? Lousy, impulsive decisions happen. Consider “temporal discounting”: when choosing between an immediate reward and a bigger one if you wait, the appeal of waiting goes down as the time you have to wait goes up. The PFC is normally good at combating this shortsightedness. But stress steepens temporal discounting; the more cumulative stress, the less PFC activation in experiments that call for gratification postponement. For people sliding further into inequality, the less active PFC makes it harder for the brain to choose long-term health over immediate pleasure. That neurological effect might explain why people with more total life stress gain more weight and smoke and drink more than those with fewer stressors. These changes in the PFC happen in children, too. In separate studies, Martha Farah of the University of Pennsylvania and W. Thomas Boyce, professor emeritus at U.C.S.F., observed that lower-SES kindergartners typically have elevated glucocorticoid levels, a thinner and less active PFC, and poor PFC-dependent impulse control and executive function. These effects increase as kids get older. By adolescence, lower SES predicts smaller PFC volume. By adulthood, low SES predicts steeper temporally discounted decisions. Some of these observations present a tricky chicken-and-egg question. The brain changes could lead to poor choices, which in turn lead to deeper poverty, rather than the other way around. But the research suggests that causes and effects run in the other direction, with SES and inequality first influencing PFC function and then other bad things happening. For example, kindergartners’ SES predicted their PFC function; few five-year-olds plummet into poverty by squandering their paychecks on drink and horses. Further evidence comes from a 2013 study by Jiaying Zhao of the University of British Columbia and her colleagues. They examined Indian farmers whose economic fortunes vary seasonably. As individuals’ SES went from being poorest during planting season to wealthiest after harvest, improvements in PFC function followed. To me, the most important evidence comes from research in which people’s sense of their SES was lowered by the design of the experiment. Afterward these individuals did heavier temporal discounting. In one 2012 study, subjects played a game of chance against one another, with differing amounts of starting resources. “Poor” subjects became more likely to borrow against future earnings and less attuned to helpful clues about game strategy. In another study, subjects who were prompted to imagine scenarios of financial loss (versus neutral or advantageous ones) did steeper temporal discounting in an unrelated task. In still other research, subjects were primed to imagine their financial burdens by contemplating an expensive car repair; cognitive function was unchanged in high-SES subjects but declined in poorer individuals. Why should a transient sense of lower SES induce cognitive changes typical of lower SES in the real world? One explanation is that it is a rational response because it is hard to think about squirreling away money for old age if you can barely buy groceries. Poverty makes the future a less relevant place. But there is also a powerful stress-related explanation: long-term planning and impulse control tires out the PFC. Increase subjects’ cognitive “load” with taxing PFC-dependent tasks, and they become more likely to cheat on their diet. Or you can—and scientists have done this—increase cognitive load by tempting dieting subjects with snacks, and then they do worse on PFC-dependent tests. How much this represents literal “depletion” of the PFC metabolically versus declining motivation is unclear. Either way, lower SES creates chronic financial worry that distracts and exhausts. It is hard to ace a psychological task of, say, subtracting a series of numbers or a more important task of reining in your drinking when you are worrying about paying your rent. One finding in the car-repair study supports this interpretation. When subjects contemplated a repair of negligible cost, low- and high-SES subjects performed equally well on cognitive tasks. Of course, we need to better understand the biological consequences of inequality and learn better ways to heal its health scars. But frankly, right now we know quite a bit. We know enough to prompt moral outrage at the situation. It is outrageous that if children are born into a disadvantaged family, they will be predisposed toward poor health by the time they start to learn the alphabet. It should not require us to measure inflammation or the length of chromosomes to prove this is wrong, but if it does, more power to this science. Robert M. Sapolsky is a professor of biological sciences, neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford University and a research associate at the National Museums of Kenya. In his laboratory work, he focuses on how stress can damage the brain and on gene therapy for the nervous system. He also studies populations of wild baboons in East Africa, trying to determine the relation between the social rank of a baboon and its health.

    "onlytext": "Western cultures have long cherished the notion that all people are created equal. But in the real world, our lives are not balanced with equal opportunities and resources. This distinction was noted mordantly in 1894 by author Anatole France, who wrote that “the law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.” The rich, of course, need none of these things, whereas the poor often have little choice. And economic disparity has only gotten worse during the past several decades, particularly in the U.S. In 1976 the richest 1 percent of U.S. citizens owned 9 percent of the country’s wealth; today they own about 30 percent. This trend echoes around the globe.\n\nOne of the consequences for the growing poor is worsening health, and the reasons are not as obvious as you might think. Yes, lower socioeconomic status (SES) means less access to health care and living in more disease-prone neighborhoods. And, yes, as the SES ladder’s lower rungs have become more populated, the number of people with medical problems has climbed. This is not merely an issue of poor health for the poor and some version of better health for everyone else. Starting with Elon Musk at the top, every step down the ladder is associated with worse health.\n\nThe link between socioeconomic inequality and poor health goes beyond simple access to care and living with more dangers. Fewer than half of the health changes along this SES/health ladder can be explained away by risks such as smoking, alcohol consumption and reliance on fast food or by protective factors such as insurance and health club memberships. \n\nFurther, this ladder, or gradient, exists in nations with universal health care; if care availability were truly responsible, universal access should make the gradient vanish. Something else, something quite powerful, must be associated with inequities and be able to cause health problems.\n\nThat factor seems to be the stressful psychosocial consequences of low SES. Psychologist Nancy Adler of the University of California, San Francisco, and her colleagues have demonstrated that how people rate how they are doing, relative to others, is at least as predictive of health or illness as are any objective measures such as actual income level. The research indicates that poor health is as much about feeling poor as being poor.\n\nEpidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett of the University of Nottingham and the University of York in England, respectively, have filled out this picture in detail, showing that while poverty is bad for your health, poverty amid plenty—inequality—can be worse by just about any measure: infant mortality, overall life expectancy, obesity, murder rates, and more. Health is particularly corroded by your nose constantly being rubbed in what you do not have.\n\nBasically, more unequal societies have worse quality of life. Across countries and among U.S. states, more inequality, independent of absolute levels of income, predicts higher rates of crime, including homicide, and higher incarceration rates. Add in higher rates of kids being bullied at schools, more teen pregnancies and lower literacy. There are more psychiatric problems, alcoholism and drug use, as well as lower levels of happiness and less social mobility. And there is less social support—a steep hierarchy is the antithesis of the equality and symmetry that nourish friendship.\n\nThis grim collective picture helps to explain the immensely important fact that when inequality increases, everyone’s health suffers. This is where the problem affects the rich, the haves, as well as the have-nots. With increasing inequality, they typically expend more resources insulating themselves from the world underneath the bridges.\n\nI have heard economist Robert Evans of the University of British Columbia call this the “secession of the wealthy.” They spend more of their own resources on gated communities, private schools, bottled water and expensive organic food. And they give lots of money to politicians who help them maintain their status. It is stressful to construct thick walls to keep everything stressful out.\n\nKnowing that these psychological and social factors influence the biology of disease is one thing. Demonstrating just how these stressors do their dirty work inside the body is something else. How do SES and inequality “get under the skin”? It turns out that researchers have made significant strides toward an answer.\n\nWe have learned a lot about how poverty affects biology, and the part of the growing inequality gap that worries people is the poverty end. Scientists have been able to trace physiological connections from external inequality to three key inner areas: chronic inflammation, chromosomal aging and brain function.\n\nThinking about the biology of disease was revolutionized in the 1990s, when the late Bruce McEwen of the Rockefeller University introduced the concept of allostatic load. Our bodies are constantly challenged by our environment, and we stay healthy when we meet those challenges and return to a baseline state, or homeostasis.\n\nTeresa Seeman of the University of California, Los Angeles, took this idea and followed it through the body, measuring various biomarkers of wear and tear, including increases in blood pressure, cholesterol, blood lipids, body mass index, molecular indicators of chronic hyperglycemia, and levels of stress hormones. She showed that this group of disparate measures powerfully predicts physical health and mortality.\n\nRecent research by Seeman and others links low SES with heavy allostatic load because the body is in a constant and futile battle to return to a normal, nonstressed state. These findings highlight an important theme: whereas an adult’s SES predicts allostatic wear and tear, childhood SES leaves a stronger lifelong mark.\n\nLow SES predisposes youngsters’ bodies toward earlier “aging.” The scientists also found protective factors. Although growing up in an impoverished neighborhood worsens the low SES–allostatic load link, lucking out with a mother who has the time and energy to be highly nurturing reduces the ill effects.\n\nStress in any form can produce these effects. It does not have to be related to money, but it is usually related to social situations. My own work with baboons living freely on the East African savanna has shown this effect. In baboon groups, an animal’s place in the social hierarchy produces more or less stress.\n\nIf you are a low-ranking baboon—a socially stressful situation—your body has unhealthy abnormalities in its secretion of glucocorticoids, which are stress hormones such as cortisol. The body also shows unhealthy changes in the gonadal, cardiovascular and immune systems.\n\nIn animal and human hierarchies, these stress-induced changes affect health through a key process: chronic inflammation.

    "text": "How do the rich stay rich? Apparently, by acting like they’re not. In a world of fast fashion, TikTok trends and next-day delivery, it might be easy to splash a six-figure salary on all the latest consumables. But the high net worth individuals and $100,000+ earners Fortune spoke to said the opposite: They try and keep their discretionary spending as minimal as possible, preferring the impact it has on their finances. While their friends might enjoy eating out a couple of times a week, they choose to cook for themselves—in fact, they even buy frozen groceries because they’re cheaper than fresh. Some choose not to own cars, mend their own ‘capsule’ wardrobes and find some of their children’s toys on Facebook marketplace. These individuals—in some cases unconsciously—are living an ‘under-consumption’ or ‘low consumption’ lifestyle. The phrase began to spread on social media sites like TikTok after individuals started sharing their weekly grocery shop or make-up cabinet to counter the infinite shopping hauls or wishlists often found on the app. The advice from the ‘underconsumption core’ community included setting no-buy challenges or decluttering spaces packed with items you’re not using.  For the individuals Fortune spoke to, these habits are already second nature. And having lived the underconsumption life for most of their adult years, their bank balance is reaping the rewards. Author and entrepreneur Shang Saavedra and her husband didn’t build a multi-million dollar net worth overnight. In fact, it was in their respective childhoods that they learned the value of frugal living. Renting a four-bed home in the suburbs of Los Angeles, the pair share a 16-year-old secondhand vehicle and do their grocery shop at Aldi—predominantly in the frozen section.  Saavedra’s sons—aged five and two—often wear hand-me-down clothes, play with toys found on Facebook marketplace and enjoy free activities instead of the Disneyland trips their Californian peers often take.  While multi-millionaire Saavedra’s life has some hallmarks of a high-income household—her children attend private school, and she owns property in New York—these expenditures fit with her financial ethos: investing in education and assets that support her philanthropic endeavors. Contrary to the majority of Americans—58% of which told a Harris Poll survey last year they worry about their finances during the festive period—Saavedra says her day-to-day expenses during Thanksgiving and Christmas predominantly increase because of philanthropic gifting.  The 39-year-old’s ability to share her wealth is courtesy of shrewd money decisions in her early career—when she held a director position at CVS, and analyst and consultancy roles at the likes of Victoria’s Secret. Before marriage, Saavedra lived with roommates and then moved into a rent-controlled apartment with her husband in New York (a building where the plumbing often cut out), often using meal vouchers handed out by working late in their corporate roles. They aimed to reduce their expenditures to a single income and save the rest, in preparation for having children. Saavedra, now an entrepreneur helping hundreds of clients achieve their financial goals, told Fortune in an interview that the best way for people to try an underconsumption lifestyle is to “start with why.” “What is the end goal of underconsumption? If you just do underconsumption for underconsumption’s sake you’ll burn out and get unhappy very quickly,” Saavedra explained. “Because my husband and I oriented our consumption towards financial freedom and family it’s made it so worth it.  “Of course I still am tempted to go for luxury items and experiences, and every now and then we have a nice date night at a very nice restaurant—but understanding the reason why you want something … comes from a pain for an unfulfilled part of your life and oftentimes is a psychological need.” What it takes to run a household is only getting more expensive. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average monthly household expenditure in 2023 was $6,440. This is a steep increase compared to only a year prior—up 8.3%—and up 15.5% from 2021, when monthly expenditures sat at $5,577 a month. Yet despite the fact Annie Cole owns assets totaling more than a million dollars—and is earning six figures—she has trimmed her spending down to a little under $4,000 a month. Cole sold her Prius a couple of years ago, batch cooks meals for her and her husband, cuts her own hair and clothes shops three times a year at her local Goodwill—Cole last purchased new clothes a year ago, and with a gift card. The couple travel using air miles and points accrued when Cole, 36, was traveling for a corporate role, spending their vacations enjoying free activities like hiking and swimming.  The approach has not only changed Cole’s outlook on how long she will work—retirement is pencilled in for her early 40s—but the nature of work itself.  “I’m so curious if I will actually want to retire,” Cole—who works as a contracted researcher and personal finance expert—tells Fortune. “Now that I’m working part-time I think about it differently. When I was working full-time I thought ‘I can’t wait to be work-optional’  but I almost feel like I’m living it now.  “I’m doing all the things I want to do and knowing that I could retire feels like a nice financial cushion of ‘Hey, you’re taken care of as you get older and in the meantime you have the flexibility to live and work differently.’ That’s a blessing in itself.”  Dentist Robert Chin and his partner Jessica Pharar own a practice in Las Vegas. They commute the short drive from their home together to cut down on fuel, with their packed lunches in tow. The couple transitioned into a lower-consumption lifestyle courtesy of rising costs and a firmer idea of what they wanted their finances to look like—despite the pair earning comfortable six figures. Chin tells Fortune he now eats out one or two times a month instead of a few times a week, and shops at Costco to avoid inflationary grocery prices as best he can. Unlike the other sources Fortune spoke to, Chin isn’t against buying new clothes but maintains that they must have a lifetime guarantee (from the likes of Patagonia) or that they will last for years. The pair own a condo which they let out, but rent their current property to have the flexibility to purchase when the market begins to move again.  Their goal is simple: Flexibility—whether that means taking more time off together or potentially retiring earlier.  “In five years we’d like to have an associate or another practitioner both because the office has grown enough to support that and also because it affords us the flexibility to take time off more readily. It’s proabably the biggest challenge of us being leaders in the business, our ability to take time off is really difficult because if we’re not here the practice doesn’t make money.” Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning senior reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance.

    "onlytext": "In a world of fast fashion, TikTok trends and next-day delivery, it might be easy to splash a six-figure salary on all the latest consumables. But the high net worth individuals and $100,000+ earners Fortune spoke to said the opposite: They try and keep their discretionary spending as minimal as possible, preferring the impact it has on their finances. While their friends might enjoy eating out a couple of times a week, they choose to cook for themselves—in fact, they even buy frozen groceries because they’re cheaper than fresh. Some choose not to own cars, mend their own ‘capsule’ wardrobes and find some of their children’s toys on Facebook marketplace. These individuals—in some cases unconsciously—are living an ‘under-consumption’ or ‘low consumption’ lifestyle. The phrase began to spread on social media sites like TikTok after individuals started sharing their weekly grocery shop or make-up cabinet to counter the infinite shopping hauls or wishlists often found on the app. The advice from the ‘underconsumption core’ community included setting no-buy challenges or decluttering spaces packed with items you’re not using.\n\nFor the individuals Fortune spoke to, these habits are already second nature. And having lived the underconsumption life for most of their adult years, their bank balance is reaping the rewards.\n\nAuthor and entrepreneur Shang Saavedra and her husband didn’t build a multi-million dollar net worth overnight. In fact, it was in their respective childhoods that they learned the value of frugal living. Renting a four-bed home in the suburbs of Los Angeles, the pair share a 16-year-old secondhand vehicle and do their grocery shop at Aldi—predominantly in the frozen section.  Saavedra’s sons—aged five and two—often wear hand-me-down clothes, play with toys found on Facebook marketplace and enjoy free activities instead of the Disneyland trips their Californian peers often take.\n\nWhile multi-millionaire Saavedra’s life has some hallmarks of a high-income household—her children attend private school, and she owns property in New York—these expenditures fit with her financial ethos: investing in education and assets that support her philanthropic endeavors. Contrary to the majority of Americans—58% of which told a Harris Poll survey last year they worry about their finances during the festive period—Saavedra says her day-to-day expenses during Thanksgiving and Christmas predominantly increase because of philanthropic gifting.\n\nThe 39-year-old’s ability to share her wealth is courtesy of shrewd money decisions in her early career—when she held a director position at CVS, and analyst and consultancy roles at the likes of Victoria’s Secret. Before marriage, Saavedra lived with roommates and then moved into a rent-controlled apartment with her husband in New York (a building where the plumbing often cut out), often using meal vouchers handed out by working late in their corporate roles. They aimed to reduce their expenditures to a single income and save the rest, in preparation for having children.\n\nSaavedra, now an entrepreneur helping hundreds of clients achieve their financial goals, told Fortune in an interview that the best way for people to try an underconsumption lifestyle is to “start with why.” “What is the end goal of underconsumption? If you just do underconsumption for underconsumption’s sake you’ll burn out and get unhappy very quickly,” Saavedra explained. “Because my husband and I oriented our consumption towards financial freedom and family it’s made it so worth it.\n\n“Of course I still am tempted to go for luxury items and experiences, and every now and then we have a nice date night at a very nice restaurant—but understanding the reason why you want something … comes from a pain for an unfulfilled part of your life and oftentimes is a psychological need.”\n\nWhat it takes to run a household is only getting more expensive. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average monthly household expenditure in 2023 was $6,440. This is a steep increase compared to only a year prior—up 8.3%—and up 15.5% from 2021, when monthly expenditures sat at $5,577 a month.\n\nYet despite the fact Annie Cole owns assets totaling more than a million dollars—and is earning six figures—she has trimmed her spending down to a little under $4,000 a month. Cole sold her Prius a couple of years ago, batch cooks meals for her and her husband, cuts her own hair and clothes shops three times a year at her local Goodwill—Cole last purchased new clothes a year ago, and with a gift card. The couple travel using air miles and points accrued when Cole, 36, was traveling for a corporate role, spending their vacations enjoying free activities like hiking and swimming.\n\nThe approach has not only changed Cole’s outlook on how long she will work—retirement is pencilled in for her early 40s—but the nature of work itself.\n\n“I’m so curious if I will actually want to retire,” Cole—who works as a contracted researcher and personal finance expert—tells Fortune. “Now that I’m working part-time I think about it differently.

    "domain": "fortune.com",
    "text": "Move over, Hermès and Miu Miu—the newest luxury purse flying under the radar is a crinkled paper bag filled with burgers and greasy fries. The vast majority of Americans now find fast food way too expensive, dubbing it a “luxury,” a new report found. Of 2,000 American adults, 78% considered fast food a luxury because of its price tag, loan marketplace LendingTree found in a survey released Monday, using data from QuestionPro commissioned by ValuePenguin. Half of respondents said their own stretched financial situation made fast food feel like a luxury, and more than six in 10 said they had cut down on fast food because of rising prices. “Fast food often isn’t this quick, cheap option anymore,” LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz told Fortune over email. “People are having sticker shock at the drive-thru, causing them to rethink how often they eat fast food.” Respondents participated in the survey in early April—the same time California’s $20 minimum wage law for fast-food workers went into effect, causing chains like Chipotle to threaten 6%–7% increases in menu price. Even before the minimum wage law was enacted, consumers revolted against McDonald’s $18 Big Mac meal and blasted Wendy’s for its introduction of “dynamic pricing” in February, using AI to change menu item costs depending on the level of traffic during certain times of day. The burger chain backtracked the day after the announcement, saying it had no plans to raise prices, only provide discounts. Indeed, pinched consumers are most concerned about surge pricing, with 72% of those surveyed saying they would dine during off-hours if it meant cheaper menu items. Over half of respondents said they now cook at home if they’re looking for a quick, cheap meal. Stephen Zagor, food and restaurant consultant and adjunct assistant professor of business at the Columbia Business School, told Fortune that bad attitudes toward fast-food companies are an extension of the mentality so many have about the economy. As fast-food prices continue to rise even as inflation cools, consumer sentiment is dipping: In May, it reached its lowest point in six months. “We’re in this inflationary mental cycle as much as we are an inflationary reality cycle,” Zagor said. But there’s good news on the horizon for customers feeling dejected by the state of fast-food prices, Zagor said. Burger chains are feeling pressure to make changes. “They hear the customers’ pain, and they’re trying to be responsive—as they well should be,” he said. McDonald’s announced last week its plans to launch a $5 meal deal of a burger or chicken sandwich, fries, a four-piece nugget, and a drink. Wendy’s responded similarly, rolling out a $3 breakfast deal with breakfast potatoes and a choice of bacon or sausage, egg, and cheese English muffin. The changes came after fast-food chains noticed sales dips driven by choosy customers. “The consumer is certainly being very discriminating in how they spend their dollar,” McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said during a call with investors this month. “It may be more pronounced with lower-income consumers, but it’s important to recognize that all income cohorts are seeking value.” While McDonald’s is only promising its $5 meal deal for a month—with franchisees asking the company to invest in the operation—additional promotions are likely to stick around, though likely in different forms, such as app-exclusive deals or cheap menu add-ons for digital orders, Zagor said. Fast-food companies are under pressure to keep their customers happy, even if it is initially a bigger lift for investors and the bottom line, he argued. A “relationship-based” business, the restaurant industry still has to promise its diners a return on the dining experience, even if it’s just a quick drive-thru transaction. With over 70 million customers daily, chains like McDonald’s are a cornerstone of people’s lives, Zagor said, and they are under obligation to stay that way. “The truth of the matter is, we love McDonald’s. It’s an American brand. It’s who we are—good or bad, hate it or love it, think it’s healthy or unhealthy. It’s who we are.” Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

    "title": "Luxury homes are more expensive than ever, and the market is doing better than you’d think",
    "domain": "fortune.com",
    "text": "Luxury homes are, well, luxurious—but they happen to be more expensive than ever, too. The typical luxury home sold for a record $1,225,000 in the first quarter of this year, 8.7% higher than the year before, according to Redfin.  Spending more than a million dollars on a home might not seem like much for those in California, but it is. It turns out luxury home prices are rising much faster than those of non-luxury homes, which are at a record high, too, but only rose 4.6% in the first quarter to $345,000. (The analysis considers luxury homes as those in the top 5% of their respective metropolitan area in terms of value.) The three most expensive home sales across the country occurred in Miami, Seattle, and Los Angeles, for $48 million, $38.9 million, and $38.5 million, respectively, in the first quarter.  Apparently demand for opulent homes is still very prevalent, but part of that is because those who can afford luxury homes are undeterred by high mortgage rates—either because they pay in cash, or can afford it either way. The number of luxury homes bought in all-cash is at an all-time high, according to Redfin: Nearly half of luxury homes purchased during the three months ended Feb. 29 were purchased in cash (the highest in at least a decade). Even so, demand for such homes has “held up better than demand for middle-of-the-road homes,” Redfin’s data journalist Dana Anderson wrote in an analysis published Friday. And more demand has translated to more sales. Sales of lavish homes rose 2.1% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. But sales of non-luxury, or typical, homes fell 4.2% over the same period.  “People with the means to buy high-end homes are jumping in now because they feel confident prices will continue to rise,” David Palmer, a Seattle-based Redfin agent, said in the analysis. “They’re ready to buy with more optimism and less apprehension.” Palmer added, “It’s a similar sentiment on the selling side: Prices continue to increase for high-end homes, so homeowners feel it’s a good time to cash in on their equity. Even though mortgage rates remain elevated and demand isn’t as high as it was during the pandemic, many homebuyers and sellers feel the worst of the housing downturn is behind us.” Interestingly enough, luxury-home sales only began rising in January for the first time since August 2021, but non-luxury home sales haven’t risen since the end of that same year. All existing home sales fell last year to their lowest point in 28 years. And after what felt like the beginning of a recovery, existing home sales fell again in March on a monthly and annual basis—but home prices rose.  So what’s happening in the luxury market isn’t too far off from the broader housing world, even if it is doing better than the so-called normal home market. But it might be doing better than you’d expect.  In March last year, Redfin published an analysis that found luxury-home sales declined almost 45% in the three months ended Jan. 31. It was greater than the drop in sales for non-luxury homes, which had fallen more than 37% in the same period. At the time, Redfin listed several reasons for its fall: People were tending to purchase fewer expensive things during a period of economic uncertainty; luxury-home sales rose faster during the pandemic housing boom so they had more room to fall; and the wealthy were losing money in the stock market and were generally worried about real estate.  Maybe the latest news signals a change in the mindset of the wealthy. Or it could be as simple as there being more luxury homes on the market. “The total number of luxury homes for sale rose 12.6% from a year earlier in the first quarter, the biggest increase on record,” Anderson wrote, adding: “New listings of luxury homes soared 18.5% from a year earlier in the first quarter, the second consecutive quarter of double-digit increases.” Part of this has to do with the “lock-in effect,” which refers to homeowners refusing to sell for fear of losing their low mortgage rate. It has less of an impact on luxury homeowners, either because they can take on a new, higher mortgage rate or buy their home in cash (as opposed to less-wealthy people). Both figures are substantially greater than those of non-luxury homes, but are still lower than pre-pandemic levels—and that’s part of the reason we’re seeing prices go up.

    "title": "Billionaire Wealth Surged By $2 Trillion Last Year, Report Shows",
    "domain": "forbes.com",
    "text": "ByJosie Cox, Contributor. The combined wealth of the world’s richest individuals surged by $2 trillion last year—three times faster than in 2023—according to a new report published on the eve of the World Economic Forum, an annual meeting of billionaires, hosted in the Swiss Alps.  The report by Oxfam, an organization working to alleviate poverty and inequality around the world, found that 204 new billionaires were minted in 2024. In the U.S. alone—where wealth concentration is particularly high—the net worth of billionaires billowed by about $3.9 billion on average each day last year and 74 new billionaires emerged.  “The capture of our global economy by a privileged few has reached heights once considered unimaginable,” said Oxfam International Executive Director Amitabh Behar. “The failure to stop billionaires is now spawning soon-to-be trillionaires. Not only has the rate of billionaire wealth accumulation accelerated—by three times—but so too has their power,” he added.  Oxfam noted that the power of billionaires will be on particular display not just at the Davos WEF this week but also in Washington D.C, where Donald Trump will on Monday begin his second presidential term.  According to Oxfam, Trump’s team will be the richest ever to run the U.S. government, worth more than an estimated $450 billion. So far, at least 13 billionaires have been appointed to jobs in his administration, Oxfam concluded, and even excluding Elon Musk, who reportedly spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump win November's election, the cabinet would be the richest in history.  Musk, currently has an estimated net worth of around $427 billion, making him the richest individual on the planet, followed by Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, at around $237 billion, and Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, at around $211 billion. All three are expected to attend Trump’s inauguration. According to Forbes, Trump’s net worth grew from about $2.5 billion to an estimated $6.1 billion during the course of 2024, thanks in part to his majority stake in Truth Social’s parent company.  “We present this report as a stark wake up-call that ordinary people the world over are being crushed by the enormous wealth of a tiny few,” Behar said.  Oxfam’s research also found that more than a third of billionaire wealth is now inherited. Last year, a report by investment bank UBS about the super-rich, found that over the previous decade, multigenerational billionaires had inherited a total of $1.3 trillion.  “The ultra-rich like to tell us that getting rich takes skill, grit and hard work. But the truth is most wealth is taken, not made,” said Behar. “So many of the so-called ‘self-made’ are actually heirs to vast fortunes, handed down through generations of unearned privilege.” Earlier this month, a major survey conducted across 36 nations showed that economic inequality is now a grave public concern around the world, with many people particularly worried about the influence that the super-rich are having on policies and business decisions that exacerbate the wealth gap. The survey of more than 40,000 adults, done by the Pew Research Center last year and published in early January, found that a median of 54% of respondents across the countries said that they thought the chasm between the rich and poor was a very big problem in their nation. A further 30% said that they thought it was a moderately big problem. A median of 60%, meanwhile, said that the political influence enjoyed by the wealthiest individuals was a major contributor to economic inequality. These views, Pew found, were particularly common among respondents identifying as being on the ideological left, though many of those who identified as being on the right agreed too. Ideological divisions, the research showed, were especially large in the U.S.  The WEF meeting this year takes place from Jan. 20 to Jan. 24. This year’s theme is “Collaboration for the Intelligent Age.” The annual Davos meetings were first launched in 1971 to champion stakeholder capitalism but over the decades they’ve become a punching bag for social justice advocates, largely because of the extreme wealth of many of the attendees. This year—with many wars raging around the world—armed conflict is likely to top the agenda and dominate conversations during the four days in the Alpine town. Donald Trump is expected to address the meeting on Jan. 23.",

    "onlytext": "The combined wealth of the world’s richest individuals surged by $2 trillion last year—three times faster than in 2023—according to a new report published on the eve of the World Economic Forum, an annual meeting of billionaires, hosted in the Swiss Alps.  \nThe report by Oxfam, an organization working to alleviate poverty and inequality around the world, found that 204 new billionaires were minted in 2024. In the U.S. alone—where wealth concentration is particularly high—the net worth of billionaires billowed by about $3.9 billion on average each day last year and 74 new billionaires emerged.  \n“The capture of our global economy by a privileged few has reached heights once considered unimaginable,” said Oxfam International Executive Director Amitabh Behar. “The failure to stop billionaires is now spawning soon-to-be trillionaires. Not only has the rate of billionaire wealth accumulation accelerated—by three times—but so too has their power,” he added.  \nOxfam noted that the power of billionaires will be on particular display not just at the Davos WEF this week but also in Washington D.C, where Donald Trump will on Monday begin his second presidential term.  \nAccording to Oxfam, Trump’s team will be the richest ever to run the U.S. government, worth more than an estimated $450 billion.

    "text": "The Giving Pledge is a charitable campaign, launched in 2010 by Bill and Melinda French Gates and Warren Buffett, that invites the world’s wealthiest individuals and families to publicly commit to giving away at least 50% of their wealth to philanthropy, either during their lifetimes or in their wills. The Institute for Policy Studies’ report “The Giving Pledge at 15” finds that the initiative—where billionaires publicly pledge to give at least half their wealth to charity—remains mostly unfulfilled, with most signatories far wealthier now than when they joined, and a majority of charitable giving funneled into private foundations and donor-advised funds rather than directly supporting operational charities. The IPS team, led by Chuck Collins, Bella DeVaan, Helen Flannery, and Dan Petergorsky, invites the public to examine its data and methodology. Collins is himself an Oscar Mayer heir who gave away his fortune and has dedicated his career to researching wealth inequality.

Among the 22 deceased U.S. Pledgers, only eight met their pledge before death—just one, Chuck Feeney, gave away his entire fortune while alive.

The initiative was designed to inspire generosity, set new norms for billionaire philanthropy, and shift how major wealth is used to address pressing social challenges The report advocates returning to the “giving while living” ethos exemplified by Chuck Feeney, and calls for systemic reforms to ensure charitable donations serve the public interest—not just the tax and legacy interests of the ultra-rich. The report “raises important questions, but excludes “significant forms of charitable giving,” The Giving Pledge said in a statement to Fortune. “For fifteen years, the Giving Pledge has helped create new norms of generosity and grown into a connected and active global learning community. The recent IPS report raises important questions that aim to encourage greater giving,” the organization said. “Unfortunately, the report’s reliance on incomplete data, and its exclusion of significant forms of charitable giving—such as gifts made to foundations and other intermediaries—paints a misleading picture of the impact and intent of Giving Pledge signatories and the spirit and intent of the Giving Pledge.” For this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

    "domain": "fortune.com",
    "text": "With each passing week in 2024 almost four new members joined the growing class of the ultra-rich, according to a recent report by anti-poverty advocacy firm Oxfam. The richest individuals in the world are doing a victory lap after last year, as billionaire wealth increased three times faster in 2024 than it did in 2023. In total, billionaire wealth skyrocketed by $2 trillion, adding more than 200 individuals to this cohort. The accumulation of riches at the very top is going so unchecked that Oxfam estimates  there will be five trillionaires within the coming decade. But nothing all that golden is minting these new wealthy individuals.“Most billionaire wealth is taken, not earned, 60% comes from either inheritance, cronyism and corruption or monopoly power,” Oxfam writes in the report.  Wealthy families are passing down trillions of dollars in wealth per year, creating “a new aristocratic oligarchy that has immense power in our politics and our economy,”  according to Oxfam, which adds that more than a third (36%) of billionaire wealth comes from family money.,  The ultra-wealthy are wielding a tight fist on their fortunes, keeping the ever-ballooning riches in the family. In the coming thirty years more than a thousand of the current billionaires will transfer more than $5.2 trillion to their heirs, writes Oxfam. Much of this transfer will go “largely untaxed,” the nonprofit writes. Two-thirds of countries studied in the report don’t tax inheritance to direct descendents. Beyond nepotism, the report finds that cronyism is a major driver of wealth. Cronyism refers to the bankrolling and backing of friends, especially when it comes to the appointments and lobbying of a political system. Oxfam estimates that 6% of the ultra-wealthy riches are from “crony sources,” while countries with lax regulations tend to produce more billionaires Lastly, billionaires have maintained their winning streak by the power of unmitigated monopolies. Calling out Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ domain of online purchases in many countries and Aliko Dangote’s hold on cement in Nigeria, Oxfam says that about 18% of billionaires’ wealth comes from said sole ownership.  In his farewell address, President Biden warned of a “oligarchy,” which threatened the fabric of democracy. Indeed, the total net worth of the 100 wealthiest citizens soared by $1.5 trillion from 2021 until 2024, per Bloomberg. “The election of Donald Trump as U.S. President in November gave a huge further boost to billionaire fortunes, while his policies – such as gigantic tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and corporations – are set to fan the flames of inequality further,” writes Oxfam. A number of the world’s richest men flanked President Trump during his inauguration, including Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla’s Elon Musk. It wasn’t just Silicon Valley CEOs who showed their support. LVMH’s chief Bernard Arnault and his family were in attendance as well as India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani. The collective worth of said billionaires attending reached a whopping $1.35 trillion, according to Forbes. The individual wealth of the richest 10 men in the world increased last year by almost $100 million on an average day, per Oxfam. “When the 3 wealthiest men in America sit behind Trump at his inauguration, everyone understands that the billionaire class now controls our government,” tweeted Senator Bernie Sanders of what he deemed an oligarchy. “We must fight back,” he wrote. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

    "domain": "newsweek.com",
    "text": "Published Aug 13, 2025 at 07:30 AM EDT Institute for Policy Studies The Giving Pledge just turned 15. Bill Gates, Melinda French, and Warren Buffett founded the Pledge in August 2010 to boost charitable giving among billionaires. Pledgers agree to give away half or more of their wealth within their lifetimes, or upon their deaths. The effort was inspired by Duty Free Shoppers founder Chuck Feeney, the reluctant billionaire who advocated \"giving while living.\" Feeney gave away over $8 billion before he died, relinquishing his billionaire status to live a more modest life. \"[Feeney] told me we should encourage people not to give just 50 percent,\" Gates recounted, \"but as much as possible during their lifetime.\" The Giving Pledge is the largest and most visible public commitment that billionaires have made to distribute their vast fortunes. Over 256 individuals, couples, and families have signed, including 194 from the United States. Our tax code's charitable deductions effectively allow billionaires to \"opt out\" of taxes—ostensibly to give back through charity. In the absence of higher taxes on the wealthy that could fund a stronger social safety net, voluntary commitments like the Giving Pledge are important. But in an era of staggering wealth inequality—and tax avoidance—privately held fortunes are larger than anyone can fathom. And charitable contributions simply aren't keeping up with what could be raised from a fairer tax code. In our new report, The Giving Pledge at 15, we found that the explosive growth of Giving Pledgers' wealth is outpacing their giving. At this rate, the Giving Pledge appears to be mostly an empty promise. Along with our co-authors Helen Flannery and Dan Petegorsky, we analyzed the philanthropic records of the pledgers. Some are bold and direct, like MacKenzie Scott, who's vowed to \"keep at it until the safe is empty.\" Others need to pick up the pace, like John Paul DeJoria, whose foundation has awarded $54 million since its inception eight years ago—a paltry sum compared to his roughly $3 billion fortune. And there are those who seem to cravenly intertwine personal benefit with philanthropy—like Elon Musk, who in 2021 enjoyed some fortuitously timely tax relief from a stock transfer to his foundation. Across nearly every example, there's proof that the Pledge is unfulfilled, unfulfillable, and not our ticket to a fairer, better future. If hundreds of billionaires pledge to give away half their wealth in their lifetimes, we should expect that some would have less wealth than when they took the Pledge. But when adjusted for inflation, the 32 original U.S. pledgers who are still billionaires have collectively gotten 166 percent wealthier since they signed on in 2010. (Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan's wealth has increased an inflation-adjusted 2,919 percent since 2010!) Only one couple in this group, Laura and John Arnold, has fulfilled their commitment, moving billions in their lifetime—mostly to their own foundation. But that raises another issue. By our count, 80 percent of Giving Pledge donations have gone to private foundations—and billions more to other intermediaries. Donors get an immediate tax deduction, but the funds can remain sidelined for generations before they're granted out to real working charities—if ever. Play this out another 15 years and we'll witness the rise of family-controlled dynastic foundations worth trillions. These foundations will wield tremendous power, especially as their windfalls contrast with catastrophic cuts to the social safety net like those in the GOP's Big Beautiful Bill. A select few families will essentially decide how publicly subsidized funds are spent, concentrating power over our politics and civil society and jeopardizing our democracy. At 15, the Giving Pledge must either go big or reconsider its value. One path forward is to encourage a \"Feeney Giving Pledge,\" an augmented commitment for existing pledgers to pay their fair share of taxes, give more while alive, and empower organizations led by non-billionaires to solve the urgent problems of our day. Feeney's example echoed in Bill Gates's May announcement that he would donate 99 percent of his Microsoft stock to his foundation, which he's pledged to wind down and close within 20 years. This voluntary effort would pair nicely with structural reforms. We should tax billionaires at a fair rate. And taxpayer-subsidized foundations and donor-advised funds (DAFs) should be subject to stronger transparency rules—and required to grant out funds to real, working charities more quickly. If billionaires' best intentions can't deliver a fairer economy, then it's up to the rest of us not to count on them.

And taxpayer-subsidized foundations and donor-advised funds (DAFs) should be subject to stronger transparency rules—and required to grant out funds to real, working charities more quickly.\n\nIf billionaires' best intentions can't deliver a fairer economy, then it's up to the rest of us not to count on them.",

    "text": "If there's one thing the Trump administration has a surplus of, it's billionaires. President Donald Trump himself is America's first billionaire president, boasting a net worth of $5.3 billion, according to Forbes. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found the median weekly earnings for U.S. workers was $1,194 in the first quarter of 2025 – or $62,088 a year. At that rate, it would take the average American roughly 85,350 years to reach Trump's net worth. Meanwhile, the total net worth of the billionaires who make up Trump's changing administration – including former friend Elon Musk, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent among them – equals at least $450 billion. And that money buys a lot of influence – and power. Maybe too much. That's the question we asked you. As part of our Opinion Forum, we asked USA TODAY readers what you thought about the growing power of billionaires: in our corporations, in our markets and, yes, in our government. Is this exorbitant wealth something to aspire to? Or is it a threat? Read the responses below. I do think the wealthy have too much power. Who listens to someone making minimum wage? (I'm speaking, by the way, as a former sociology professor, jail administrator and jail standards specialist.) Having a large number of very wealthy people in political power also has a negative effect on our democracy. The richer people are, the less they are in tune with the common people they are supposed to represent. The growth in the number of billionaires and in their collective wealth is not a sign of a healthy economy. A healthy economy is defined by a more equal income distribution. In the 1980s, CEOs earned about 40 times more than their hourly employees. Today it's about 300 times. There is something horribly wrong with this picture! I do think taxes should be raised on the the richest people in our country. The wealthy are not paying their fair share. They sit back in their mansions and yachts while the rest of us are desperately trying to keep our canoes afloat. — Bev Scott, Trinity, Texas Without data directly on hand about how much people in different income strata contribute to the federal budget, it’s hard to answer questions like whether we should raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans. But I'm in my 70s and have witnessed many things. My parents and their parents worked until they died. That work ethic comes with compensation. Some do better than others. The common thread is working. I support the work requirements for Medicaid recently approved by Congress and signed into law. The details are rarely published. The headlines are almost always divisive and incomplete.  Let’s stop accusing the wealthy as if they are criminals. They pay most of the taxes and give a tremendous amount to philanthropy. Google it! Get the best education you can afford. Get a job that adds value to your life and work hard. Vote in every election. And try your best to live a good life. Stop judging others. — Rick Bateman, Loveland, Ohio Our distribution of wealth is completely out of balance and will have dire consequences. I have no argument against infinite personal wealth as long as every citizen has access to basic essentials. Food, medical care, shelter, public safety, etc. should be a foundation for the populace. The uber wealthy can have all the mansions they want once everyone has a roof. Wealth is achieved through more than business acumen. Billionaires exist because they utilize economic and civic infrastructure, provided collectively by all of us. Their argument that \"I did it\" is, at best, specious. Without fundamental change, this will end badly. — Sam Collins, Gainesville, Florida The increased involvement of billionaires in our government has a huge effect on how our system operates. The ultra rich have always held sway over American democracy, but the days of their political dealings being done behind the scenes are long gone. Now, it's not only out in public every day that billionaires are controlling the government and looking to alter the country in such a way to elevate themselves even further above the average person, but it's also that a huge portion of the American public, most of them people who will be affected negatively by these actions, is still hugely supportive of this regime. This means that the country can continue to be run in such a way that the marginalized are stomped on while the rich get richer. It is now to the point that the Trump regime can brazenly break laws and defy courts with few to no repercussions, and this is, surely enough, eroding away the foundation of American democracy. — Ben Rivera, Salt Lake City",

    "title": "Here's How Much American Billionaires Have Lost In Trump's First 100 Days",
    "domain": "forbes.com",
    "text": "ByChase Peterson-Withorn, Forbes Staff. “This is what victory feels like,” Elon Musk declared the day Donald Trump was sworn in. “I'm super fired up for the future…One of the most American values that I love is optimism.” Now, as Donald Trump begins his 100th day back in office, much of the optimism has faded as the American stock market has gotten off to its worst start in 50 years, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both dropping by nearly 8% amid Trump’s tariff war. No one has been hit harder than Musk, who is $45 billion poorer than he was on Trump’s second inauguration day. Musk has taken to feuding with Trump tariff hawk Peter Navarro on social media, has said he will step back from leading Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, and has had to refocus on his electric carmaker Tesla, after tariff fears and Musk’s increasingly unpopular political efforts have sent the stock crashing 33%. He isn’t the only billionaire down big during Trump 2.0. Overall, America’s 800-some billionaires are $300 billion poorer since January 20. Joining Musk among the 10 biggest losers (in sheer dollar terms) are Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Alphabet’s Sergey Brin and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, three tech tycoons who scored prominent seats just behind the first family at Trump’s inauguration—and have since gone on to lose $35 billion, $26 billion and $22 billion in wealth, respectively. Other prominent Trump backers have dropped billions, too. Oracle’s Larry Ellison—who met with Trump the day after the inauguration as part of a $500 billion an AI infrastructure initiative—is America’s third-biggest loser so far, behind Musk and Bezos, down $28 billion. Blackstone cofounder Stephen Schwarzman, who initially said he would not support longtime friend’s 2024 campaign but soon backtracked, is $11 billion poorer. Of course some billionaires have managed to get richer despite the shaky markets. Warren Buffett—who called tariffs “an act of war, to some degree” ahead of Trump’s announcement—has kept Berkshire Hathaway steady, stashing a record $334 billion of the conglomerate’s money in cash and cash equivalents. That has helped push shares up 13% since Trump took office, adding nearly $20 billion to the Oracle of Omaha’s net worth. Other big billionaire winners so far: Peter Thiel (up $4.9 billion) and Alexander Karp ($3.6 billion), whose AI-powered data mining firm Palantir is America’s hottest stock, thanks in part to defense and software contracts with U.S. government agencies. The three surviving children of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992), meanwhile, are each at least $3 billion richer, as consumers have flocked to the retail giant amid elevated inflation; last week, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon met with Trump to argue against tariffs. And while former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who has kept much of his wealth in the tech giant’s stock, losing $8 billion so far in the process, founder Bill Gates has diversified his fortune into a wide range of investments, including a 35% stake in waste company Republic Services (up 15%), helping make him a big gainer. President Trump, meanwhile, has not been kind to businessman Trump. The commander-in-chief’s fortune is down $1.5 billion since he took charge of the U.S. government, as shares of his Trump Media & Technology Group—the parent company of Truth Social—have plunged by 35%, quadruple the broader market’s drop. He’s clearly paying attention to the gyrations. Standing in the Oval Office on April 9, Trump pointed to brokerage billionaire Charles Schwab: “He made $2.5 billion today,” he bragged, then turned to automotive billionaire Roger Penske: “And he made $900 million.” Both fortunes have continued to climb since then, but after racking up huge losses earlier in Trump’s first 100 days, Schwab is only $375 million, or 3%, richer than he was on the last day of Joe Biden’s presidency. Penske, meanwhile, is $1.1 billion poorer.",

(Kenny Holston/The New York Times via AP, Pool)       \n ATLANTA (AP) — President Donald Trump’s brash populism has always involved incongruence: the billionaire businessman-politician stirring the passions of millions who, regardless of the U.S. economy’s trajectory, could never afford to live in his Manhattan skyscraper or visit his club in south Florida. His second White House is looking a lot like the inside of Mar-a-Lago, with extremely wealthy Americans taking key roles in his Republican administration.  The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is overseeing a new Department of Government Efficiency. Billionaires or mega-millionaires are lined up to run the treasury, commerce, interior and education departments, NASA and the Small Business Administration, and fill key foreign posts.  “He’s bringing in folks who have had great success in the private sector,” said Debbie Dooley, an early 2015 Trump supporter and onetime national organizer in the anti-establishment Tea Party movement. “If you need to have brain surgery, you want the proven brain surgeons.” Others raise concerns about conflicts of interest at odds with Trump’s pledge to fight for “forgotten men and women” in a country where the median household net worth is about $193,000 and median annual household income is about $81,000. “It’s hard to conceive how the wealthiest set of Cabinet nominees and White House appointments in history will understand what average working people are going through,” said former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who served under President Bill Clinton and has warned for decades about the nation’s widening wealth and wage gaps. \n Countered Dooley: “Trump sets the agenda. If they won’t enact his policies, then they will hear him say what we hear on ‘The Apprentice’ all the time: ‘You’re fired!’” Here is a closer look at some of Trump’s picks, their net worth according to Forbes and Yahoo Finance, and what the choices could mean: Musk (net worth estimated above $400 billion) is chairing the new Department of Government Efficiency, which is a special commission charged with slashing federal spending. The extensive ties his businesses have to the government have raised questions about Musk’s potential conflicts in the role.  McMahon was picked to be Trump’s secretary of education. She is the wife of Vince McMahon, who is worth at least $3 billion. The former WWE wrestling executive will lead an agency that many conservatives have called for abolishing altogether. While that’s a heavy lift politically, McMahon and Trump have endorsed an expansion of “school choice,” programs that steer taxpayer money to private school tuition. She also could be in charge of implementing Trump’s proposals to withhold federal money from public schools — K-12 and higher education — that do not meet White House demands to modify or scrap diversity programs. The former North Dakota governor made his money as a software entrepreneur, selling his business to Microsoft for more than $1 billion in 2001. The latest federal financial disclosures show his personal holdings to include assets with ranges that exceed $100 million but do not provide a precise value of his net worth. Disclosure forms also do not require him to include certain trusts if Burgum himself is not the beneficiary. Burgum impressed Trump during his own failed bid for the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination. As interior secretary, Burgum will be charged with implementing Trump’s “Drill, baby, drill” promise — making it even easier for energy companies to tap fossil fuel resources, including from public lands. Forbes has not yet identified Bessent as a billionaire, but the veteran hedge fund manager confirmed Monday as treasury secretary certainly is worth many hundreds of millions. At Treasury, he will play key roles in selling and implementing a number of Trump’s signature policies: reinstating the 2017 tax cuts tilted to corporations and wealthy individuals, imposing tariffs on many imports and cutting taxes on overtime wages, Social Security benefits and tip income. Reich, the former labor secretary, noted that Bessent and his fellow wealthy Cabinet designees stand to benefit personally from Trump’s tax ideas. Trump tax policies, which helped widen the deficit in Trump’s first term, are juxtaposed with Bessent’s warnings about the dangers of rising U.S. debt and the cost of annual interest payments to the government’s bond holders. An apparent runner-up to head Treasury, Lutnick (estimated net worth $1.5 billion) has been nominated to be secretary of commerce. Lutnick, who made his fortune as a financial services executive, is still slated for a high-profile post that will put him at the center of Trump’s promised trade wars with China and other nations, including Mexico and Canada. Commerce also oversees several agencies, including the Census Bureau, whose calculations are key to determining the funding distributions of programs across the federal government. The Georgia businesswoman named to lead the Small Business Administration was the wealthiest member of the Senate during her brief stay on Capitol Hill. Loeffler is married to Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, the publicly traded firm that owns the New York Stock Exchange. That’s not the center of commerce for the SBA’s usual clientele. The agency was founded in 1953 and describes itself as “the only cabinet-level federal agency fully dedicated to small business” by providing “counseling, capital, and contracting expertise as the nation’s only go-to resource and voice for small businesses.” As a senator, Loeffler faced ethics complaints over alleged insider trading tied to stock trades she and her husband made as members of Congress first started receiving briefings related to the coronavirus pandemic. The trades occurred weeks before the pandemic caused markets to plummet. Justice Department and Senate inquiries later found no wrongdoing on Loeffler’s part. Isaacman, another financial services billionaire, was the first wealthy individual to take a space walk through Musk’s company, SpaceX. This choice, as much as any, illustrates Trump’s lean to the wealthy private sector, given that billionaires like Musk and Amazon chief Jeff Bezos are now competing in a space sector that was once the province of the federal government and the agency that Isaacman would lead as NASA administrator. __ An earlier version of this story erroneously stated that Doug Burgum has an estimated net worth of $1.1 billion. The latest federal financial disclosures show his personal holdings to include assets with ranges that exceed $100 million but do not provide a precise value of his net worth.  \n \n  \n \n Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

At Treasury, he will play key roles in selling and implementing a number of Trump’s signature policies: reinstating the 2017 tax cuts tilted to corporations and wealthy individuals, imposing tariffs on many imports and cutting taxes on overtime wages, Social Security benefits and tip income.\n\nReich, the former labor secretary, noted that Bessent and his fellow wealthy Cabinet designees stand to benefit personally from Trump’s tax ideas. Trump tax policies, which helped widen the deficit in Trump’s first term, are juxtaposed with Bessent’s warnings about the dangers of rising U.S. debt and the cost of annual interest payments to the government’s bond holders.\n\nAn apparent runner-up to head Treasury, Lutnick (estimated net worth $1.5 billion) has been nominated to be secretary of commerce. Lutnick, who made his fortune as a financial services executive, is still slated for a high-profile post that will put him at the center of Trump’s promised trade wars with China and other nations, including Mexico and Canada. Commerce also oversees several agencies, including the Census Bureau, whose calculations are key to determining the funding distributions of programs across the federal government.\n\nThe Georgia businesswoman named to lead the Small Business Administration was the wealthiest member of the Senate during her brief stay on Capitol Hill. Loeffler is married to Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, the publicly traded firm that owns the New York Stock Exchange. That’s not the center of commerce for the SBA’s usual clientele. The agency was founded in 1953 and describes itself as “the only cabinet-level federal agency fully dedicated to small business” by providing “counseling, capital, and contracting expertise as the nation’s only go-to resource and voice for small businesses.” As a senator, Loeffler faced ethics complaints over alleged insider trading tied to stock trades she and her husband made as members of Congress first started receiving briefings related to the coronavirus pandemic. The trades occurred weeks before the pandemic caused markets to plummet. Justice Department and Senate inquiries later found no wrongdoing on Loeffler’s part.\n\nIsaacman, another financial services billionaire, was the first wealthy individual to take a space walk through Musk’s company, SpaceX. This choice, as much as any, illustrates Trump’s lean to the wealthy private sector, given that billionaires like Musk and Amazon chief Jeff Bezos are now competing in a space sector that was once the province of the federal government and the agency that Isaacman would lead as NASA administrator.\n\nAn earlier version of this story erroneously stated that Doug Burgum has an estimated net worth of $1.1 billion. The latest federal financial disclosures show his personal holdings to include assets with ranges that exceed $100 million but do not provide a precise value of his net worth.",

    "text": "I played a fictional billionaire on TV. It’s time world leaders got serious about taxing the real ones You could be forgiven for thinking the second coming of Donald Trump was fiction. Unfortunately, it’s not – the threat he and his “broligarchs” bring to people around the world is very, very real. Last month Trump, surrounded by his uber-rich friends,  was inaugurated the 47th president, while his political supporters sat outside in the cold – the perfect metaphor for who really matters in this presidency. Among the clique were the three richest men in the world: Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and top dog Elon Musk, who personally poured $277m into Trump’s election campaign, increasing his own wealth by $170bn as a result. Money equals power, so the saying goes, and right now it’s playing out on the world stage. As we know, Musk’s efforts to get Trump into the White House earned him a role heading up the new department of government efficiency – or Doge for short, conveniently echoing the same name of the cryptocurrency he promotes. A man born into wealth and privilege is advising the president on how the US should protect its cash, alongside about a dozen other billionaire officials. Meanwhile, the rest of the world lives in economic fear as the gap between the super-rich and everyone else quickly becomes a chasm. These super-rich people are so far out of touch with reality, it’s infuriating. Wealth is no longer about financial worth, it’s about control – of our democracies, societies, economies and planet. Trump’s appointees are just the latest example of how inequality and extreme wealth hurt us all. Billionaire wealth rose three times faster in 2024 than in 2023. Five trillionaires are now expected within a decade, according to data from Oxfam. Meanwhile, progress on global poverty has stalled. Inequality is out of control. On his first day back at the White House, Trump signed a slew of executive orders, winding back the clock of progress with every signature. He said he would only be a dictator on day one. Time will tell. Soon after, he took centre stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos among heads of state, politicians and business moguls who had jetted in for the annual conference at God knows what cost to finances and the environment. Trump appeared by video link and spent much of the time making bossy demands and threats, like a scene from The Apprentice. Once again, this is not TV. This is real life. His decisions affect us all. I’m someone who has lived with both poverty and wealth – but increasingly people from my working-class background will not be given the opportunities afforded to me. Because wealth is becoming more concentrated, cronyism is growing and the rest of the world is suffering. Some at least are calling it out. Last month, nearly 400 millionaires and billionaires signed a letter asking leaders at Davos to take action on extreme wealth – by taxing the super-rich, like them. And, in his farewell speech, the then US president, Joe Biden, warned of a dangerous oligarchy taking shape. This should be a wake-up call to us all – especially those people elected to represent us. Governments must address the obscene political capture we are witnessing. One simple way to do this is to tax the super-rich. These people now manage so much more than money. They manage what we read, what we watch, the information we’re given and, ultimately, how we vote. Last year, the EU Tax Observatory estimated that a 2% tax on billionaires could raise up to $250bn a year. About 3,000 people would pay it, and it would make very little difference to their lives. For everyone else, though, it would begin to rein in extreme wealth and fight back against the rising inequality that is damaging lives across the world. When a super-rich elite is determining the outcome of elections purely to protect their vested interests and accelerate profits, it’s clear that we are in a terrifying age of wealth extremism. Our leaders have lacked the backbone needed to rein in political capture and put ordinary people first. This cannot continue. It’s time for us to look closely at what’s happening, at how Trump is making a terrible situation even worse – and finally resolve to draw the line.

    "domain": "fortune.com",
    "text": "Preston Fore is a reporter on Fortune's Success team. Baby Boomers are trying to figure out what to do with their wealth: Give it to their kids now, or wait until they pass on.  It’s a nice problem to have, surely, but when it concerns the $80 trillion Great Wealth Transfer the indecision could have major ramifications for both heirs and the rest of the U.S. economy. One study found that for many Boomers, the question has already been decided: Hurry up and wait, kids.\n\n\n\n \n Nearly half of high-net-worth Baby Boomers—people between the ages of 60 and 79 with more than $1 million in investable assets—say they plan to hold onto their wealth during their lifetime, according to a recent survey from Charles Schwab. Between rising healthcare costs and living longer, Boomer respondents say they plan to hold onto their wealth for longer.\n\n\n\n That’s in stark contrast to the nearly 97% of Gen Xers and Millennials who say they will share their wealth while they’re still alive.  \n One reason for Boomers’ view on their wealth has to do with innovative financial advice, says Susan Hirshman, director of wealth management for Schwab Wealth Advisory and Schwab Center for Financial Research. With an emphasis on goal-based financial planning, she says, young generations know if they will have a wealth surplus—and then can consider what to do with it earlier.\n\n\n\n “A financial plan is a living, breathing tool,” Hirshamn says. “It needs to be evaluated on a consistent basis, and as life changes, your plan may have to change and adapt to those changing needs.”\n\n\n\n Younger generations stand to benefit the most from the Great Wealth Transfer, but the latest Schwab High Net Worth Investor Survey indicates that high-net-worth Millennials and Gen Xers are more than twice as likely to share their wealth with the next generation during their lifetime as compared to Boomers.\n\n\n\n This could be tied to the fact that younger generations are more cognizant of the wealth disparities in the U.S. and around the world. At age 35, the wealthiest millennials tend to have more money than their baby boomer counterparts, and the poorest have less, according to a study from the American Journal of Sociology.\n\n\n\n The total billionaire wealth increased by $2 trillion in 2024 alone—and each billionaire’s wealth grew about $2 million per day on average, according to Oxfam. The year also brought 204 newly minted billionaires, equating to about four new per week. In the next decade, the organization predicts there will be five trillionaires. \n Even members of the ultra-rich agree that wealth issues are out of hand. Bill Gates, one of the wealthiest individuals on Earth, called for increased taxes on the rich—so far as to say he would support a tax that would reduce his wealth by over $100 billion. Gates, along with dozens of other ultra-rich individuals, pledged to donate a majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\n\n\n Schwab’s data suggests that the Great Wealth Transfer will go slower than anticipated, but most wealthy Americans believe that sharing some wealth while they are alive is important so they can financially support their families, share in their joy, and make memories together. \n\n\n\n However, a majority are planning to only distribute about 40% of their assets while living—leaving the rest to pass on after their passing. Only about a quarter of Americans with children have had discussions about generational wealth, and even those who do, communication is often limited and inconclusive, according to research from Edward Jones.\n\n\n\n Hirshman says being open about estate planning sooner rather than later will lead to less headache for families during a time that should be dedicated to grieving and remembrance.\n\n\n\n “By having those conversations early, explaining what's going to happen, who to call, where the documents are, right, what the resources are, what the plan is, how we thought about everything,” says Hirshman. “It allows for calmer, controlled execution of the estate plan.” \n The good news is that the younger generations are already listening. Sixty-three percent of wealthy individuals are starting to plan before they turn 45 years old. To transfer wealth appropriately, Hirshman says, it starts with playing the ‘what if’ game. Before over-transferring, one should consider questions like: What if your healthcare costs are extreme? What if you live to 100?\n\n\n\n Above all, she encourages individuals to engage in effective communication, consistent reviews of financial plans—both in terms of taxes and family dynamics—and honest conversations about responsibilities. For example, who is the executor or trustee, or does outside help need to be brought in?\n\n\n\n Younger generations also plan to attach more strings to their wealth. While 97% of millennials plan to have some kind of stipulation to their money transfer, only 34% of Boomers care. Overall, Hirshman says conversations about wealth transfer are not about only keeping or only giving—it’s about doing both, responsibly.\n  © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

    "text": "President-elect tapping mega-rich backers for positions that will give them power to cut spending on public services Enough billionaires and multimillionaires have been assembled by Donald Trump to fill key roles in his nascent administration to form a soccer team. In a recruitment process that appears to mock his campaign’s appeal to working-class voters, the president-elect has brazenly tapped a gallery of mega-rich backers for key positions that, in some instances, will give them power to cut spending on public services that are used by the most poor and vulnerable. At least 11 picks for strategic positions after Trump returns to the White House in January have either achieved billionaire status themselves, have billionaire spouses or are within touching distance of that threshold. The net result will be the wealthiest administration in US history – worth a total of $340bn at the start of this week, before Trump further boosted its monetary value by trying to appoint at least three more billionaires. Its collective wealth easily outstrips that of Trump’s first cabinet, formed after his 2016 election victory – which at the time was the richest US cabinet ever formed, containing such super-rich members as Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of ExxonMobil, who was appointed secretary of state, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, who had become wealthy through restructuring bankrupt companies. It also throws into stark relief the relative impoverishment of the current cabinet of Joe Biden – collectively worth a relatively paltry $118m despite having been repeatedly derided by Trump as representative of a corrupt governing elite that was cheating ordinary working Americans. The wealthiest – and most prominent – of Trump’s 2024 class is Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur who is the world’s richest man. Along with Vivek Ramaswamy, another tech entrepreneur who is said to be worth at least $1bn, Musk has been tapped to spearhead a newly created department of government efficiency, already known by its acronym Doge, whose mission is to cut waste from public spending. The conspicuously extravagant Musk has pledged to cut $2tn from the national budget. He has not explained how or over what period, although he has warned that it may entail “temporary economic hardships”. Neither Musk nor Ramaswamy will need Senate confirmation, since Doge is not an official government department or agency. However, Trump has not shied away from nominating billionaire cabinet members who will have to undergo public Senate hearings at which their wealth may become an issue. These include Linda McMahon, the nominee for education secretary – and a former World Wrestling Entertainment executive – whose husband, Vince McMahon, is worth an estimated $3bn; the North Dakota governor and former businessman Doug Burgum, designated to be secretary of the interior; Howard Lutnick, the chair and chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, who has been nominated as commerce secretary; and Scott Bessent, a hedge-fund manager and former partner at Soros Investment Management, who has been nominated as treasury secretary. Their collective worth alone amounts to $10.7bn – $4.5bn more than Trump’s first cabinet. Others subject to Senate confirmation are Charles Kushner – a property tycoon and father of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner – the prospective ambassador to Paris; Warren Stephens, head of an investment bank and chosen as ambassador to London; Jared Isaacman, a commercial astronaut and entrepreneur who has been nominated to head the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa); and Kelly Loeffler, a former GOP senator and joint head of Trump’s inaugural committee, now his choice to head the Small Business Administration. All fall under the billionaire bracket either individually or through marital or family links, according to Forbes. So, too, does Steve Witkoff, another property tycoon and golfing partner of Trump, who has chosen him as his Middle East envoy. Witkoff’s net worth has been estimated at $1bn. Then there is Frank Bisignano, nominated as head of the Social Security Administration, where he would be responsible for managing the pensions and benefits of the country’s retirees. The president of Fiserv Inc, a Wisconsin-based financial technology firm, his current wealth is estimated at around $974m. The president-elect has reportedly offered the deputy defence secretary slot to yet another billionaire, Stephen Feinberg, a private equity investor and co-chair of Cerberus Capital Management, whose personal worth as of July this year was assessed at $4.8bn. It is not known whether Feinberg has accepted. The gulf between Trump’s taste for the wealthy and his populist everyman rhetoric has not gone unnoticed. Analysts have long noted the ability of a politician who proudly flaunts his own self-proclaimed billionaire status to tap into popular resentment over stagnating incomes and living standards – accentuated by his laments over the loss of industrial jobs and trade deals that he says have harmed American workers. “According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, working-class Americans’ real wages have stagnated or declined since the early 1980s, especially as industries moved jobs overseas,” wrote Matthew King, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund, in a blog post. “This may help explain Trump’s working class appeal.” Trump, King argued, could exploit working-class anxieties because he “knew that pride in God, family, and country would resonate in a way that the progressive messages of other candidates didn’t”. David Kass, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, said the goal of what he called Trump’s “government by the billionaires for the billionaires” was huge tax cuts for the super-rich, which would be achieved at the cost of slashing services such as education, social security and Medicaid, which provides healthcare for those with lower incomes. “Voters wanted a change,” Kass said. “I think what’s going to happen is that people will say, that’s not actually what I wanted. The rich are rich enough and don’t need more tax cuts. How about helping me? I think there’s going to be a huge mobilisation against this [tax cut].” But King warned that Trump’s emotional resonance may override envy of the rich. “I still believe that Trump’s working-class appeal will continue to enable him to exploit the working class successfully while funnelling the rewards to the new oligarchy: big businesses and billionaires like Elon Musk,” he wrote.",

    "text": "Billionaires and wealthy consumers are going bold—from opting for loud fashion choices, to making flashy public appearances. It’s a far cry from the popular “quiet luxury” trend of muted colors and nonexistent logos that’s dominated for years in an attempt to hide wealth and power.  At this year’s New York Fashion Week events, attendees were starting to break from the mold of quiet luxury. The looks weren’t exclusively understated—bolder prints, luxe fabrics, and even fur pieces were spotted on and off the runway from top designers such as Michael Kors, Coach, and Carolina Herrera. This change in consumer tastes reflect a growing hunger for individuality. “There are two tracks in this luxury trend: There’s a quiet version, there’s a loud version,” Chandler Mount, founder of Affluent Consumer Research Company, told Fortune. America’s billionaires and corporate elite are getting bolder, which could be empowering the luxury shopping class to do the same. CEOs are stepping out of the shadows and into the limelight—a prime example being this year’s presidential inauguration, attended by tech leaders Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Tim Cook. It’s unusual for titans of industry to attend the event, let alone be seated in front of the incoming president’s chief staffers. Jeff Bezos’ wife Lauren Sánchez also made a splash by wearing a daring white bralette peeping from her low-cut pantsuit.  CEOs once lead without drawing too much attention to themselves for the sake of their companies, but that is no longer the case. Billionaires are getting bolder, mirroring wealthy society’s growing desire for individuality and expression—especially in fashion. Sturdy, hand-dyed cotton shirts and satin skirts can get boring, just like making big business moves in the background. Billionaires are no longer as inconspicuous as they once were. Tech CEOs have become entertaining personalities that the public tunes into each week. The likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk all rose to prominence as unassuming, hoodie-wearing tech-bros. Now, they’ve leaned into high-flying, leather jacket-wearing, public-facing personas.  Zuckerberg has hosted livestreams to chat with online users, is lobbying at the U.S. capitol, and trailed behind an MMA fighter walking into the sports area. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos lounges on his $500 million megayacht, fielded the public questions for who should star in his studio’s upcoming movie, and is photographed donning edgier looks alongside his manicured wife. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is no exception to the trend. He towered above President Donald Trump giving press briefings in the White House, wielded a chainsaw at a conservative conference, and went onstage at Dave Chappelle’s comedy show.  This behavior is a far cry from the likes of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Both tech leaders were billionaires and pioneers of industry, but didn’t radiate an energy of grandeur. They didn’t make grandiose public appearances, or tried to spur attention towards themselves. Oftentimes, the CEOs only stepped into the spotlight to promote and demo their products: like the iPhone, or Microsoft Windows software. They certainly weren’t being loud—and didn’t seem to crave that. But a shift has taken place in corporate America and amongst the country’s 1%. Wealthy individuals are turning to bold expression. This trend is reflected in ways rich people are expressing status—and themselves.   Mirroring the attitudes of forward-facing billionaires, more people are moving away from inconspicuous styling to loud expression.  “The time has come, and the next generation of luxury consumers is here. That 18 to 34-year-old consumer group is constantly redefining luxury, because they are the primary buyers of it,” Mount said. “They’re looking for more expression in what they’re wearing. They want people to learn something about them by what they wear.” Quiet luxury initially rose as a style staple when many consumers were disillusioned with flashy branding and fast fashion—and it became the new “stealth” signifier of wealth. But the tables may have turned again, and people want to stand out; at this year’s New York Fashion week, fashion photographer and writer Simbarashe Cha noticed a turn in the tides of quiet luxury.  Read more from Fortune   Cha noted that show-goers and models were rocking new trends: an abundance of fur coats, animal prints, exaggerated silhouettes, and layered textures. The looks were subversive to the navy and all-black styles people were donning just a couple years before. Cha said that fashion is turning loud again—and certainly, some boundaries are being broken. John Rogers, a U.S. fashion designer who has styled the likes of Zendaya and Gigi Hadid, has also witnessed the shift. His clothing combines that quiet luxury timelessness and quality with rich color and patterns. Behind the scenes of his New York Fashion Week show this year, he spoke withBBC about divergence from the plainness of quiet luxury.  “We want newness; we want transformation,” Rogers said. “But we have to be willing to try some fresh approaches. We have to make people excited to get dressed again, to use clothes as a tool for hope… Even if you’re just wearing them to go down the street for coffee.” Emma Burleigh is a reporter at Fortune, covering success, careers, entrepreneurship, and personal finance.

    "text": "How to be a billionaire and pay no taxes Listen to more stories on the  Noa app. This is Work in Progress, a newsletter about work, technology, and how to solve some of America’s biggest problems. Sign up here. America’s superrich have always found ways to avoid paying taxes, but in recent years, they’ve discovered what might be the mother of all loopholes. It’s a three-step process called “Buy, Borrow, Die,” and it allows people to amass a huge fortune, spend as much of it as they want, and pass the rest—untaxed—on to their heirs. The technique is so cleverly designed that the standard wish list of progressive tax reforms would leave it completely intact. Step one: buy. The average American derives most of their disposable income from the wages they earn working a job, but the superrich are different. They amass their fortune by buying and owning assets that appreciate. Elon Musk hasn’t taken a traditional salary as CEO of Tesla since 2019; Warren Buffett, the chair of Berkshire Hathaway, has famously kept his salary at $100,000 for more than 40 years. Their wealth consists almost entirely of stock in the companies they’ve built or invested in. The tax-law scholars Edward Fox and Zachary Liscow found that even when you exclude the 400 wealthiest individuals in America, the remaining members of the top 1 percent hold $23 trillion in assets. Unlike wages, which are taxed the moment they are earned, assets are taxed only at the moment they are sold—or, in tax terms, “realized.” The justification for this approach is that unrealized assets exist only on paper; you can’t pay for a private jet or buy a company with stocks, even if they have appreciated by billions of dollars. In theory, the rich will eventually need to sell their assets for cash, at which point they will pay taxes on their increase in wealth. That theory would be much closer to reality if not for step two: borrow. Instead of selling their assets to make major purchases, the superrich can use them as collateral to secure loans, which, because they must eventually be repaid, are also not considered taxable income. Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle and America’s fourth-richest person, has pledged more than $30 billion of his company’s stock as collateral in order to fund his lavish lifestyle, which includes building a $270 million yacht, buying a $300 million island, and purchasing an $80 million mansion. A Forbes analysis found that, as of April 2022, Musk had pledged Tesla shares worth more than $94 billion, which “serve as an evergreen credit facility, giving Musk access to cash when he needs it.” This strategy isn’t as common among the merely very rich, who may not have the expensive tastes that Ellison and Musk do, but it isn’t rare either. Liscow and Fox calculated that the top 1 percent of wealth-holders, excluding the richest 400 Americans, borrowed more than $1 trillion in 2022. And the approach appears to be gaining momentum. Last year, The Economist reported that, at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America alone, the value of “securities-backed loans” increased from $80 billion in 2018 to almost $150 billion in 2022. “The real question is: Why would you not borrow hundreds of millions, even billions, to fund the lifestyle you want to live?” Tom Anderson, a wealth-management consultant and former banker who specializes in these loans, told me. “This is such an easy tool to use. And the tax benefits are massive.” Annie Lowrey: Trump says his tax plan won’t benefit the rich—he’s exactly wrong You might think this couldn’t possibly go on forever. Eventually, the rich will need to sell off some of their assets to pay back the loan. That brings us to step three: die. According to a provision of the tax code known as “stepped-up basis”—or, more evocatively, the “angel of death” loophole—when an individual dies, the value that their assets gained during their lifetime becomes immune to taxation. Those assets can then be sold by the billionaire’s heirs to pay off any outstanding loans without them having to worry about taxes. The justification for the stepped-up-basis rule is that the United States already levies a 40 percent inheritance tax on fortunes larger than $14 million, and it would be unfair to tax assets twice. In practice, however, a seemingly infinite number of loopholes allow the rich to avoid paying this tax, many of which involve placing assets in byzantine legal trusts that enable them to be passed seamlessly from one generation to the next. “Only morons pay the estate tax,” Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive and the then–chief economic adviser to Donald Trump, memorably remarked in 2017. “All of this is completely, perfectly legal,” Edward McCaffery, the scholar who coined the term Buy, Borrow, Die, told me. But, he said, the strategy “has basically killed the entire concept of an income tax for the wealthiest individuals.” The tax economist Daniel Reck, who has spent his career documenting the various ways the rich evade taxation, told me that Buy, Borrow, Die is “the most important tax-avoidance strategy today.” The result is a two-tiered tax system: one for the many, who earn their income through wages and pay taxes, and another for the few, who accumulate wealth through paper assets and largely do not pay taxes. Much of the debate around American tax policy focuses on the income-tax rate paid by the very wealthiest Americans. But the bulk of those people’s fortunes doesn’t qualify as income in the first place. A 2021 ProPublica investigation of the private tax records of America’s 25 richest individuals found that they collectively paid an effective tax rate of just 3.4 percent on their total wealth gain from 2014 to 2018. Musk paid 3.3 percent, Jeff Bezos 1 percent, and Buffett—who has famously argued for imposing higher income-tax rates on the superrich—just 0.1 percent. The same dynamic exists, in slightly less egregious form, further down the wealth distribution. A 2021 White House study found that the 400 richest American households paid an effective tax rate of 8.2 percent on their total wealth gains from 2010 to 2018. Liscow and Fox found that, excluding the top 400, the rest of the 0.1 percent richest individuals paid an effective rate of 12 percent from 2004 to 2022. (Twelve percent is the income-tax rate paid by individuals who make $11,601 to $47,150 a year.) One solution to this basic unfairness would be to tax unrealized assets. In 2022, the Biden administration proposed a “billionaire minimum tax” that would have placed a new annual levy of up to 20 percent on the appreciation of even unsold assets for households with more than $100 million in wealth. Experts have vehemently debated the substantive merits of such a policy; the real problem, however, is political. According to a survey conducted by Liscow and Fox, most Americans oppose a tax on unrealized gains even when applied only to the richest individuals. The Joe Biden proposal, perhaps unsurprisingly, went nowhere in Congress. Making matters more complicated, even if such a policy did pass, the Supreme Court would very likely rule it unconstitutional. James Kwak: The tax code for the ultra-rich vs. the one for everyone else A second idea would be to address the “borrow” step. Last year, Liscow and Fox published a proposal to tax the borrowing of households worth more than $100 million, which they estimated would raise about $10 billion a year. The limitation of that solution, as the authors acknowledge, is that it would not address the larger pool of rich Americans who don’t borrow heavily against their assets but do take advantage of stepped-up basis. That leaves the “die” step. Tax experts from across the political spectrum generally support eliminating the “stepped-up basis” rule, allowing unrealized assets to be taxed at death. This would be far more politically palatable than the dead-on-arrival billionaire’s minimum tax: In the same survey in which respondents overwhelmingly opposed broad taxes on unrealized assets during life, Liscow and Fox also found that nearly two-thirds of them supported taxing unrealized assets at death. Even a change this widely supported, however, would run up against the iron law of democratic politics: Policies with concentrated benefits and distributed costs are very hard to overturn. That’s especially true when the benefits just so happen to be concentrated among the richest, most powerful people in the country. In fact, the Biden administration did propose eliminating stepped-up basis as part of its Build Back Better legislation. The move prompted an intense backlash from special-interest groups and their allied politicians, with opponents portraying the provision as an assault on rural America that would destroy family farms and businesses. These claims were completely unfounded—the bill had specific exemptions for family businesses and applied only to assets greater than $2.5 million—but the effort succeeded at riling up enough Democratic opposition to kill the idea. The one guarantee of any tax regime is that, eventually, the rich and powerful will learn how to game it. In theory, a democratic system, operating on behalf of the majority, should be able to respond by making adjustments that force the rich to pay their fair share. But in a world where money readily translates to political power, voice, and influence, the superrich have virtually endless resources at their disposal to make sure that doesn’t happen. To make society more equal, you need to tax the rich. But to tax the rich, it helps for society to be more equal. TheAtlantic.com © 2025 The Atlantic Monthly Group. All Rights Reserved.

    "onlytext": "America’s superrich have always found ways to avoid paying taxes, but in recent years, they’ve discovered what might be the mother of all loopholes. It’s a three-step process called “Buy, Borrow, Die,” and it allows people to amass a huge fortune, spend as much of it as they want, and pass the rest—untaxed—on to their heirs. The technique is so cleverly designed that the standard wish list of progressive tax reforms would leave it completely intact.\n\nStep one: buy. The average American derives most of their disposable income from the wages they earn working a job, but the superrich are different. They amass their fortune by buying and owning assets that appreciate. Elon Musk hasn’t taken a traditional salary as CEO of Tesla since 2019; Warren Buffett, the chair of Berkshire Hathaway, has famously kept his salary at $100,000 for more than 40 years. Their wealth consists almost entirely of stock in the companies they’ve built or invested in. The tax-law scholars Edward Fox and Zachary Liscow found that even when you exclude the 400 wealthiest individuals in America, the remaining members of the top 1 percent hold $23 trillion in assets. Unlike wages, which are taxed the moment they are earned, assets are taxed only at the moment they are sold—or, in tax terms, “realized.” The justification for this approach is that unrealized assets exist only on paper; you can’t pay for a private jet or buy a company with stocks, even if they have appreciated by billions of dollars. In theory, the rich will eventually need to sell their assets for cash, at which point they will pay taxes on their increase in wealth.\n\nThat theory would be much closer to reality if not for step two: borrow. Instead of selling their assets to make major purchases, the superrich can use them as collateral to secure loans, which, because they must eventually be repaid, are also not considered taxable income. Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle and America’s fourth-richest person, has pledged more than $30 billion of his company’s stock as collateral in order to fund his lavish lifestyle, which includes building a $270 million yacht, buying a $300 million island, and purchasing an $80 million mansion. A Forbes analysis found that, as of April 2022, Musk had pledged Tesla shares worth more than $94 billion, which “serve as an evergreen credit facility, giving Musk access to cash when he needs it.” This strategy isn’t as common among the merely very rich, who may not have the expensive tastes that Ellison and Musk do, but it isn’t rare either. Liscow and Fox calculated that the top 1 percent of wealth-holders, excluding the richest 400 Americans, borrowed more than $1 trillion in 2022. And the approach appears to be gaining momentum. Last year, The Economist reported that, at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America alone, the value of “securities-backed loans” increased from $80 billion in 2018 to almost $150 billion in 2022. “The real question is: Why would you not borrow hundreds of millions, even billions, to fund the lifestyle you want to live?” Tom Anderson, a wealth-management consultant and former banker who specializes in these loans, told me. “This is such an easy tool to use. And the tax benefits are massive.”\n\nYou might think this couldn’t possibly go on forever. Eventually, the rich will need to sell off some of their assets to pay back the loan. That brings us to step three: die. According to a provision of the tax code known as “stepped-up basis”—or, more evocatively, the “angel of death” loophole—when an individual dies, the value that their assets gained during their lifetime becomes immune to taxation. Those assets can then be sold by the billionaire’s heirs to pay off any outstanding loans without them having to worry about taxes. The justification for the stepped-up-basis rule is that the United States already levies a 40 percent inheritance tax on fortunes larger than $14 million, and it would be unfair to tax assets twice. In practice, however, a seemingly infinite number of loopholes allow the rich to avoid paying this tax, many of which involve placing assets in byzantine legal trusts that enable them to be passed seamlessly from one generation to the next. “Only morons pay the estate tax,” Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive and the then–chief economic adviser to Donald Trump, memorably remarked in 2017. “All of this is completely, perfectly legal,” Edward McCaffery, the scholar who coined the term Buy, Borrow, Die, told me. But, he said, the strategy “has basically killed the entire concept of an income tax for the wealthiest individuals.” The tax economist Daniel Reck, who has spent his career documenting the various ways the rich evade taxation, told me that Buy, Borrow, Die is “the most important tax-avoidance strategy today.”\n\nThe result is a two-tiered tax system: one for the many, who earn their income through wages and pay taxes, and another for the few, who accumulate wealth through paper assets and largely do not pay taxes. Much of the debate around American tax policy focuses on the income-tax rate paid by the very wealthiest Americans. But the bulk of those people’s fortunes doesn’t qualify as income in the first place. A 2021 ProPublica investigation of the private tax records of America’s 25 richest individuals found that they collectively paid an effective tax rate of just 3.4 percent on their total wealth gain from 2014 to 2018. Musk paid 3.3 percent, Jeff Bezos 1 percent, and Buffett—who has famously argued for imposing higher income-tax rates on the superrich—just 0.1 percent. The same dynamic exists, in slightly less egregious form, further down the wealth distribution. A 2021 White House study found that the 400 richest American households paid an effective tax rate of 8.2 percent on their total wealth gains from 2010 to 2018. Liscow and Fox found that, excluding the top 400, the rest of the 0.1 percent richest individuals paid an effective rate of 12 percent from 2004 to 2022. (Twelve percent is the income-tax rate paid by individuals who make $11,601 to $47,150 a year.)\n\nOne solution to this basic unfairness would be to tax unrealized assets. In 2022, the Biden administration proposed a “billionaire minimum tax” that would have placed a new annual levy of up to 20 percent on the appreciation of even unsold assets for households with more than $100 million in wealth. Experts have vehemently debated the substantive merits of such a policy; the real problem, however, is political. According to a survey conducted by Liscow and Fox, most Americans oppose a tax on unrealized gains even when applied only to the richest individuals. The Joe Biden proposal, perhaps unsurprisingly, went nowhere in Congress. Making matters more complicated, even if such a policy did pass, the Supreme Court would very likely rule it unconstitutional.\n\nA second idea would be to address the “borrow” step. Last year, Liscow and Fox published a proposal to tax the borrowing of households worth more than $100 million, which they estimated would raise about $10 billion a year. The limitation of that solution, as the authors acknowledge, is that it would not address the larger pool of rich Americans who don’t borrow heavily against their assets but do take advantage of stepped-up basis.\n\nThat leaves the “die” step. Tax experts from across the political spectrum generally support eliminating the “stepped-up basis” rule, allowing unrealized assets to be taxed at death. This would be far more politically palatable than the dead-on-arrival billionaire’s minimum tax: In the same survey in which respondents overwhelmingly opposed broad taxes on unrealized assets during life, Liscow and Fox also found that nearly two-thirds of them supported taxing unrealized assets at death. Even a change this widely supported, however, would run up against the iron law of democratic politics: Policies with concentrated benefits and distributed costs are very hard to overturn. That’s especially true when the benefits just so happen to be concentrated among the richest, most powerful people in the country. In fact, the Biden administration did propose eliminating stepped-up basis as part of its Build Back Better legislation. The move prompted an intense backlash from special-interest groups and their allied politicians, with opponents portraying the provision as an assault on rural America that would destroy family farms and businesses. These claims were completely unfounded—the bill had specific exemptions for family businesses and applied only to assets greater than $2.5 million—but the effort succeeded at riling up enough Democratic opposition to kill the idea.\n\nThe one guarantee of any tax regime is that, eventually, the rich and powerful will learn how to game it. In theory, a democratic system, operating on behalf of the majority, should be able to respond by making adjustments that force the rich to pay their fair share. But in a world where money readily translates to political power, voice, and influence, the superrich have virtually endless resources at their disposal to make sure that doesn’t happen. To make society more equal, you need to tax the rich. But to tax the rich, it helps for society to be more equal.",

    "text": "“California used to be the Golden State. Now it’s rusted and destroyed,” says energy drinks magnate Russ Weiner. In a way, the state’s flush with gold; California is a treasure trove of extreme wealth. But some of its most affluent residents, including Weiner (worth an estimated $4.8 billion as of the date of publishing), have also been moving away, Forbes finds in a 20-year analysis of the annual Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. California has consistently been home to more members of The Forbes 400 than any other state, and now has 87. But that’s six fewer than two decades ago. Plenty of California-based tech tycoons moved on and off the list over the years as their fortunes fluctuated with the stock market, but some disappeared because billionaires just up and left. Over the past 20 years, while gaining new Forbes 400 residents, California lost 19 of them to other states, particularly Texas, Nevada and Florida, where Rockstar Energy drink founder Weiner moved in 2009. What made him want to skip town? “Crime, homelessness, education, taxes,” he says. Oh, and Democrats.  Weiner is far from the only uber-wealthy entrepreneur who’s been chasing both rays and lower taxes. Florida and Texas, which have neither state income tax nor state capital gains tax, both saw dramatic 20-year upticks in residents who made the 400 list. Texas went from 36 to 45, a 25% jump, while Florida — stunningly — doubled from 23 to 46 members of the list. Most of the increase in Florida came from Forbes 400 members moving there. That includes the likes of hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin, a former longtime resident of Chicago, who also relocated his firm Citadel to Miami because he said it offered a better corporate environment; Paychex founder Tom Golisano, who said he was escaping New York’s high taxes when he moved to Naples in 2009; Charles B. Johnson, who moved to Palm Beach from California after retiring from money management firm Franklin Resources; and Thomas Peterffy of Interactive Brokers, who left Connecticut around 2015, also for Palm Beach. An outsized number of the last decade’s Florida transplants came from the northeastern elite enclaves of New York, Connecticut and Illinois, and most made their fortunes in finance and investments. A far smaller amount of the list’s new Floridians created fortunes in the Sunshine State from the start, like Nick Caporella, whose National Beverage makes the popular La Croix bubbly water. The picture is much dimmer in the Midwest, which has been shedding the extremely wealthy. The number of richest Americans there dropped 42% over the past two decades, from 73 to 42, mostly because Heartland billionaires’ fortunes decreased or didn’t keep pace with the rest of the country. (The cutoff to make the Forbes 400 rose from $600 million in 2003 to $2.9 billion in 2023.) But some just moved to warmer pastures, like movie producer Gigi Pritzker (who changed her permanent address from Chicago to California around 2019) or two heirs to the Walmart fortune (from Missouri to Texas and Nevada). And about 30% of Midwesterners on the 2003 and 2013 Forbes 400 lists have since dropped off because they passed away. In the last few years, that’s included iconic figures like Berkshire Hathaway’s Walter Scott Jr. (a former Omaha resident who was a close friend of Warren Buffett) and Chicago’s Sam Zell (forefather of the modern real estate investment trust), and a bit before them, William Ford Sr, the last grandchild of Henry Ford, who lived in Michigan. The manufacturing industry saw a particularly high number of drop-offs — paralleling the decades-long manufacturing decline in the Midwest — as did media, real estate and retail. Minnesota has been hit hardest. It ranked No. 9 among states with the most 400 members in 2003, when there were 11, but has now been completely drained out. A single family had an outsized impact on that decline. The clan behind the world’s biggest agriculture company, Cargill, used to be concentrated in the North Star State, where the business is still based. But Cargill’s old guard has died and the richest family members are now scattered across the country in Montana, Wisconsin, Missouri and California. This scenario — where a company’s big shareholders live far from the company itself — is actually not unusual. And it may be even more common these days in a place like Minnesota, says the Tax Foundation’s Jared Walczak. “Minnesota does very well with traditional C corporations,” says Walczak. “It’s high taxes, but those high taxes historically have not fallen very heavily on businesses, so it's been a very competitive place to operate your Fortune 500 company. But you also have a situation where states like this may be unattractive for the C-suites themselves,” perhaps in part because of those higher individual taxes. And in an increasingly mobile environment, he points out, not even high-level executives need to live where they work. Although taxes matter, Walczak and other analysts stress that it’s far from the only consideration for billionaires when it comes to planning where to live. It often isn’t even the top factor. “Many state lawmakers overestimate how sensitive rich people are to a few percentage points’ difference in the state tax rate,” says Carl Davis of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Richard Auxier of the Tax Policy Center agrees: “If you’re in West Virginia or Michigan and you think the taxes are the only thing that’s different about your state and Florida and Texas, I really need you to think a bit harder.”  Instead, the decision of where to live is hyper-personal, they say, noting that being closer to family is a frequent reason why billionaires move. The uber-wealthy also pursue top education systems, keeping in mind both their kids as well as their company workforces. Urban amenities are a big draw. So are safe neighborhoods, good infrastructure and centers of culture. The culture is what AriZona Iced Tea founder Don Vultaggio, raised in Brooklyn and worth an estimated $5.6 billion, loves about New York City. (Vultaggio now lives outside the city, in the Long Island enclave of Port Washington.) He remembers a conversation he once had with Andrew Cuomo: “‘Governor, businesses don’t mind paying taxes. We like it here. Museums, theater. It’s great.’” Many must agree, as the number of New Yorkers on the 400 shot up 27% over the past two decades, from 49 to 62. Extreme wealth has been consolidating in the United States. Back in 2003, the 10 states with the most 400 members had 275 of them; today, they have 297. Exactly 60% of the billionaires who made the list this year live in just four states: California, New York, Florida and Texas — the four states with the largest populations, together home to one third of all Americans. “The growing geographic concentration helps explain our populist politics these days,” says Darrell West, author of the 2014 book Billionaires: Reflections on the Upper Crust. “Much of the country is being left behind in terms of economic activity.” A handful of states — Maine, Delaware, North Dakota, New Mexico and Alaska — haven’t had a resident make The Forbes 400 list in at least two decades. On the other hand, the picture has been getting much rosier in places like Arizona and Georgia, which joined the top 10 states for the first time in 2014 (when the latter was tied with Maryland and Tennessee at 7 list members) and now ranks No. 6 with 10 Forbes 400 residents. Iowa and Kentucky both had no 400 members in 2003 and now each have one: Harry Stine (worth an estimated $8.8 billion, who joined the list in 2014), and Tamara Gustavson ($7.4 billion, 2011), respectively. This is also a great year for Mississippi, which made the list for only the second time in two decades. Joining the ranks of the richest are Hattiesburg’s Duff brothers, who are behind the holding company Duff Capital Investors, which owns construction, energy and trucking firms. “Mississippi is a good place to do business, mainly because of our people, who are hard-working, optimistic and dedicated to providing a better future for their families,” says Thomas Duff, who’s worth an estimated $3 billion. “Keeping a Mississippi-based operation for our companies has helped us stay true to our values.” Sitting at the very bottom of the Forbes wealth ranking is Alaska, which has never had a resident make the 400 list since it was first published in 1982. That does constitute a loss for the Last Frontier. “You would love to have billionaires living in your state,” says the Tax Policy Center’s Auxier, explaining that the attraction is not just tax revenue but also the companies the wealthy often start or bring. “Someone just sitting on their money, they’ll take them, they don’t want to lose them — but if you talk to someone in these states, what they really want is a billionaire who is participating in the economy and hopefully has businesses in the state.” Of course, there’s only so much a state can do to court the rich. With great wealth comes great mobility. The Americans with the deepest pockets will go where they want. ",

    "title": "Status Drives Millennials To Spend More On Luxury Goods. Is Conspicuous Consumption Coming Back?",
    "domain": "forbes.com",
    "text": "ByPamela N. Danziger, Senior Contributor. According to a new survey from Boston Consulting Group and Worth Media Group, affluent Millennials prioritize spending on luxury goods over experiences, challenging the popular notion that the next-generation is more experientially minded.  While Millennials indulge actively in luxury experiences – 54% spent on experiences in the past year – luxury goods take precedence, with 63% purchasing luxury goods. And 51% of Millennials expect to spend more on goods in the coming year, while 67% of GenXers and 80% of Boomers plan to spend less.  Underlying Millennials’ motivation for things over experiences is the status and prestige that come with them. A majority (54%) of Millennials surveyed are keen to display their wealth and accomplishments through luxury purchases and 70% are concerned about projecting the right image. And the status and prestige motivation was about 40% higher for Millennials than more mature consumers surveyed. “I was surprised by the scale and importance of status to the Millennials and it’s more important to them than across the other generations,” shared BCG’s Pierre Dupreelle, managing director, partner and one of the leads in its Fashion & Luxury practice. “The perception is Millennials are all about the experiences, but they are the generation spending most on status luxury goods.”  In other words, after going underground as the quiet luxury trend emerged post-pandemic, conspicuous consumption may be coming back with a vengeance now that Millennials (aged 28 to 43 years) are reaching the threshold where their incomes and wealth start to peak.  However, it won’t be as easy as slapping a bold logo on goods since nearly three-fourths of Millennials surveyed also expressed a desire for an “understated approach to my possessions and lifestyle.”  The BCG survey was conducted among 2,000 affluent Millennials (household income of $250k, and in high-cost cities over $350k, and $1 million or more net worth). It also included a comparative sample of 300 affluent GenXers and 300 affluent Baby Boomers. While Millennials give all the traditional reasons for purchasing luxury goods, like product quality reflected in materials and craftsmanship (79%), durability (78%) and value for money (69%), they are also driven strongly by other factors like brand recognition (70%), high ratings and review (70%) and scarcity (62%), which are far less significant to older generations. And sustainability (62%) and brand values or purpose (60%) also are more important for them than GenXers and Boomers. In typical surveys, it’s hard to tease out the importance of status since few people are willing to own up to wanting luxury goods to signal status and prestige, so the survey used a series of attitudinal questions to uncover that motivation.  Besides wanting to make an impression on others and to show off their wealth and success, Millennials have a strong desire to invest in themselves (87%) – hearkening to the classic L’Oréal slogan “Because I’m worth it” – and they are highly inclined to be influenced by public figures they consider role models (63%).  The reason why Millennials are more outer than inner-directed in their luxury purchases, as compared with older generations, may be down to one thing – social media. “This group grew up with social media, posting about how they look, what they wear, where they go on vacation, and how they feel,” said senior partner Jim Brennan, who works with Dupreelle on the investor side of BCG. “The influence of social media drives a lot of their behavior.” Dupreelle also noted that compared with the older generations, Millennials were more likely to have grown up in more affluent households and been exposed to luxury brands at an early age, so they have a high level of luxury brand recognition and they want luxury brands’ earned status to rub off on them.  “This generation is more complex to connect with, especially with the need to manage the sense of exclusivity and scarcity,” observed Dupreelle. “It’s going to require a new way of thinking to connect with these consumers.” Luxury brands must tread carefully as they try to align with the status and prestige drives of Millennials without making them feel too materialistic, acquisitive and inauthentic, never a good look for any consumer but most especially the socially-conscious and culturally-sensitive Millennials. Since the dawn of time, people have used symbols as a sign of one’s rank or position within the social hierarchy, the definition of social status. With the industrial age, such status symbols became more accessible to the masses, requiring artisans, designers and brands catering to a higher-class clientele to continually elevate the luxury status of their goods to distance and differentiate their offerings. So the status of luxury brands – an intersection of brand reputation and the perceived social circles in which its customers move – is inextricably linked to a consumer’s desire to purchase a brand to hitch their social status to the luxury brand’s wagon.  “Status is one of the key central motivations that explains why people buy luxury,” shares David Dubois, Ph.D., who is associate professor in marketing at INSEAD and has made the study of consumers’ status motivation a focus in his extensive research.  “Obviously, nobody cares to admit they want to build their status by purchasing luxury goods, so they emphasize other things like craftsmanship, quality, etc., but status building is very important because people want respect in the eyes of others.” Complicating the desire for luxury brands to enhance one’s social status are two conflicting motivations that Dubois has unraveled in his research:   These competing motivations play out differently depending upon the circumstance. For example, one might purchase a Louis Vuitton handbag because the brand is popular with one’s peers, i.e. assimilation, but choose a style that nobody else has, i.e. differentiation.  And depending upon the cultural context, one motivation may be more prominent than the other. “Looking through a cultural lens, we find the need for uniqueness is strong in places like the U.S. and Western Europe, whereas the need for assimilation is stronger in China,” he observes, noting why some brands may falter exporting their brand of luxury into foreign markets.  Luxury brands’ differentiation value can be diminished if they grow too big or their logos are displayed too prominently. “Luxury is about low volume and high margins and if that slips, the brand goes down in status by diluting its differentiating uniqueness,” he observes.  “The biggest risk to a luxury brand is to be spread too much.” And while the assimilation motive might seem to pertain primarily to those seeking to climb the social ladder, even those at the top of the ladder want to fit into their tribe. Status signaling is a primary driver for luxury purchases to everyone up and down the social hierarchy. An individual’s social status is critical to one’s personal identity and the brands they consume are a contributing factor in their identity, a variation on Descartes’ cogito, ego sum principle: “I consume, therefore I am.”  “Beyond being a signal of status, luxury brands are increasingly signals of identity. Are you a ‘Patagonia’ or a ‘Ralph Lauren’ person? And beyond being symbols of identity, they can become enablers of identity,” Dubois said.  That creates an opportunity for luxury brands to not just offer products but experiences to help craft one’s identity. He points to Panerai Xperiences Program, where for the price of a limited-edition Experiences watch, purchasers can participate in extreme sports, military excursions and other adventures. For example, Panerai collaborates with the U.S. Navy SEALs to put participants through rigorous training and immersive experiences in Florida.  Surely, being able to afford a Panerai watch says something about one’s social status, but being able to do what a Navy SEAL does takes status to a whole other level, not to mention the band-of-brothers’ camaraderie shared within the exclusive group.  Thus Panerai Xperiences meets and exceeds both the customers’ differentiation and assimilation motivations. Despite consumers wanting the status that owning luxury brands confers, Dubois warns of a “dark side” to luxury consumption that could deter consumers. Luxury consumers at all income levels, even high-income consumers, may feel conflicted by being perceived as inauthentic and having undue privilege.  They can worry about being viewed as antisocial, selfish, wasteful and over-materialistic. Even thinking about buying a luxury product compared with a non-luxury equivalent can create a feeling of “hubristic pride.”  Thus, consumers must weigh the rewards of luxury purchasing against the psychological risks.  “Such tensions are a reminder that the vehicles of status-pursuit constantly change in step with evolving norms and values that prevail in specific groups or at specific points in time, and of consumers’ need to navigate the complicated maze of status meanings associated with a wide array of luxury and non-luxury behaviors,” he wrote in a paper entitled “The psychology of luxury consumption.” Some are born with the silver spoon of status in their mouths, but the vast majority of people who achieve financial success that makes luxury purchases possible start by aspiring to reach affluent status.  And virtually every penny luxury brands spend on marketing and advertising – a heavy investment indeed – is meant to build aspiration and desire for the brand and its products. Aspiration and luxury go inextricably together.  Yet the luxury industry uses the term “aspiration” in a disparaging way. So-called “aspirational consumers” are considered second-class customers, and “aspirational brands” are relegated to a lower tier and not in the same class as true-luxury brands.  This ignores the obvious: aspiration for status is essential to the luxury business model.   “Consumers’ enduring drive for luxury largely derives from the need for status, that is ‘respect, admiration and voluntary deference afforded by others,’” writes Dubois. “This need drives the way consumers select, use and decode signals associated with high status in the marketplace. Status ‘leaks’ from these valued signals to their depositaries,” i.e. the customers.  The BCG survey reveals a powerful drive among Millennials to display their wealth and accomplishments and to project the right image. By ignoring consumers’ status motivation in luxury purchasing or worse, looking down upon them for having it, luxury brands may be missing opportunities to connect with this generation, which Bain predicts will account for between 50% to 55% of global luxury sales by 2030.  But it’s going to take some finesse because of the conflicting differentiation and assimilation motives for consumers when purchasing luxury brands and the positive and potentially negative feelings such purchases may inspire.  “Given the large heterogeneity in what consumers consider as a luxury, tensions may emerge among different forms of luxury consumption as status symbols become increasingly complex and acquire conflicting meanings in the marketplace,” Dubois concludes.",

    "text": "\nEditor‚Äôs Note: Dorothy Brown is a professor of law at Emory University. She has published numerous articles about the race and class implications of federal tax policy.\n Dorothy Brown: We live with the myth that we have a progressive tax system In fact, she says, people like Mitt Romney, Barack Obama pay at lower rates than secretaries She says the low flat rate on dividends and capital gains protects the wealthy Brown: Getting rid of the progressive tax brackets is a step toward a fairer system \n            Last week we learned that Barack and Michelle Obama‚Äôs effective tax rate for 2011 was 20.5%.  They had adjusted gross income of $789,674.  We also learned that their tax rate was slightly lower than President Obama‚Äôs secretary, who had about $95,000 of income.  \n     \n            Ours is supposed to be a progressive rate system, which means as income gets higher, so do tax rates. In a true progressive rate system, Obama would never pay a lower tax rate than his secretary.\n     \n            We also know that Mitt and Ann Romney have a projected effective tax rate of 15% for 2011. They have requested an extension so we don‚Äôt have their actual returns. Their household income was just shy of $21 million. In a true progressive tax system, the Romneys would never pay a lower tax rate than the Obamas.  \n     \n            We do not have a progressive tax system. The notion of a progressive tax system is the lie that has been perpetuated far too long.\n     \n            First, not all income is taxed the same. While our income tax has always had progressive rates, for most of the 20th century a lower rate applied to certain nonwage income. That rate differential was increased dramatically as a result of the Bush tax cuts.  \n     \n            Most of the Romneys‚Äô income comes from stock ownership. Stock dividends and capital gains are generally not subject to our progressive rate system. Income from stock is taxed at a flat 15% rate. \n     \n            Fewer than 1 in 5 Americans owns stock in a way that qualifies for the flat rate.  Of that minority, very few benefit the way the Romneys do.  \n     \n            An analysis of IRS statistics show that for households up to $200,000, no more than about 5% of their income is eligible for the flat 15% rate. Those households combined represent well more than 90% of American households.  \n     \n            The Simpson-Bowles commission included a proposal that all income should be taxed the same.  While some would say that is a radical step, it is precisely what we did in 1986.\n     \n            Second, not all deductions are treated the same. Two-thirds of all taxpayers do not itemize their deductions but take the standard deduction. So, as a result, most Americans do not even benefit from the myriad of special interest group deductions found in our tax code.  \n     \n            In addition, under a progressive tax system, the value of a deduction depends upon what rate your last dollar is taxed. That is referred to as your marginal tax rate.   \n     \n            The more income you have, the higher your marginal tax rate and the greater the value of the deduction. \n     \n            For example, if your marginal tax rate is 35%, then for every dollar you spend, you save 35 cents.  If your marginal tax rate is 15%, then for every dollar you spend, you save only 15 cents. That explains why those in higher income brackets seek out tax deductions as a way to save money on their taxes.\n     \n            Third, all of this is supposed to be a secret. \n     \n            The only reason we have the information is because taxpayers voluntarily disclosed it ‚Äì either because they are presidential candidates or concerned citizens such as investor Warren Buffett.  The IRS statistics do a great job of masking this information because the real problem lies within the top 1% of taxpayers, and the data are not presented in a way that isolates that group.  \n     \n            Congress decides to enact a tax law, and the president signs the bill. While presidents voluntarily release their tax returns, members of Congress do not. The first step toward real tax reform would be for every member of Congress to release his or her tax return.  We can see which tax provisions benefit them, and we can compare their effective tax rates with our own.\n     \n            Achieving meaningful tax reform will require very few steps.\n     \n            First, tax all forms of income at the same rate. Second, repeal the progressive tax system and enact a flat tax. If a flat tax is good enough for Mitt and Ann Romney, it should be good enough for the rest of us.  \n     \n            Most flat tax proponents, however, want a flat tax, but they want to exempt income from stock completely.  That would mean Mitt and Ann Romney‚Äôs already low 15% effective tax rate would be cut even further.  That would be wrong-headed tax reform.\n     \n            Finally, most deductions should be eliminated. Most taxpayers do not itemize, so this change would only affect about one-third of taxpayers ‚Äì and their accountants and tax lawyers.  \n     \n            Whenever Congress enacts a deduction, it creates winners and losers.  That must stop. To be sure, every special interest group will oppose even the hint of this suggestion.

    "onlytext": "We live with the myth that we have a progressive tax system In fact, she says, people like Mitt Romney, Barack Obama pay at lower rates than secretaries She says the low flat rate on dividends and capital gains protects the wealthy\n\nLast week we learned that Barack and Michelle Obama‚Äôs effective tax rate for 2011 was 20.5%.  They had adjusted gross income of $789,674.  We also learned that their tax rate was slightly lower than President Obama‚Äôs secretary, who had about $95,000 of income.\n\nOurs is supposed to be a progressive rate system, which means as income gets higher, so do tax rates. In a true progressive rate system, Obama would never pay a lower tax rate than his secretary.\n\nWe also know that Mitt and Ann Romney have a projected effective tax rate of 15% for 2011. They have requested an extension so we don‚Äôt have their actual returns. Their household income was just shy of $21 million. In a true progressive tax system, the Romneys would never pay a lower tax rate than the Obamas.\n\nWe do not have a progressive tax system. The notion of a progressive tax system is the lie that has been perpetuated far too long.\n\nFirst, not all income is taxed the same. While our income tax has always had progressive rates, for most of the 20th century a lower rate applied to certain nonwage income. That rate differential was increased dramatically as a result of the Bush tax cuts.\n\nMost of the Romneys‚Äô income comes from stock ownership. Stock dividends and capital gains are generally not subject to our progressive rate system. Income from stock is taxed at a flat 15% rate.\n\nFewer than 1 in 5 Americans owns stock in a way that qualifies for the flat rate.  Of that minority, very few benefit the way the Romneys do.\n\nAn analysis of IRS statistics show that for households up to $200,000, no more than about 5% of their income is eligible for the flat 15% rate. Those households combined represent well more than 90% of American households.\n\nThe Simpson-Bowles commission included a proposal that all income should be taxed the same.  While some would say that is a radical step, it is precisely what we did in 1986.\n\nSecond, not all deductions are treated the same. Two-thirds of all taxpayers do not itemize their deductions but take the standard deduction. So, as a result, most Americans do not even benefit from the myriad of special interest group deductions found in our tax code.\n\nIn addition, under a progressive tax system, the value of a deduction depends upon what rate your last dollar is taxed. That is referred to as your marginal tax rate.\n\nThe more income you have, the higher your marginal tax rate and the greater the value of the deduction.\n\nFor example, if your marginal tax rate is 35%, then for every dollar you spend, you save 35 cents.  If your marginal tax rate is 15%, then for every dollar you spend, you save only 15 cents. That explains why those in higher income brackets seek out tax deductions as a way to save money on their taxes.\n\nThird, all of this is supposed to be a secret.\n\nThe only reason we have the information is because taxpayers voluntarily disclosed it ‚Äì either because they are presidential candidates or concerned citizens such as investor Warren Buffett.

    "title": "How to Soak the Rich",
    "domain": "theatlantic.com",
    "text": "Democratic 2020 candidates are already discussing how to make a more progressive tax code. What’s the best way? With the 2020 primary already under way and the House back in Democratic hands, the left has proposed a number of spending programs aimed at ending poverty and boosting the middle class: a jobs guarantee, a Green New Deal, a massive expansion of the earned-income tax credit, Medicare for All, a universal child allowance, and on and on. Democrats do not want to talk about how to pay for each and every penny of such proposals. But it is clear they intend to raise more money from the rich, and are now pushing policies that would do just that. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to raise the top marginal income-tax rate to 70 percent; for every dollar a person earns over $10 million, Ocasio-Cortez suggests, he should be left with 30 cents. Senator Bernie Sanders, a likely 2020 candidate, wants to expand the estate tax. And Senator Elizabeth Warren, a definite 2020 candidate, has proposed an annual tax on wealth, taking 2 percent of fortunes over $50 million and an additional 1 percent of fortunes over $1 billion. The shared idea here is to make the tax code far more progressive as the left makes the government far more redistributive. Such tax policies tend to please liberals concerned that the party has failed to curtail inequality and to blunt its political effects, and terrify conservatives who argue that such policies are confiscatory and would hurt long-term growth. But what about the tax nerds? What do they make of these ideas on how to soak the rich? Shadi Hamid: Ocasio-Cortez understands politics better than her critics The green-eyeshade folks aren’t fond of short, easy answers. But, to start, experts said that there was nothing unusual or even that radical about what Ocasio-Cortez has in mind. Higher rates were common throughout the 20th century, with the top marginal rate averaging 78 percent from 1930 to 1980 and climbing up to 90 percent in the late 1950s and early ’60s. “Ocasio-Cortez has done a great public service in just saying, ‘You know, we could have higher rates,’” said Mark Mazur, an economist at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, D.C. “In the past, we have had them, and they worked. And you don’t have to go all the way to 70 percent. But right now we’re stuck with this question of whether the top rate should be 39.6 percent or 37 percent—that’s a pretty narrow range. What she’s saying is you can imagine taking them up a lot higher.” That said, if the goal is to raise more money for redistributive policies and to ensure that millionaires pay their fair share, Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal isn’t particularly efficient. It might not even raise that much money, instead discouraging employers from paying workers more than $10 million or workers from trying to earn more than that threshold. Imagine you were a lawyer who often earned in the high millions a year; if you hit the $9 million mark in the fall, you might work somewhat less, knowing that much of what you made over $10 million would get taxed away. The tax rate would, in effect, reduce inequality in pretax incomes, as well as in posttax incomes. (It would also encourage the very rich to hide income above $10 million.) A better way to extract money from top earners would be to get rid of the loopholes, deductions, and exemptions they use to shelter income from taxation in the first place, economists said. “Broadening the tax base is generally more efficient than changing rates,” said Kyle Pomerleau of the Tax Foundation, a think tank in Washington, D.C. “That would include getting at what I would call the Big Three, which is the charitable deduction, the home-mortgage-interest deduction, and the state- and local-tax deduction.” Derek Thompson: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has the better tax argument The charitable deduction allows very high earners to spend on nonprofit causes that they find interesting and valuable, as opposed to turning that money over to Uncle Sam for what the broad public wants and needs. (As the Trump Foundation so extravagantly shows, such charitable largesse is often anything but.) The home-mortgage-interest deduction prompts the rich to buy even fancier houses than they could otherwise afford. And the state and local deduction reduces the tax bills of rich families who happen to live in high-tax states. Together, the Big Three cost the government something like $100 billion a year. Eliminating these deductions would not just raise more money, but also reduce distortions in the economy, experts think: The government would no longer nudge billionaires to spend extravagantly on big houses or concert halls or hospital naming rights, or subsidize the cost of living in New York or California. There’s a whole slew of other deductions and exclusions, such as provisions for the owners of corporate jets, that the government would do well to erase, too. There’s also a strong case for raising the country’s preferential, low tax rates on dividends and capital gains and getting rid of the carried-interest loophole—provisions that cost the government about $130 billion a year. Right now investors pay a top rate of 23.8 percent on long-term-investment earnings, versus 37 percent on ordinary income. The argument for keeping that rate low is that it encourages investment. But the carried-interest loophole is a straightforward tax dodge for hedge-fund managers. Investment income is income and should be taxed more like regular income, many tax experts think. As for Warren’s wealth tax, that proposal comes from two of the world’s preeminent scholars on inequality, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley. (The former is in part responsible for much of the data showing the rise in income inequality in the United States; the latter literally wrote the book on the role of tax evasion in widening inequality.) Their wealth tax would raise an estimated 1 percent of GDP a year, or about $200 billion. Read: How America’s vision of progressive tax reform died “The main argument is that an annual progressive wealth tax is the most direct way to limit the increase in wealth concentration,” Zucman told me. “The wealth share of the top 0.1 percent has increased from 7 percent in 1980 to about 20 percent today. The wealth tax is the most powerful tool to catalyze wealth concentration—depending on the rate, to limit its increase or to make it shrink.” He added that a wealth tax would also “enable the government to tax people who have a lot of wealth, not a lot of income,” such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon. His 2017 salary: $81,840. His net worth: $135 billion or so, depending on the state of the stock market. With a wealth tax, very high-net-worth individuals would tally up the value of their estates—property, racehorses, art, business holdings, licensing fees, you name it—and pay a small share of that sum to the government annually; the government could use land, investment, and asset registers, as well as audits, to ensure compliance. “It’s very important that there are no exemptions,” so that the rich do not just shift assets around into classes that are not counted, Zucman told me. Still, tax experts said the wealth tax would be difficult for the government to administer. “If we all had all of our wealth in publicly traded securities, it would be easy, but we don’t, and that’s what makes it hard,” Mazur said. “People hold a lot of wealth in closely held businesses, like a car dealership or a ranching operation, or in partnerships that trade assets, like hedge funds. Those things are hard to value. What a wealth tax does is have the government say, ‘Rich people, raise your hands and tell us what your wealth is!’ They’re probably not going to give you a good answer.” There might be other ways to get at the same pool of people and the same pool of wealth without asking so much of the Internal Revenue Service. Pomerleau said the government might focus on taxing events where wealth changes hands, rather than assessing and taxing 75,000 people’s net worth each year. “It is easier to tax a transaction or transfer than an asset—there’s a market, and transactions are tracked,” he said. One option would be to jack up the estate tax, as Sanders wants to do, in essence creating a big, one-off wealth tax on the rich people who happen to die in a given year. Financial-transaction taxes would also hit the same pocket of very wealthy Americans. The minutiae of Warren’s, Sanders’s, and Ocasio-Cortez’s proposals aside, the tax code is riddled with provisions that let the richest Americans accumulate vast pools of wealth, worsening inequality and even fraying the country’s very democracy. There are better ways and worse ways to extract money from the rich, but Democrats have a strong argument that one way or another, the government ought to soak the rich.

Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Budget Committee, on Capitol Hill in February. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is turning the committee best known for writing budgets that never become law into a vetting ground for progressive policy. Sanders views his new jurisdiction as a broad mandate that \"essentially in one way or another, touches the lives of every American.\" In keeping with that vision, Sanders will introduce a pair of bills on Thursday to restore the corporate tax rate to 35% and add a new progressive tax on the estates of the wealthiest Americans. \"What we want to do is use the committee to focus on the crises facing the working class of this country, the middle class of this country, talk about issues like income and wealth inequality, talk about the mass amounts of tax avoidance and tax breaks that the very wealthiest people in this country, talk about student debt, talk about how much it will cost us if we do not address the existential threat of climate change,\" Sanders said in an interview with NPR. \"In other words, look at the major issues facing our country and focus a spotlight on them.\" Sanders is introducing the bills, both of which face long odds in the closely divided Senate, as part of a broader push to walk back tax cuts that were enacted under former President Donald Trump and to go further in redistributing the tax burden to corporations and the wealthy. The first bill would restore the corporate tax rate to 35%, undoing a cornerstone of Trump's 2017 tax overhaul. Republicans cut the corporate rate to 21% in that bill, a move that Joint Committee on Taxation valued at $1.3 trillion over 10 years. The bill would also end rules that allow companies to further reduce their tax bill by shifting operations offshore. A second bill would add a new way to tax the wealthiest estates in the country. Sanders says the bill is aimed at the fortunes of the top 0.5%. It would exempt the first $3.5 million of an individual's estate from the estate tax, $7 million for married couples. Those with estates between $3.5 million and $10 million would be taxed at 45%, and the rate would jump to 50% between $10 million and $50 million, 55% for estates over $50 million and 65% for estates valued at over $1 billion. The focus on taxes comes weeks after President Biden signed $1.9 trillion in new coronavirus relief spending into law. That bill, which Sanders helped move through the Senate, included billions for unemployment insurance, housing vouchers, rent assistance, stimulus checks and direct aid to millions of people. Democrats, who control 50 votes in the Senate, passed the legislation without any GOP votes using a budget tool called reconciliation. That process requires just 51 votes to pass and Democrats can muster those votes if they have unanimous agreement and call in Vice President Harris to break the tie. Congress gets one shot at reconciliation each time they pass a budget — which they can only do once every fiscal year which runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30 each year. They have two chances this year because Trump did not pass a budget in fiscal year 2020, and Democrats took the opportunity to pass one of their own when they took over in January. Sanders now oversees reconciliation as Budget Committee chair, and he is already contemplating what the second bill should include. \"The second reconciliation bill will deal with long-term structural problems that we've had in this country long before the pandemic,\" Sanders said. That includes spending on traditional infrastructure programs, like roads, bridges, water systems and wastewater. But Sanders says it should also include climate change and social programs like affordable housing. \"We need to build millions of units of low income and affordable housing,\" he said. \"We must address the crisis of climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel. And when we do those things, deal with infrastructure, deal with climate, we can in fact create many, many millions of good paying jobs.\" Those proposals are likely to reignite a familiar battle between centrist Democrats and the demands of the party's progressive base that Sanders represents. That fight was on display in the last reconciliation fight when Democrats failed to pass a $15 federal minimum wage. Just 42 Democrats voted for Sanders' plan to increase wages, and his long-term plans for wealth redistribution and cutting fossil fuels are certain to meet similar objections. When it comes to the minimum wage, Sanders says part of the challenge will be demonstrating that the Democratic Party is with him on the policy. \"There is not unanimity within the Democratic Caucus,\" he said. \"And my job is to rally the American people and to create a strategy.\" Some of that will involves creating pressure and spreading a message from the budget committee. When it comes to taxes, part of that message is that tax increases help pay for all of the spending Democrats have passed or plan to approve in the future. \"I do worry about the deficit that we have and the national debt that we have,\" Sanders said. \"And I worry that we have a tax system, which is in many ways extremely rigged. So you have large, profitable corporations over the years pay zero in federal income tax. \" Some, like Sanders, have suggested increasing taxes to help pay for that spending. Reshaping the tax code is part of his broader effort to redistribute wealth in the country. \"What we need to do, in the midst of massive income and wealth inequality, when the rich are becoming much richer, while the middle class struggles, we need a tax system, which says to the wealthy and large corporations that they're finally going to have to start paying their fair share of taxes,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, we need massive tax reform in this country, so that we end the tax loopholes and the giveaways that the wealthy and large corporations.\" As for when and how that gets done, Sanders says he isn't making any specific demands. But passing tax hikes outside of reconciliation creates a familiar problem for Democrats — they simply do not have enough votes to do something like that in the Senate where most legislation requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. That's why Sanders says it's time for the filibuster to end. \"As the Republican Party moves further and further to the right, their main task is obstructionism,\" Sanders said. \"And what we have got to say is that majority rules, when the American people want something when the House wants something, we cannot have just a minority of senators preventing us from moving so yes, I do support at this point, repealing the filibuster.\" But that's another issue where Democrats aren't unanimous — and they would need to be if they're going to make a change. Sanders himself used to be cautious about the ending filibuster. Doing away with the 60-vote requirement to pass legislation would give Republicans the chance to reverse policies and pass their own priorities if they controlled the Senate again. \"I think, in the best of all possible worlds, I would like to see a Senate where you can debate for long periods of time, etc., etc.,\" he said. \"But we're not in the best of all possible worlds.\" Asked if this new chairmanship and the influence it affords means he is done running for president, Sanders laughed. \"Well,\" he said. \"I am very content being the chairman of the budget committee and Vermont senator right now.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "onlytext": "Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is turning the committee best known for writing budgets that never become law into a vetting ground for progressive policy. Sanders views his new jurisdiction as a broad mandate that \"essentially in one way or another, touches the lives of every American.\" In keeping with that vision, Sanders will introduce a pair of bills on Thursday to restore the corporate tax rate to 35% and add a new progressive tax on the estates of the wealthiest Americans.\n\n\"What we want to do is use the committee to focus on the crises facing the working class of this country, the middle class of this country, talk about issues like income and wealth inequality, talk about the mass amounts of tax avoidance and tax breaks that the very wealthiest people in this country, talk about student debt, talk about how much it will cost us if we do not address the existential threat of climate change,\" Sanders said in an interview with NPR. \"In other words, look at the major issues facing our country and focus a spotlight on them.\"\n\nSanders is introducing the bills, both of which face long odds in the closely divided Senate, as part of a broader push to walk back tax cuts that were enacted under former President Donald Trump and to go further in redistributing the tax burden to corporations and the wealthy.\n\nThe first bill would restore the corporate tax rate to 35%, undoing a cornerstone of Trump's 2017 tax overhaul. Republicans cut the corporate rate to 21% in that bill, a move that Joint Committee on Taxation valued at $1.3 trillion over 10 years. The bill would also end rules that allow companies to further reduce their tax bill by shifting operations offshore.\n\nA second bill would add a new way to tax the wealthiest estates in the country. Sanders says the bill is aimed at the fortunes of the top 0.5%. It would exempt the first $3.5 million of an individual's estate from the estate tax, $7 million for married couples. Those with estates between $3.5 million and $10 million would be taxed at 45%, and the rate would jump to 50% between $10 million and $50 million, 55% for estates over $50 million and 65% for estates valued at over $1 billion.\n\nThe focus on taxes comes weeks after President Biden signed $1.9 trillion in new coronavirus relief spending into law. That bill, which Sanders helped move through the Senate, included billions for unemployment insurance, housing vouchers, rent assistance, stimulus checks and direct aid to millions of people. Democrats, who control 50 votes in the Senate, passed the legislation without any GOP votes using a budget tool called reconciliation.\n\nThat process requires just 51 votes to pass and Democrats can muster those votes if they have unanimous agreement and call in Vice President Harris to break the tie. Congress gets one shot at reconciliation each time they pass a budget — which they can only do once every fiscal year which runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30 each year. They have two chances this year because Trump did not pass a budget in fiscal year 2020, and Democrats took the opportunity to pass one of their own when they took over in January.\n\nSanders now oversees reconciliation as Budget Committee chair, and he is already contemplating what the second bill should include. \"The second reconciliation bill will deal with long-term structural problems that we've had in this country long before the pandemic,\" Sanders said. That includes spending on traditional infrastructure programs, like roads, bridges, water systems and wastewater. But Sanders says it should also include climate change and social programs like affordable housing.\n\n\"We need to build millions of units of low income and affordable housing,\" he said. \"We must address the crisis of climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel. And when we do those things, deal with infrastructure, deal with climate, we can in fact create many, many millions of good paying jobs.\"\n\nThose proposals are likely to reignite a familiar battle between centrist Democrats and the demands of the party's progressive base that Sanders represents. That fight was on display in the last reconciliation fight when Democrats failed to pass a $15 federal minimum wage. Just 42 Democrats voted for Sanders' plan to increase wages, and his long-term plans for wealth redistribution and cutting fossil fuels are certain to meet similar objections.\n\nWhen it comes to the minimum wage, Sanders says part of the challenge will be demonstrating that the Democratic Party is with him on the policy. \"There is not unanimity within the Democratic Caucus,\" he said. \"And my job is to rally the American people and to create a strategy.\"\n\nSome of that will involves creating pressure and spreading a message from the budget committee.

That‚Äôs only about 1% of the 80 million hourly workers nationwide.\n     \n            Far more people, however, make under $15 an hour ‚Äì about 14 million, Zipperer said.\n     \n            ‚ÄúThe economy has basically moved on‚Äù from wages that low, he added.

Nearly two dozen states, cities and local municipalities will see some form of a minimum wage hike go into effect July 1, according to a report by the worker advocacy group National Employment Law Project. Jan. 1, 2025 marked a popular day for pay increases across the U.S., as 21 states and 48 cities raised their minimum wage rates. In total, 88 jurisdictions across 23 states were set to see minimum wage hikes by the end of 2025, the report said.

The changes often result in marginal increases in hourly rates that are less than a dollar. Several pertain only to workers in a specific sector or to businesses of a certain size. New wages effective July 1 include: Elsewhere in the country, Maryland's Montgomery County will raise pay to $15.50, $16 or $17.65 per hour, depending on the amount of employees, coming out to about a 50 cent raise.

They're among the many thousands of laws changing as a new year begins. Those wage increases will impact an estimated 9.2 million workers and raise pay by a total of $5.7 billion, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank that publishes economic research and examined the expected 2025 wage increases.  An additional 48 cities and counties will raise their minimum wages above their state wage floors starting Tuesday. California, which is increasing the minimum wage from $16 to $16.50, is one of the 14 states adjusting the minimum to increase for inflation. The average full-time minimum-wage worker in these states will make around $420 more annually, according to EPI. Five states are bumping up the statewide minimum wage through previously adopted legislation, and two states — Nebraska and Montana — are making changes after voters passed ballot measures. With these continued increases, EPI found that 19 states and Washington, D.C., will have at least a $15 minimum wage by 2027.  Meanwhile the federal minimum wage of $7.25  has not increased in 15 years and the spending power of one dollar is not what it used to be — putting workers in a tough spot as prices for groceries and housing have risen over time.  Research shows that a full-time minimum wage worker earning $7.25 an hour makes just $20 more than the poverty guidelines for a single-person household.

    "onlytext": "Minimum-wage workers in 21 states will see a bigger paycheck come the new year. They're among the many thousands of laws changing as a new year begins. Those wage increases will impact an estimated 9.2 million workers and raise pay by a total of $5.7 billion, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank that publishes economic research and examined the expected 2025 wage increases.  An additional 48 cities and counties will raise their minimum wages above their state wage floors starting Tuesday. California, which is increasing the minimum wage from $16 to $16.50, is one of the 14 states adjusting the minimum to increase for inflation. The average full-time minimum-wage worker in these states will make around $420 more annually, according to EPI. Five states are bumping up the statewide minimum wage through previously adopted legislation, and two states — Nebraska and Montana — are making changes after voters passed ballot measures. With these continued increases, EPI found that 19 states and Washington, D.C., will have at least a $15 minimum wage by 2027.  Meanwhile the federal minimum wage of $7.25  has not increased in 15 years and the spending power of one dollar is not what it used to be — putting workers in a tough spot as prices for groceries and housing have risen over time.  Research shows that a full-time minimum wage worker earning $7.25 an hour makes just $20 more than the poverty guidelines for a single-person household. Add kids or needing to care for other family members, and that worker falls below poverty levels.

    "text": "Minimum wage hikes traditionally have been aimed at helping low-paid workers afford the basics, such as food, medicine and housing. But a growing number of states and localities are raising their pay floors to $15 an hour or above, providing workers a somewhat larger financial cushion so they can not only pay for essentials with less of a struggle but also make some discretionary purchases.  Twenty-one states and 48 cities and counties are set to raise their minimum wages on Jan. 1, according to a report provided exclusively to USA TODAY by the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. Other states and a few more cities and counties will raise their minimum wages later in 2025. While the pay floor bumps mark an annual ritual, the report highlights an acceleration in the size of minimum wage increases in recent years. On New Year’s Day, three states – Illinois, Delaware and Rhode Island – will reach a $15 pay base for the first time, joining seven states already there or above it. Two states, California and New Jersey, are set to push their pay floors further above $17 for some health care workers. Meanwhile, 47 localities will also reach or top $15 on Jan. 1, including more than two dozen in California, most of which will climb further above $17. Burien, Washington, already subject to the state’s $16.28 minimum pay, will vault to $21.16 for employers with 500 or more workers in King County, making it the nation’s highest pay floor. “Remember that a full-time worker earning $17 per hour is only earning $35,360 annually pretax,” Yannet Lathrop, NELP’s senior researcher and policy analyst, wrote in an email. “Those wage levels won’t make workers wealthy, but they will help with paying for the basics, for a few luxuries (hopefully).\" She added, “Those higher wages may also improve their mental and physical health, their ability to access credit, and may lead to better educational outcomes of their children.” In January, several states will take a step in a series of minimum wage hikes over several years. Among the three hitting $15 for the first time, Illinois and Rhode Island are at $14 and Delaware is at $13.25. Others are increasing their minimums, but stopping short of $15. Missouri’s base pay will jump to $13.75 from $12.30 and Nebraska’s to $13.50 from $12. Kaamilya Hobbs, 33, of Kansas City, Missouri, earns $13.44 an hour working 20 to 25 hours at a local Arby’s. Her boyfriend mostly cares for their three children, a newborn and two toddlers, but sometimes does food delivery for DoorDash. Their combined pay is barely enough to pay basic expenses. Sometimes, the couple has to delay paying rent or a cellphone bill for 30 days. “It’s a little bit tricky,” Hobbs said.  “After rent and food and expenses for the kids, we don’t have too much left over to be able to do anything day to day.” Missouri’s minimum wage increase to $13.75 “would help a little,” she said. The family might have to juggle bill payments less often. Plus, she said, “I’d be able to visit my mom more often.” Now, she rarely visits her mother, who lives about 25 miles away, because of the gasoline cost. But Hobbs said she’s hoping for additional minimum wage hikes. “The cost of living is still going to be going up,” she said. “We can’t live on $13.75.” Many states – including Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Ohio and Virginia – are imposing smaller base pay rises linked to annual increases in the cost of living based on the consumer price index. Later in 2025, a handful of states and a couple dozen localities will also boost their minimum wages. The upshot: A total of 23 states and 65 cities and counties – a record 88 jurisdictions – will lift their pay floors sometime next year. The increases will directly affect 3 million workers earning minimum wage and indirectly nudge up pay for 6.2 million higher-paid employees because of ripple effects on company pay structures, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. What stands out, though, is the growing contingent of states at $15 an hour or higher. New York, California, Massachusetts, Washington, Maryland, New Jersey and Connecticut are already there. And besides the three joining that faction on New Year’s Day, Oregon will get there in July because of a cost-of-living rise. Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Missouri and Nebraska will hit the $15 benchmark by 2026 or 2027. That makes 16 states with nearly half the U.S. workforce in states with pay floors of $15 or higher within the next three years, according to the National Employment Law Project and the Economic Policy Institute. “Fifteen dollars is still the target rate,” Lathrop said. “It’s now the competitive rate.” Minimum wage increases in the past few years have helped Americans keep pace with annual inflation that reached a 40-year high of 9.1% in mid-2022 before gradually falling to 2.6% recently. As a result of the laws, “Workers and their families don’t have to choose which bills to pay,” Lathrop said. Yet none of the planned wage floors would meet the threshold of a “living wage” that would allow workers to afford basics such as food, child care, health care, housing, transportation, broadband, and other necessities, Lathrop said. In King County, Washington, for example, the minimum wage is poised to rise to $20.29 on Jan. 1. But the living wage for an adult with no children in the county is $30.08, according to the MIT Living Wage Calculator. Michael Saltsman, managing director of the Employment Policies Institute, which is backed by the restaurant industry, noted that at least some minimum wage workers aren't financially squeezed because they live in households with higher total incomes. The $15 threshold was deemed a pipe dream when Fight for $15, an alliance of fast-food and other low-paid workers, began demanding it in walkouts across the nation starting in 2012. On April 1, however, the minimum hourly wage for fast-food workers in California leaped from $4 to $20, pushing it well above the state's standard $16 pay threshold. Meanwhile, the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009, with Republicans in Congress repeatedly blocking efforts to raise it. About 30 states with more than 60% of the U.S. workforce have higher pay floors than the federal government’s. Lathrop, though, says the issue transcends politics. This year, Alaska and Missouri, both Republican-dominated states, became the latest to pass ballot initiatives raising the minimum wage to $15 over the next few years. Saltsman, for his part, noted that voters in California and Massachusetts, two predominantly Democratic states, this year rejected proposals to raise the minimum wage for specific groups of workers. “They’re associated with higher prices and loss of jobs,” he said of the pay increases. Restaurants, he said, have passed along their higher labor costs to consumers by raising food prices. And the wage hikes have forced many eateries to close or lay off workers, he said. Various studies have supported both sides of the debate. Analyses by the University of California, Berkeley, and the National Bureau of Economic Research found that pay increases didn’t cause job losses within low-wage industries but did lead to some reduced employment among teens and other low-skilled workers. In 2021, a Congressional Budget Office report concluded that boosting the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would raise incomes for millions of Americans and lift 900,000 people out of poverty but reduce employment by about 1.4 million workers within a few years. Economist Dante DeAntonio of Moody’s Analytics said the minimum pay increases haven’t had a noticeable effect on inflation, in part, because the share of workers at or below the pay floors is small. State minimum wage hikes each January have contributed to sharper inflation early in the year but haven’t moved the needle on overall price increases in the months that followed, said Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist of Oxford Economics.",

    "text": "Published Jun 28, 2025 at 07:18 AM EDT US News Reporter Hundreds of thousands of workers across the U.S. are set to get a pay bump starting July 1, as minimum wage increases take effect in more than a dozen states, cities, and counties. According to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), more than 800,000 workers in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C. alone will see their baseline pay go up next month. Another dozen local jurisdictions—mostly in California—will also implement increases. The pay hikes come as the federal minimum wage remains stuck at $7.25 per hour, unchanged since 2009. With the cost of living continuing to rise, many states and cities have raised their own minimums through legislation, ballot measures or inflation adjustments. In Alaska, the minimum wage will rise by $1.09 to $13.00 an hour, an increase approved by voters through a ballot measure. EPI calculates the boost will affect 19,400 workers—about 6.3 percent of Alaska's workforce—and add an average of $925 per year to their paychecks. Washington, D.C. will raise its minimum by 45 cents to $17.95 an hour due to an automatic inflation adjustment, impacting an estimated 62,200 workers, or 7.5 percent of the city's workforce. The average worker there will earn about $727 more per year. In Oregon, about 801,700 workers—roughly 9.4 percent of the state's workforce—will see their minimum wage climb 35 cents to $15.05 an hour, also tied to inflation. That's an average annual increase of $420 per worker. Beyond those statewide and D.C. changes, minimum wages will increase in 12 cities and counties next month. That includes 10 cities and counties in California, with increases ranging from 45 to 59 cents an hour. New hourly rates will range from about $17.46 in Alameda to nearly $20 in Emeryville—one of the highest local minimum wages in the country. Cities including Berkeley and San Francisco will see their wages climb to $19.18 an hour, while workers in Los Angeles and surrounding areas will earn just under $18. Outside California, Chicago, Illinois, will boost its minimum wage by 40 cents, bringing it to $16.60 an hour. And in Maryland, Montgomery County will increase its minimum wage by 50 cents to $17.65 an hour. The EPI estimates that about 58 percent of workers benefiting from the July 1 hikes are women, while Black and Hispanic workers will also disproportionately gain. \"These minimum wage increases will put more money in workers' pockets, helping many of them and their families make ends meet,\" EPI state economic analyst Sebastian Martinez Hickey said. \"The average increase in annual wages for a full-time, year-round worker resulting from these minimum wage hikes ranges from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska.\" Calls to raise the federal wage persist. This month, Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri and Democratic Senator Peter Welch of Vermont introduced a bipartisan bill to lift the federal minimum to $15 per hour—more than double the current rate. Starting July 1, employers will have to ensure they review the changes made in different cities to minimum wage rates and pay their employees accordingly. © 2025 Newsweek Digital LLC",

    "text": "Watch CBS News \nJune 10, 2025 / 6:03 AM EDT\n            / CBS News\n           Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley plans to introduce legislation Tuesday to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour — a position that aligns one of the most conservative Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill with some of the most liberal members of Congress. The legislation, called the \"Higher Wages for American Workers Act,\" would raise the federal standard starting in 2026 and would also call for an increase in subsequent years to match inflation, CBS News has exclusively learned. Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch has signed on as a co-sponsor.  \"For decades, working Americans have seen their wages flatline. One major culprit of this is the failure of the federal minimum wage to keep up with the economic reality facing hard-working Americans every day,\" Hawley said in a statement to CBS News. \"This bipartisan legislation would ensure that workers across America benefit from higher wages.\" \"We're in the midst of a severe affordability crisis, with families in red and blue states alike struggling to afford necessities like housing and groceries,\" Welch said in a statement to CBS News. \"A stagnant federal minimum wage only adds fuel to the fire. Every hard-working American deserves a living wage that helps put a roof over their head and food on the table — $7.25 an hour doesn't even come close.\"  The federal minimum wage currently sits at $7.25 per hour and has not risen since 2009, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The move by Hawley puts him at odds with conservative party orthodoxy, which has traditionally opposed a federal minimum wage increase on the grounds that it would be costly for businesses and ultimately, for consumers. But Hawley's pitch is reflective of the party's realignment in the Trump era, where the president's brand of populism has fueled a shift among working-class voters away from Democrats and toward Republicans.  Hawley has been pushing Republicans to embrace this shift. The minimum wage legislation is part of a broader, aspirational package of legislative proposals he dubbed the \"Pro-Worker Framework for the 119th Congress.\" This includes a proposal to help strengthen protections for union jobs, as well as for organizing and collective bargaining.  Earlier this year, he teamed up with Sen. Bernie Sanders to introduce legislation to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. And in the last Congress, he introduced legislation that would require companies with revenues of $1 billion or more to pay their employees at least $15 per hour. In recent weeks, Hawley has been urging his party against cuts to Medicaid benefits in the budget reconciliation bill.  In November, voters in Hawley's home state of Missouri approved a ballot measure to raise the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour, starting in 2026. But the Legislature repealed part of the law that would allow later increases to adjust for inflation.  Earlier this year, President Trump rescinded a Biden-era executive order that raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $17.75 per hour. At his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he does not support raising the federal minimum wage, arguing that it is a decision best left up to the states.  \n      © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "text": "ByJaime Catmull, Contributor. For decades, conventional wisdom said Americans didn’t want affordable housing in their own communities. The not-in-my-backyard, or NIMBY, mindset was thought to be an immovable obstacle—support in theory, opposition in practice. But new national survey data tells a very different story. According to a poll of 1,000 U.S. adults conducted by Talker Research and commissioned by Built, a construction-finance technology company, 83% of Americans say they support affordable housing being built in their own neighborhoods. That finding runs counter to years of political assumptions and suggests a shift that could have real implications for household finances, community development, and the long-running national housing crisis. Housing affordability has become one of the defining financial challenges of our time. According to the US Census Bureau, roughly 21 million American households spend more than 30% of their income on rent, and millions more are locked out of homeownership altogether. Even middle-class families are struggling to keep up with high mortgage rates, escalating insurance premiums, and persistent supply shortages. If you’re a renter or prospective homebuyer, the lack of available, affordable units drives up your costs. If you already own, housing scarcity still affects your neighborhood—through higher property taxes, longer commutes for essential workers, and diminished local services when teachers, nurses, or first responders can’t afford to live nearby. The survey’s finding of broad public support signals that policy and market forces may finally align. If more Americans are open to affordable housing in their own backyards, the political and zoning obstacles that have slowed construction for decades may start to give way. One of the most surprising takeaways from the survey is how bipartisan the support is. Housing has long been a polarizing issue, with debates over rent control, zoning, and subsidies often breaking down along party lines. Yet Built’s data shows consensus. Ninety-two percent of Democrats say they would support affordable housing in their neighborhoods. Eighty-three percent of Independents agree. And perhaps most striking, 74% of Republicans say yes as well. That rare agreement suggests that Americans across the spectrum increasingly view housing affordability not as an ideological issue, but as a practical one tied directly to family finances and community stability. If public support is this broad—and Congress is advancing proposals like the Community Investment & Prosperity Act, the ROAD to Housing Act, and the Housing Affordability Act—the natural question is: why aren’t more units being built? The answer is partly structural. Housing construction depends on a financing system that often lags behind demand. Developers struggle with lengthy approval processes, inconsistent zoning laws, and outdated infrastructure funding. Even when the political appetite exists, the financial machinery to actually deliver projects often doesn’t. That may be changing. Private capital, new federal incentives, and local initiatives are beginning to accelerate. Cities from Atlanta to Minneapolis have eased restrictions to allow more multi-family units. States like California have mandated accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, as a right. And bipartisan momentum in Washington signals that federal support may flow more consistently in the coming years. For everyday families, that could translate into more housing options, less upward pressure on rents, and eventually, more accessible pathways to homeownership. For years, opponents of affordable housing often couched their arguments in terms of preserving property values, avoiding congestion, or maintaining neighborhood character. But the survey suggests that calculus is shifting. With more Americans struggling to find affordable options, as noted in a McKinsey Institute for Economic Mobility Report, resistance has softened. Most people know someone who has been priced out of the market, whether it’s adult children, aging parents, or essential workers. The pandemic underscored how much neighborhoods rely on proximity to service workers. When nurses, grocery clerks, or teachers can’t afford to live nearby, the whole community feels the impact. Generational dynamics are also at play. Younger voters, who face steeper housing costs than their parents did, are more supportive of affordable development. Their growing political influence is reshaping local and national debates. At the same time, more homeowners are beginning to see affordable housing not as a threat but as a stabilizing force, ensuring that essential community members can stay and that local economies don’t collapse under the weight of scarcity. Perhaps the most counterintuitive detail from the survey is that affordable housing is more popular than apartments, townhomes, or even mobile homes. That suggests Americans don’t just tolerate the idea—they prefer it. For policymakers, that may be the green light needed to prioritize affordable projects over more conventional developments. For families, it means the future of neighborhood growth may look different than expected. If political and financial barriers continue to fall, more affordable units will enter the market. That could help stabilize rents and cool overheated home prices in some regions. With more projects gaining approval, expect to see affordable housing built closer to existing residential areas. The survey suggests neighbors may welcome it more than in years past. And with bipartisan support, proposals once dismissed as unrealistic now have a path forward. America’s housing shortage is vast, and no single policy or project will solve it overnight. But the new survey data should challenge outdated assumptions. Most Americans no longer fit the NIMBY stereotype. They see affordable housing as a financial necessity and a community benefit. That matters for investors weighing where to allocate capital, for policymakers drafting housing bills, and most importantly, for families deciding where—and how—they can afford to live. As Chase Gilbert, CEO of Built, put it: “Affordability challenges have gone mainstream. More people are realizing affordable housing isn’t about charity—it’s about keeping the American dream within reach.” For personal finance readers, the bottom line is clear: affordable housing may be coming to your neighborhood sooner than you think—and unlike in decades past, most of your neighbors may welcome it.",

Can California's repeal of 70-year-old housing regulations spur much-needed development? Ben Metcalf, managing director of the Turner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley, joined The Excerpt to discuss the housing crisis.

There may be some differences between the audio and the text. Podcasts: True crime, in-depth interviews and more USA TODAY podcasts right here Dana Taylor: Hello, I'm Dana Taylor, and this is a special episode of USA TODAY's The Excerpt. Lack of affordable housing is an urgent problem in cities and states across America, but perhaps nowhere is it felt more acutely than in California. That's where a 55-year-old regulation known as CEQA, the California Environmental Quality Act, has created a lengthy process, a review process that's been blamed for gumming up the developmental pipeline, but in June, in a move that angered environmentalists, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed two bills that effectively roll back portions of CEQA. What happens now, and will the impact finally pave the way for developers to create the housing so desperately needed? Ben Metcalf, Managing Director of the Turner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley joins us to talk about what this might mean for housing in California. Ben, thank you so much for joining me. Ben Metcalf: It's my pleasure. I'm very happy to be here. Dana Taylor: Set the stage for us here. There's been a partial rollback of CEQA, the signature law which has largely been blamed for holding up new housing projects. What were the issues CEQA was originally trying to address, and what parts did Newsom effectively repeal in June? Ben Metcalf: CEQA was one of a number of state-level sort of environmental protection laws that came into force in the early 1970s, at a time of real environmental activism and a time where there was a real concern that development had been running rampant, and buildings had been getting built in places that were dangerous potentially for the inhabitants or causing real harm to wildlife or habitat. The law itself is actually sort of ... on paper, seems very reasonable. It just asks developers of land to do a study, to basically look at their site before they build, and figure out what all of the environmental impacts are likely to be as a consequence of the specific structure that they plan to put there. The idea is that by documenting and disclosing these harms, there's a daylighting of the process that allows for local governments to decide if they want to ask for changes or for developers to make those changes. That process has evolved over the last half a century into a bit of a complex regulatory system that has been very much criticized by folks in the building industry, because while it both serves that very valuable disclosure process, it also takes a lot of time to go through a public process of vetting that reporting, and it provides both a hook where local governments have sometimes used it to functionally block development, even though that wasn't the purpose, and it is a way by which any citizen can litigate, they can file lawsuits saying that that environmental review wasn't properly done. So it has been blamed as providing a effective veto to any citizen who's able to file a lawsuit. Dana Taylor: After signing the two bills, Newsom called it \"the most consequential housing reform that we've seen in modern history in the state of California\". Let's talk about likely impacts. What are you hearing from developers, and how long will people have to wait to see new housing take shape? Ben Metcalf: Yeah, so let me clarify, first of all, that the rollback only applies to development that's happening for ... well, primarily for residential housing, so people building new homes, and only really in the context of infill locations. So these are locations that are part of the city that are adjacent to build sites that are themselves sites that were previously developed. So part of the logic here from an environmental standpoint is that although it's rolling back some environmental protections, it's actually making it easier to build in the places where we know the environmental impacts are going to be less, and in fact, I think it's sort of a little bit reflective of a growing awareness that in the 1970s a lot of our interest was on, for example, habitat protection. We were worried about impacts to specific animals, we're worried about pollution. I think today, our concern has evolved to be really about climate change, and when you think about development from a climate perspective, really the first and most important thing that you can do is reduce the vehicle miles traveled. The more the people are in their cars driving, the greater the carbon, the greater the climate impact. So if you want to actually have environmental benefit, you want to steer more development towards these infill locations that are going to be more likely to be in compact neighborhoods, closer to transit, closer to existing infrastructure. So there's a little bit of a bargain that's being done here where we're saying, \"Okay, we're willing to have more development.\" If we can help more development happen in these infill locations, we're willing to have a lower standard of concern for the environmental impacts that may happen on a site by site basis. Dana Taylor: Do we know how long it's going to take before some of the actual development begins for this housing? Ben Metcalf: So what we do know probably with the most certainty is that all cohort of projects that are now sort of in their, what's called pre-development stage, they haven't yet started construction, but they're trying to get the approvals they need to begin building. A whole cohort of projects in that stage are going to be able to move forward faster and sooner. So if a typical environmental impact review that you would otherwise have to do is going to take four or five or six months, sometimes it takes quite a bit more, then that amount of your timeline is going to fall out. So projects that were sort of already in flight are going to get pulled forward and be able to get in the ground sooner. So I think we have a pretty good certainty that there's going to be a timing benefit for all of these in-fill residential projects in California going forward. I think what's a little bit less certain is does this induce new projects to get into the ground to go into development that didn't previously pencil or didn't make financial sense. Dana Taylor: I'm going to circle back to this. As you said, one group that's very unhappy with Newsom's move is environmentalists. What are their biggest concerns today? Ben Metcalf: They are very worried that by not doing this process of creating an environmental review, that we just won't know what we don't know, that we won't know if development is going forward in a place that does have a sensitive habitat or will cause significant impacts to other environmental concerns, whether it's air quality, water quality, or animal habitat. Again, I think the opposition from the environmental groups has been less than might've been expected. I think it's actually quite a bit less than we would've seen five or 10 or 15 years ago. Again, I think it's partly because the environmental movement is increasingly moving away from a concern just on these site-based impacts and more towards this global concern around emissions, carbon, pollution, and I think generally there's a widespread understanding that residential development is going to happen in a place like California. People are going to keep having kids, there are going to be new jobs getting created, and so it's in the interest of environmentalists to be facilitative of housing happening in infill area. I think the devil's in the details, though, because while environmental groups generally agree they want to help facilitate infill housing, they're still going to be looking for more limitations, conditions. The bill already does require, for example, there has to be some environmental assessment that's done. The bill already did say this doesn't apply for areas that are in flood zones or other certain kinds of very specific fire hazard zones, for example. So I mean, there's a little bit of compromise that was made in this vision to, I think, defuse some of the opposition, but I think there's going to continue to be a negotiation review and possibly some future legislative amendments to this over the next year or two. Dana Taylor: How might Newsom's partial repeal kickstart the availability of affordable housing? Do the new laws address the need for more multi-family construction? Ben Metcalf: Well, the primary beneficiary of this will be multifamily housing. In these infill locations, multifamily does comprise a larger share of net new residential housing than single family. Both some single family and multifamily both can benefit, but in practice it'll be more multifamily, and what we do know about multifamily housing is that even when it's not formally subsidized or officially \"affordable\", it does just tend to get priced at more accessible price points and tends to be smaller units. So look, I think any sort of new supply is going to be helpful. California is way, way, way behind on its overall housing supply. Building permit numbers have been really down for the last 15 to 20 years. So any sort of new supply is going to be helpful, and I think this kind of supply, which tends to be multifamily, which has to be infill, is probably going to be the most helpful for addressing affordability crisis. Dana Taylor: California is not alone in its struggles to create more affordable housing. Are there lessons for the rest of the country to be learned from California here? Ben Metcalf: Historically, the focus on affordable housing has manifested itself as \"let's create new affordable housing programs\", like \"let's build new public housing or pay for vouchers or low income housing tax credits.\" I think what's interesting here is there's this awareness that part of the reason, maybe the primary reason that the affordability crisis has gotten so bad is a function simply of a lack of housing at all price points, that simply people have been unable to sort of make the math... Builders have been able to make the math pencil to build new housing of any kind, and so there's really an idea here that if we want to solve affordability, we have to spur more market rate and private housing. So it's interesting, particularly in a place like California. California has a democratic legislature, they have a democratic governor, and what we're seeing here is really like, \"Hey, a deregulatory thrust, let's actually get government out of the way a little bit so builders can build,\" and so I think that's interesting, because that's a little bit of a, hey, the Democrats in California maybe arguably attacking to the center. They're trying to say, \"Well, we can both focus on core liberal ideals and help with social safety nets, and also we want to make government work better and maybe get a little bit out of the way when we're achieving this kind of an important public policy purpose.\" So I think number one, it sort of signals like, hey, maybe there's a way to move more centrist, let's call it pro-business or pro-development kind of land use and supply reform laws to a place of California, and I think honestly, a lot of other states are watching what's happening right now in California. So if you're a governor in another state, particularly a democratic state that has long had a history of very strong environmental protections, I think you're looking at this and saying, \"Hey, I have an affordability crisis in my state. Should I also be revisiting some of the ways my environmental regulations have worked so that I can sort of have a both end? Both protect the environment, but also help get more housing built in the places where I know that the housing needs to go. Dana Taylor: Ben, some politicians are touting this as a solution to the housing crisis. Is that overblown, or will more legislation be needed to incentivize development? Ben Metcalf: I regret to say it's definitively overblown. I think this is a really important step. Like I said, I think it will absolutely speed up housing in California, which is really important. It will slightly lower costs and it will also reduce the uncertainty that comes from that sort of threat of litigation that I mentioned, but at the end of the day, it's still really expensive to build housing and really hard to build housing, and that has to do with a lot of factors that go well beyond this particular CEQA environmental policy. So until we can figure out ways to make it cheaper overall to build housing, until we can address issues like construction labor shortage, and incredible challenges with material pricing, and unless we can also figure out ways to achieve the life, safety and health benefits that we get from a very strong building code, it's still going to be very expensive to build that housing. So we have to figure out how to lower those. We also have to figure out how we can make sure that there are places where building is allowed, and particularly multifamily housing is allowed. Historically in California, there's been a very strong undercurrent of what's called NIMBYism. Not in my backyard. People saying, \"Hey, I don't want new housing in my neighborhood. It should go somewhere else.\" California has made some progress on that, but there's still more work that's needed to basically say to every city in town of California, we all sort of need to take our share of this growth and hopefully direct a lot of it into [inaudible 00:12:24] areas, and where that's not possible, make sure that it's happening and sort of compact, more accessible communities proximate to jobs and amenities. Dana Taylor: Finally, what's your biggest takeaway on the national crisis in affordable housing? Ben Metcalf: That this is a complicated one, but there's real dynamism right now, I think, coming from all sides of the political spectrum, to come up with real and meaningful fixes. So we have states like California that have Democrats controlling the legislature and the governorship, but we also have states like Montana, Utah, Arizona, which are Republican controlled, and we have exactly the same conversations going on, and exactly the same energy too. This is one of these rare issues that isn't super polarized where there really is a possibility for folks to work across the aisle and come up with creative solutions that involve both making it easier to get new housing built and coming up with some ways to really protect the most vulnerable residents who are really right now at real risk of homelessness or seeing their whole paychecks go into really substandard housing. So that's an opportunity, and I'm excited with things like what we saw in California to see where this momentum goes and see if it's augers, more of these sort of creative approaches to look at how we can have government work better.

That's where a 55-year-old regulation known as CEQA, the California Environmental Quality Act, has created a lengthy process, a review process that's been blamed for gumming up the developmental pipeline, but in June, in a move that angered environmentalists, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed two bills that effectively roll back portions of CEQA. What happens now, and will the impact finally pave the way for developers to create the housing so desperately needed?\n\nBen Metcalf, Managing Director of the Turner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley joins us to talk about what this might mean for housing in California. \n\nCEQA was one of a number of state-level sort of environmental protection laws that came into force in the early 1970s, at a time of real environmental activism and a time where there was a real concern that development had been running rampant, and buildings had been getting built in places that were dangerous potentially for the inhabitants or causing real harm to wildlife or habitat. The law itself is actually sort of ... on paper, seems very reasonable. It just asks developers of land to do a study, to basically look at their site before they build, and figure out what all of the environmental impacts are likely to be as a consequence of the specific structure that they plan to put there. The idea is that by documenting and disclosing these harms, there's a daylighting of the process that allows for local governments to decide if they want to ask for changes or for developers to make those changes.\n\nThat process has evolved over the last half a century into a bit of a complex regulatory system that has been very much criticized by folks in the building industry, because while it both serves that very valuable disclosure process, it also takes a lot of time to go through a public process of vetting that reporting, and it provides both a hook where local governments have sometimes used it to functionally block development, even though that wasn't the purpose, and it is a way by which any citizen can litigate, they can file lawsuits saying that that environmental review wasn't properly done. So it has been blamed as providing a effective veto to any citizen who's able to file a lawsuit.\n\nAfter signing the two bills, Newsom called it \"the most consequential housing reform that we've seen in modern history in the state of California\". Let's talk about likely impacts. What are you hearing from developers, and how long will people have to wait to see new housing take shape?\n\nSo what we do know probably with the most certainty is that all cohort of projects that are now sort of in their, what's called pre-development stage, they haven't yet started construction, but they're trying to get the approvals they need to begin building. A whole cohort of projects in that stage are going to be able to move forward faster and sooner. So if a typical environmental impact review that you would otherwise have to do is going to take four or five or six months, sometimes it takes quite a bit more, then that amount of your timeline is going to fall out. So projects that were sort of already in flight are going to get pulled forward and be able to get in the ground sooner.\n\nDo we know how long it's going to take before some of the actual development begins for this housing?\n\nSo I think we have a pretty good certainty that there's going to be a timing benefit for all of these in-fill residential projects in California going forward. I think what's a little bit less certain is does this induce new projects to get into the ground to go into development that didn't previously pencil or didn't make financial sense.\n\nOne group that's very unhappy with Newsom's move is environmentalists. What are their biggest concerns today?\n\nThey are very worried that by not doing this process of creating an environmental review, that we just won't know what we don't know, that we won't know if development is going forward in a place that does have a sensitive habitat or will cause significant impacts to other environmental concerns, whether it's air quality, water quality, or animal habitat.\n\nHow might Newsom's partial repeal kickstart the availability of affordable housing? Do the new laws address the need for more multi-family construction?\n\nWell, the primary beneficiary of this will be multifamily housing. In these infill locations, multifamily does comprise a larger share of net new residential housing than single family. Both some single family and multifamily both can benefit, but in practice it'll be more multifamily, and what we do know about multifamily housing is that even when it's not formally subsidized or officially \"affordable\", it does just tend to get priced at more accessible price points and tends to be smaller units.\n\nCalifornia is not alone in its struggles to create more affordable housing. Are there lessons for the rest of the country to be learned from California here?\n\nHistorically, the focus on affordable housing has manifested itself as \"let's create new affordable housing programs\", like \"let's build new public housing or pay for vouchers or low income housing tax credits.\" I think what's interesting here is there's this awareness that part of the reason, maybe the primary reason that the affordability crisis has gotten so bad is a function simply of a lack of housing at all price points, that simply people have been unable to sort of make the math...

    "text": "Published Jul 29, 2025 at 05:00 AM EDT U.S. News Reporter Universal or guaranteed basic income programs are gaining momentum across the country, as local governments and nonprofits experiment with the bold new alternative to traditional welfare models. According to Stanford University's Basic Income Lab, which tracks ongoing UBI or GBI pilot programs across the U.S., citizens in 18 states, as well as the District of Columbia, have taken part in some form of basic income study this year. \"UBI differs quite radically from welfare as we know it because it goes to all without means tests or work requirements,\" said Juliana Bidadanure, founder of the Basic Income Lab. \"It builds a robust floor that prevents all from falling too low, and it achieves that with a principle of radical inclusivity (everyone is opted in automatically).\" Neither UBI nor GBI programs have yet become a nationwide practice in any country, and their implementation will continue to be hindered by political and fiscal concerns some governments may have over providing citizens with unconditional payments. However, the studies that have been conducted have provided important data on the benefits and drawbacks of income guarantees for citizens, and could lead to further adoption in the future. Given that economies across the globe are faced with mounting inequality and the prospects of automation depriving millions of working opportunities, advocates believe that providing a basic income is an increasingly necessary means of ensuring financial security in the face of rapid economic shifts. According to the Stanford Basic Income Lab's tracker, 57 basic income experiments were ongoing as of late January, with over a dozen in California alone. While many have concluded, others remain ongoing, varying in payment amounts, recipients and intended purposes. One such experiment is currently being conducted by the Southern California non-profit Inland SoCal United Way in conjunction with the California Department of Social Services. The pilot program will provide unconditional cash payments of $600 per month for 18 months to hundreds of pregnant women in their first or second trimesters, as well as $750 per month to 21-year-olds who have spent time in the foster care system. Another is the Richmond Resilience Initiative, operated by the city's government and now in its fifth year, which focuses on providing support to those who serve as their household's primary caregiver. Participants receive $500 per month for a period of two years, and it is aimed at \"reducing financial instability for working families.\" Canadian health economist and basic income scholar Evelyn Forget told Newsweek that current welfare programs are plagued with bureaucratic obstacles and inefficiencies, issues she believes are made easier by an unconditional payment system like UBI. \"In North America, we have a range of social programs — most underfunded and virtually all 'conditional,'\" she said. \"These conditions, on their face, seem reasonable... In practice, many of these conditions are imposed in ways that make access to cash difficult: How do you 'prove' residency when you have no ID? How do you 'prove' an episodic mental illness? How do you access child support when you're the grandmother caring for the kids but their parents, who may be unreachable, have custody?\" Amy Castro, co-founder of the Center for Guaranteed Income Research at the University of Pennsylvania, said that the heightened interest in unconditional cash programs has been driven by \"pervasive economic strain.\" \"Americans are working more and making less to the detriment of our health, well-being, and relationships,\" she said. \"Living with chronic financial stress like not knowing if you will receive enough shifts at work to make rent drives poor public health outcomes, food insecurity and a range of mental health stressors.\" Castro added that the benefit of such programs is that cash \"is provided with no strings attached, no conditions on how the money can be spent,\" and that this can work alongside existing social safety nets. Based on data from over 30 basic income pilots across the U.S., the Stanford Basic Income Lab tracked how Americans spent the money they received through these programs. The majority of expenditures went toward retail sales and services. Food and groceries were the second-highest at 32 percent, followed by transport and housing/utilities, both at 9 percent. Juliana Bidadanure, founder of the Stanford Basic Income Lab, told Newsweek that a system of simple, unconditional payments \"suppresses bureaucratically burdensome eligibility tests and protects individuals in poverty from being subject to the discretionary power of state agents. It implements a real right to live free from abject poverty, no questions asked, no paperwork filed.\" \"The universal feature of UBI also makes it harder to demonize or stigmatize those on benefits,\" she added. \"This is important since a common feature of Western countries with targeted cash payment has been the stigmatization of benefits recipients as scroungers and welfare queens.\" Danny Avula, Mayor of Richmond, Virginia, upon launching the fifth Resilience Initiative basic income pilot, said: \"In Richmond, we believe everyone has a right to thrive, not just survive. The Richmond Resilience Initiative reflects our ongoing commitment to creating a city where families have the stability and support they need to build a better future.\" Amy Castro, co-founder of the Center for Guaranteed Income Research, told Newsweek: \"The advantage of cash is that it is flexible, fungible, and efficient—particularly when enduring an unexpected economic shock like a natural disaster or sudden drop in the market. Traditional safety net benefits like WIC, SNAP or housing supports require constant administrative recertification and are plagued by the benefits cliff where working families are penalized for every dollar they make above the income threshold.\" \"People spend tremendous amounts of time and cognitive bandwidth negotiating these cliffs to make sure they don't lose benefits crucial for surviving a risky economy,\" she added. \"This traps people at the poverty line because they must choose between a raise at work or an extra shift and potentially losing their benefits.\" © 2025 Newsweek Digital LLC",

    "text": "On December 15, 2017, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, issued a damning report on his visit to the United States. He cited data from the Stanford Center on Inequality and Poverty, which reports that “in terms of labor markets, poverty, safety net, wealth inequality, and economic mobility, the US comes in last of the top 10 most well-off countries, and 18th amongst the top 21.” Alston wrote that “the American Dream is rapidly becoming the American Illusion, as the US now has the lowest rate of social mobility of any of the rich countries.” Just a few days before, on December 11, The Boston Globe's Spotlight team ran a story showing that the median net worth of nonimmigrant African American households in the Boston area is $8, in contrast to the $247,500 net worth for white households in the Boston area. Clearly income disparity is ripping the nation apart, and none of the efforts or programs seeking to address it seems to be working. I myself have been, for the past couple of years, engaged in a broad discussion about the future of work with some thoughtful tech leaders and representatives of the Catholic Church who have similar concerns, and the notion of a universal basic income (UBI) keeps coming up. Like many of my friends who fiddle with ideas about the future of work, I’ve avoided actually having a firm opinion about UBI for years. Now I have decided it’s time to get my head around it. Touted as an elegant solution to the problem of poverty in America and the impending decimation of jobs by automation, UBI is a hot topic today in the “salons” hosted by tech and hedge-fund billionaires. The idea of UBI in fact is an old idea, older than me even: Either through direct cash payments or some sort of negative income tax, we should support people in need—or even everyone—to increase well-being and lift society overall. Interestingly, this notion has had broad support from conservatives like Milton Friedman and progressives such as Martin Luther King Jr. On the other hand, UBI also has been criticized by conservatives as well as liberals. Conservative proponents of UBI argue that it could shrink a huge array of costly social welfare services like health care, food assistance, and unemployment support by providing a simple, inexpensive way to let individuals, rather than the government, decide what to spend the money on. Liberals see it as a way to redistribute wealth and empower groups like stay-at-home parents, whose work doesn’t produce income—making them ineligible for unemployment benefits. In addition, these UBI advocates see it as a way to eliminate poverty. Nevertheless, just as many conservatives and liberals don’t like the concept. Conservatives against UBI worry that it will decrease incentives to work and cost too much, racking up a bill that those who do work will have to pay. Skeptical liberals worry that employers will use it as an excuse to pay even lower wages. They also fear politicians will offer it as a rationale to gut existing social programs and unwind institutions that help those most in need. The result is that UBI is a partisan issue that, paradoxically, has bipartisan support. I was on a panel at a recent conference when the moderator asked audience and panel members what they thought of UBI. The overwhelming consensus of the 500 or so people in the room appeared to be “we're skeptical, but should experiment.” UBI sounds like a good or not-so-good idea to different constituents because we have so little understanding of either how we would do it, or how people would react. None of us really knows what we’re talking about when it comes to UBI, akin to being in a drunken bar argument before there were smartphones and Wikipedia. But there are a few basic principles and pieces of research that can help. Much of the resurgent interest in UBI has come from Silicon Valley. Tech titans and the academics around them are concerned that the robots and artificial intelligence they’ve built will rapidly displace humans in the workforce, or at least push them into dead-end jobs. Some researchers say robots will replace the low-paying jobs people don’t want, while others maintain people will end up getting the worst jobs not worthy of robots. UBI may play a role in which scenario comes to pass. Last year, Elon Musk told the National Governors Association that job disruption caused by technology was “the scariest problem to me,” admitting that he had no easy solution. Musk and other entrepreneurs see UBI as way to provide a cushion and a buffer to give humans time to retrain themselves to do what robots can’t do. Some believe that it might even spawn a new wave of entrepreneurs, giving those displaced workers a shot at the American Dream. They may be getting ahead of themselves. Luke Martinelli, a researcher at the University of Bath Institute for Policy Research, has written that “an affordable UBI is inadequate, and an adequate UBI is unaffordable.” I believe that is roughly true. One of the biggest problems with UBI is that a base sum that would allow people to refuse work and look for something better (rather than just allowing employers to pay workers less) is around $1000 per month, which would cost most countries somewhere between 5 percent to 35 percent of their GDP. That looks expensive compared with the cost to any developed country of eradicating poverty, so the only way a nation could support this kind of UBI would be to eliminate all funding for social programs. That would be applauded by libertarians and some conservatives, but not by many others. Underpinning the Silicon Valley argument for UBI is the belief in exponential growth powered by science and technology, as described by Peter Diamandis in his book Abundance: The Future is Better Than You Think. Diamandis contends that technological progress, including gains in health, the power of computing, and the development of machine intelligence, among other things, will lead to a kind of technological transcendence that makes today’s society look like how we view the Dark Ages. He argues that the human mind is unable to intuitively grasp this idea, and so we constantly underestimate long-term effects. If you plot progress out a few decades, Diamandis writes, we end up with unimaginable abundance: “We will soon have the ability to meet and exceed the basic needs of every man, woman, and child on the planet. Abundance for all is within our grasp.” (Technologists often forget is that we actually already have enough food to feed the world; the problem is that it’s just not properly distributed.) Many tech billionaires think they can have their cake and eat it too, that they are so rich and smart the trickle-down theory can lift the poor out of poverty without anyone or anything suffering. And why shouldn’t they think so? Their companies and their wealth have grown exponentially, and it doesn’t appear as though there is any end in sight, as Marc Andreessen prophetically predicted in his famous essay, “Why Software is Eating the World.” Most of Silicon Valley’s leaders gained their wealth in an exponentially growing market without having to engage in the aggressive tactics that marked the creation of wealth in the past. They feel their businesses inherently “do good,” and that, I believe, allows them to feel more charitable, broadly speaking. If the technologists are correct and automation is going to substantially increase US GDP, then who better to figure out what to do about the associated problems than the technologists themselves—or so their thinking goes. Tech leaders are underwriting experiments and financing research on UBI to prepare for a future that will allow them and their companies to continue in ascendance while keeping society stable. (Various localities and organizations already have experimented with forms of UBI over the years. In some cases, they have produced evidence that people receiving UBI do in fact continue to work, and that UBI gives people the ability to quit lousy jobs and look for better ones, or complete or go back to school.) Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator, has a project to give people free money and see what happens to them over time, for instance. Altman's experiment, prosaically named the Basic Income Project, will involve 3,000 people in two states over five years. Some 1,000 of them will be given $1,000 a month, and the rest will get just $50 a month and serve as a sort of control group. It should reveal some important information about how people will behave when given free money, providing an evidence-based way to think about UBI—we don’t have much of that evidence now. Among the questions hopefully to be answered: Will people use the cushion of free money to look for better work? Will they go back to school for retraining? Will neurological development of children improve? Will crime rates go down? As with many ideas with diverse support at high levels, the particulars of execution can make or break UBI in practice. Take the recent, much heralded UBI experiment in Finland. A Finnish welfare agency, Kela, and a group of researchers proposed paying between 550 and 700 euros a month to both workers and nonworkers around that country. Finland’s conservative government then began tweaking the proposal, most importantly eliminating the part of the plan that paid people who had jobs, and only providing UBI for those receiving unemployment benefits instead. It had no interest in whether UBI would allow people to look for better jobs or to train themselves for the jobs of the future. The government declared that the “primary goal of the basic income experiment is related to promoting employment.” And so what started as a credible experiment in empowering labor and liberal values became a conservative program to get more people to go back to crappy jobs—and a great warning about the impact that politics can have on efforts to test or deploy UBI. (We must wait until 2019 to see the full extent of the outcome.) Chris Hughes, a cofounder of Facebook and not-quite-billionaire, is the person I found with a plan for UBI that’s halfway between Silicon Valley’s techno-utopian vision and the vision held by the liberal East Coast types that I mostly hang out with these days. His new book Fair Shot: Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn outlines his views on UBI, but here’s my brief version of what Hughes is thinking: He believes we can do UBI now. He says we can “provide every single American stability through cash” by providing a monthly $500 supplement to lower-middle income taxpayers through the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC. He would expand EITC to include child care, elder care, and education as types of work that would be eligible for EITC. (Currently if the jobs are unpaid jobs, they are not eligible.) Hughes contends that this would cut poverty in America by half. According to his numbers, right now the EITC costs the US $70 billion a year, and his UBI proposal would tack on an additional $290 billion. Citing research by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman showing that less than 1 percent of Americans control as much wealth as 90 percent of Americans, Hughes' plan to pay for that expansion involves increasing the income tax for the top 1 percent, or people earning more than $250,000 a year, to 50 percent from 35 percent, and treating capital gains as income—moving long-term capital gains from 20 percent to 50 percent, hitting the wealthiest the hardest. He’s putting his money where his mouth is too, underwriting a project that will give $500 a month to residents of Stockton, California. Will UBI save America? Our Congress and president just passed a tax law that reduces taxes on the country’s wealthiest, but I still think Hughes' proposal is reasonable in part because EITC is a pretty popular program. My fear is that the current political climate and our ability to discuss things rationally are severely impaired, and that's without factoring in the usual challenges of turning rational ideas into law. In the meantime, it’s great that Silicon Valley billionaires have recognized the potential negative impact of their businesses and are looking at and funding experiments to provide better evidence-based understanding of UBI, even if evidence appears to have less and less currency in today’s world. Am I optimistic? No. Should we get cracking on trying everything we can, and is UBI a decent shot on goal? Yes and yes. Photograph by WIRED/Getty Images   © 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

    "onlytext": "On December 15, 2017, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, issued a damning report on his visit to the United States. He cited data from the Stanford Center on Inequality and Poverty, which reports that “in terms of labor markets, poverty, safety net, wealth inequality, and economic mobility, the US comes in last of the top 10 most well-off countries, and 18th amongst the top 21.” Alston wrote that “the American Dream is rapidly becoming the American Illusion, as the US now has the lowest rate of social mobility of any of the rich countries.” \n\nJust a few days before, on December 11, The Boston Globe's Spotlight team ran a story showing that the median net worth of nonimmigrant African American households in the Boston area is $8, in contrast to the $247,500 net worth for white households in the Boston area. Clearly income disparity is ripping the nation apart, and none of the efforts or programs seeking to address it seems to be working.\n\nI myself have been, for the past couple of years, engaged in a broad discussion about the future of work with some thoughtful tech leaders and representatives of the Catholic Church who have similar concerns, and the notion of a universal basic income (UBI) keeps coming up. Like many of my friends who fiddle with ideas about the future of work, I’ve avoided actually having a firm opinion about UBI for years. Now I have decided it’s time to get my head around it.\n\nTouted as an elegant solution to the problem of poverty in America and the impending decimation of jobs by automation, UBI is a hot topic today in the “salons” hosted by tech and hedge-fund billionaires. The idea of UBI in fact is an old idea, older than me even: Either through direct cash payments or some sort of negative income tax, we should support people in need—or even everyone—to increase well-being and lift society overall. \n\nInterestingly, this notion has had broad support from conservatives like Milton Friedman and progressives such as Martin Luther King Jr. On the other hand, UBI also has been criticized by conservatives as well as liberals. Conservative proponents of UBI argue that it could shrink a huge array of costly social welfare services like health care, food assistance, and unemployment support by providing a simple, inexpensive way to let individuals, rather than the government, decide what to spend the money on.\n\nLiberals see it as a way to redistribute wealth and empower groups like stay-at-home parents, whose work doesn’t produce income—making them ineligible for unemployment benefits. In addition, these UBI advocates see it as a way to eliminate poverty. Nevertheless, just as many conservatives and liberals don’t like the concept.\n\nConservatives against UBI worry that it will decrease incentives to work and cost too much, racking up a bill that those who do work will have to pay. Skeptical liberals worry that employers will use it as an excuse to pay even lower wages. They also fear politicians will offer it as a rationale to gut existing social programs and unwind institutions that help those most in need.\n\nThe result is that UBI is a partisan issue that, paradoxically, has bipartisan support. I was on a panel at a recent conference when the moderator asked audience and panel members what they thought of UBI. The overwhelming consensus of the 500 or so people in the room appeared to be “we're skeptical, but should experiment.”\n\nUBI sounds like a good or not-so-good idea to different constituents because we have so little understanding of either how we would do it, or how people would react. None of us really knows what we’re talking about when it comes to UBI, akin to being in a drunken bar argument before there were smartphones and Wikipedia.\n\nBut there are a few basic principles and pieces of research that can help. Much of the resurgent interest in UBI has come from Silicon Valley. Tech titans and the academics around them are concerned that the robots and artificial intelligence they’ve built will rapidly displace humans in the workforce, or at least push them into dead-end jobs.\n\nSome researchers say robots will replace the low-paying jobs people don’t want, while others maintain people will end up getting the worst jobs not worthy of robots. UBI may play a role in which scenario comes to pass. Last year, Elon Musk told the National Governors Association that job disruption caused by technology was “the scariest problem to me,” admitting that he had no easy solution.\n\nMusk and other entrepreneurs see UBI as way to provide a cushion and a buffer to give humans time to retrain themselves to do what robots can’t do. Some believe that it might even spawn a new wave of entrepreneurs, giving those displaced workers a shot at the American Dream. They may be getting ahead of themselves.\n\nLuke Martinelli, a researcher at the University of Bath Institute for Policy Research, has written that “an affordable UBI is inadequate, and an adequate UBI is unaffordable.” I believe that is roughly true. One of the biggest problems with UBI is that a base sum that would allow people to refuse work and look for something better (rather than just allowing employers to pay workers less) is around $1000 per month, which would cost most countries somewhere between 5 percent to 35 percent of their GDP.\n\nThat looks expensive compared with the cost to any developed country of eradicating poverty, so the only way a nation could support this kind of UBI would be to eliminate all funding for social programs. That would be applauded by libertarians and some conservatives, but not by many others.\n\nUnderpinning the Silicon Valley argument for UBI is the belief in exponential growth powered by science and technology, as described by Peter Diamandis in his book Abundance: The Future is Better Than You Think.

Here’s How People Spend It  Pilot programs across the U.S., including new research funded by OpenAI, offer a glimpse of how a universal basic income could improve lives By Allison Parshall edited by Ben Guarino & Clara Moskowitz Shideh Ghandeharizadeh In 2020, amid widespread layoffs and economic turmoil brought on by the COVID pandemic, 1,000 low-income people in Texas and Illinois won something of a lottery. They were selected to receive $1,000 per month—with no strings attached—for three years as part of a study on guaranteed income by OpenResearch, a nonprofit research organization funded in part by OpenAI and its founder, Sam Altman. Silicon Valley philanthropists are just one piece of a growing movement for using basic income to improve people’s lives. In recent years the Stanford Basic Income Lab and the Center for Guaranteed Income Research have been tracking 30-plus pilot programs that have tested basic income in towns and cities across the U.S. “There’s a long history of interest in basic income in the United States,” says Sara Kimberlin, executive director of the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality. Founding father Thomas Paine advocated for it in The Rights of Man. Martin Luther King, Jr., called it the solution to poverty. Even economist and free-market capitalist Milton Friedman suggested basic income in the form of a “negative income tax.” If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

When people receive unconditional cash, they tend to use the money in ways that increase their financial security and housing stability, Kimberlin says, pointing to a “large body of research.” Those observations line up with the most recent results from OpenResearch, which showed that participants increased spending to meet their basic needs and to help family and friends. A separate study published online in July in the Journal of the American Medical Association also found that cash benefits reduced emergency room visits. \"Cash is flexible. It gives people a lot of dignity and autonomy in deciding how they are going to use it.\" —Sara Kimberlin Taken as a whole, the evidence suggests that when people’s most basic needs are met, they start to build a firmer financial foundation for themselves and their family. Scientific American spoke with Kimberlin to learn more about these basic-­income pilot programs and how this unconditional, guaranteed aid improves people’s lives. An edited transcript of the interview follows. What is the promise of basic income? A key problem that basic income or guaranteed income is designed to address is the significant share of people and families who don’t have enough resources to be able to meet their essential needs. And we have a lot of research that shows the challenges that arise from struggling to meet your basic needs. For example, if you don’t have access to stable, safe housing, health care or food, that interferes with your ability to be a productive worker or to take care of your family. And if you’re a child, that interferes with your ability to concentrate in school. On the flip side, there’s a lot of research showing the positive things that happen when a policy ensures people’s needs can be met. It shows that when food stamps are introduced in a particular area, the outcomes for the families improve. Other research shows that children whose families received the Earned Income Tax Credit when they were young had more positive long-term educational outcomes, which translated to stronger financial security later in life. Why provide cash, as opposed to food stamps or rent assistance? Cash is flexible. People can use it to meet whatever their most pressing need may be. It’s an efficient way of addressing people’s needs, and it also gives people a lot of dignity and autonomy in deciding how they’re going to use it. It helps to avoid situations where someone may already have resources designated to pay for food but needs, for example, emergency child care. If they don’t get it, then they can’t get to their job, which could cause a lot of disruption down the line by making them miss a paycheck, then miss the rent. You can look at unconditional cash as a potentially very promising way of approaching social support because it streamlines the administrative costs and makes it easier for people to access the support they are eligible for. What stood out for you about the new findings from OpenResearch?  It’s a very large study, and it’s well designed and well funded. It studied a fairly broad, more representative population, rather than being targeted to a specific group such as parents of young children, which meant there was a lot of variation in the outcomes. It wasn’t surprising that the study found the most common uses of the funds were to cover basic needs such as housing, food and transportation. This is something we see consistently across guaranteed-income pilots that are tracked on the Guaranteed Income Pilots Dashboard on the Stanford Basic Income Lab website. Something that stood out for me was the significant increase in people spending money to help their friends and family. That struck me because it means there are some effects of this program that are not fully captured in the results. If a participant is saying, “Oh, my cousin called me because her husband lost his job, and they can’t make their rent this month, and I gave her some money so her family wouldn’t get evicted”—outcomes like that wouldn’t be fully captured in the participant data. There’s a ripple of positive effects that are going out beyond the direct recipient. People who received the cash worked an average of one hour less per week and were 2 percent less likely to be employed than people in a control group that received $50. What does that tell you?  People wonder: Does receiving unrestricted cash mean people are going to just stop working? How would that affect the labor market? There have been different findings across different studies. Some have shown somewhat increased employment. You can imagine how that’s possible. If receiving a basic income allows you to repair your car so that it’s reliable or pay for child care, that might make it more possible for you to get a job. There have also been studies that have shown no significant impact on employment. And then there have been studies that show some reductions in employment or in number of hours worked compared with a control group. That’s what was found in these OpenResearch results. One important piece of context here is that this study, along with many of the studies in this recent crop of guaranteed-income pilots, took place in the unusual economic setting of the pandemic. Unemployment was very high across the entire U.S. in both the treatment and the control group at the beginning of this study. Over the course of the three years lots of people in both groups went out and got jobs as more jobs became available again—overall, employment and hours worked increased in both groups, but they increased less in the group receiving $1,000. Many of the drivers that might cause somebody to work less when they receive a basic income could be seen as positive outcomes in other ways. For example, single parents or parents of young children might work fewer hours to spend more time directly caring for their children. Is just giving people money really a viable solution to poverty? Basic income, particularly at this scale that has been studied, is not a cure-all or magical solution to poverty. Access to health care, schooling, child care and affordable housing are still needed. I think it makes sense to think about basic income as a promising intervention that complements other parts of the social safety net. Unrestricted cash has a lot of power to be able to fill in places where the safety net is inadequate. What are some open questions about the impacts of basic income that you hope more research will answer? It’s really important to study how these programs work for different groups of people. There are different pilots focused on specific populations, such as people aging out of foster care, people experiencing domestic violence or people reentering society after incarceration. Understanding how it works for different groups is helpful for designing programs and policies. And a critical question is: What are the long-term effects of these programs, in particular on people’s health? A three-year study can’t address health problems that have developed over people’s lifetime. But if you had a long-term program in place, would you see different effects on people’s health, such as on chronic health conditions? And studying the potential effects of these programs on children’s long-term trajectories is very important. Some of those outcomes are not measurable yet, but they may be quite consequential for the people who receive the money and may ripple out to their families and communities.

It helps to avoid situations where someone may already have resources designated to pay for food but needs, for example, emergency child care. If they don’t get it, then they can’t get to their job, which could cause a lot of disruption down the line by making them miss a paycheck, then miss the rent. You can look at unconditional cash as a potentially very promising way of approaching social support because it streamlines the administrative costs and makes it easier for people to access the support they are eligible for.\n\nWhat stood out for you about the new findings from OpenResearch? \nIt’s a very large study, and it’s well designed and well funded. It studied a fairly broad, more representative population, rather than being targeted to a specific group such as parents of young children, which meant there was a lot of variation in the outcomes. It wasn’t surprising that the study found the most common uses of the funds were to cover basic needs such as housing, food and transportation. This is something we see consistently across guaranteed-income pilots that are tracked on the Guaranteed Income Pilots Dashboard on the Stanford Basic Income Lab website.\n\nSomething that stood out for me was the significant increase in people spending money to help their friends and family. That struck me because it means there are some effects of this program that are not fully captured in the results. If a participant is saying, “Oh, my cousin called me because her husband lost his job, and they can’t make their rent this month, and I gave her some money so her family wouldn’t get evicted”—outcomes like that wouldn’t be fully captured in the participant data. There’s a ripple of positive effects that are going out beyond the direct recipient.\n\nPeople who received the cash worked an average of one hour less per week and were 2 percent less likely to be employed than people in a control group that received $50. \nWhat does that tell you? \nPeople wonder: Does receiving unrestricted cash mean people are going to just stop working? How would that affect the labor market? There have been different findings across different studies. Some have shown somewhat increased employment. You can imagine how that’s possible. If receiving a basic income allows you to repair your car so that it’s reliable or pay for child care, that might make it more possible for you to get a job. There have also been studies that have shown no significant impact on employment. And then there have been studies that show some reductions in employment or in number of hours worked compared with a control group. That’s what was found in these OpenResearch results.\n\nOne important piece of context here is that this study, along with many of the studies in this recent crop of guaranteed-income pilots, took place in the unusual economic setting of the pandemic. Unemployment was very high across the entire U.S. in both the treatment and the control group at the beginning of this study. Over the course of the three years lots of people in both groups went out and got jobs as more jobs became available again—overall, employment and hours worked increased in both groups, but they increased less in the group receiving $1,000.\n\nMany of the drivers that might cause somebody to work less when they receive a basic income could be seen as positive outcomes in other ways. For example, single parents or parents of young children might work fewer hours to spend more time directly caring for their children.\n\nIs just giving people money really a viable solution to poverty? \nBasic income, particularly at this scale that has been studied, is not a cure-all or magical solution to poverty. Access to health care, schooling, child care and affordable housing are still needed. I think it makes sense to think about basic income as a promising intervention that complements other parts of the social safety net. Unrestricted cash has a lot of power to be able to fill in places where the safety net is inadequate.\n\nWhat are some open questions about the impacts of basic income that you hope more research will answer? \nIt’s really important to study how these programs work for different groups of people. There are different pilots focused on specific populations, such as people aging out of foster care, people experiencing domestic violence or people reentering society after incarceration. Understanding how it works for different groups is helpful for designing programs and policies. \n\nAnd a critical question is: What are the long-term effects of these programs, in particular on people’s health? A three-year study can’t address health problems that have developed over people’s lifetime. But if you had a long-term program in place, would you see different effects on people’s health, such as on chronic health conditions? And studying the potential effects of these programs on children’s long-term trajectories is very important. Some of those outcomes are not measurable yet, but they may be quite consequential for the people who receive the money and may ripple out to their families and communities.",

    "text": "Last October, a fire tore through the apartment complex in Stockton, California, where Laura Kidd-Plummer had lived for five years. Nearly a decade earlier, Kidd-Plummer, who will turn seventy this year, had retired from her job in the wardrobe department at the Oakland Coliseum, where she had worked for twenty-one years. She eventually moved to Stockton in search of cheaper rent. After the fire, she and her dog, Poopee, a Pomeranian-Yorkie mix, were left homeless. Ever since, she told me, “I’m just trying to keep my head above water.” She stayed in a motel for a couple of months, which was covered by insurance, and then with acquaintances. In May, she moved into a loft in North Stockton. She was able to make the deposit on the apartment using funds she has received as a participant in the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, or SEED, a basic-income pilot program that has provided unconditional cash transfers of five hundred dollars per month to individuals over the last year and a half. Before SEED, Kidd-Plummer “had credit cards and had to use them to eat,” she said, because she was only eligible for sixteen dollars per month through food stamps. Now she’s able to cover food. “I’ve always worked, so most programs I’m not eligible for,” she told me. “I didn’t expect to be chosen. When I got the letter in the mail, I was floored.” The program, spearheaded by Stockton’s mayor, Michael Tubbs, was scheduled to end this summer: this month’s payment was slated to be the last. In late May, Tubbs announced that SEED would be extended through January, 2021, in response to the economic strain put on participants by the coronavirus pandemic. While the idea of extending the program had been under discussion even before the spread of COVID-19, Tubbs told me that current conditions made doing so a “moral imperative,” as many participants have lost work, and those classified as essential workers face increased risk. “COVID-19 has put the focus on the fact that a lot of Americans live in constant moments of economic disruption, because the fundamentals of the economy haven’t been working,” he told me. Tubbs, who is twenty-nine, is Stockton’s first Black mayor, and its youngest ever. After four years serving on the city council, he ran for mayor on a platform focussed on recovery from the 2008 crash, and was elected, in 2016, with seventy per cent of the vote, defeating an incumbent plagued by a string of scandals. SEED has relied on significant outside funding, as have several other projects that Tubbs has pursued, including an education initiative that has been run on a twenty-million-dollar private donation. Tubbs first encountered the concept of a universal basic income, or U.B.I., while he was an undergraduate at Stanford, in 2009, in a course that covered Martin Luther King, Jr.,’s advocacy for the idea late in his life. The possibility of issuing unconditional payments to a group of Stockton residents came up soon after Tubbs took office, in 2017, as a part of his staff’s research project on addressing poverty. Twenty per cent of Stockton’s residents fall below the poverty line, which is well above the state average, and residents of color are disproportionately affected. Still, Tubbs was initially skeptical—he worried about funding and thought that the idea could prove unpopular with voters. “This was my first time being elected,” he told me. “I didn’t want it to be my last.” The plan started to take shape, though, when Tubbs met Natalie Foster, a co-chair of the Economic Security Project, a basic-income advocacy group launched with the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. The organization was looking for a city in which to test a pilot, and gave Stockton a million-dollar grant. (The program’s extension will be funded separately, through a private donation.) The funding allowed a hundred and twenty-five participants each to receive five hundred dollars a month, an amount that was based on data indicating that around forty per cent of Americans can’t afford a four-hundred-dollar emergency expense. A hundred recipients in the program are anonymous, while the rest, including Kidd-Plummer, have volunteered to speak publicly about their experience. The study set out to prove that a basic income could, according to the research plan, “lead to reductions in monthly income volatility and provide greater income sufficiency, which will in turn lead to reduced psychological stress and improved physical functioning.” A random sample of residents in neighborhoods with populations that are at or below Stockton’s median income level were contacted. Around forty-three per cent of those who were chosen reported being employed either full or part time. Ten per cent of them are caregivers, a group that often fails to qualify for unemployment and other benefits. Tubbs told me that he doesn’t see a basic income as particularly radical but, instead, as “this generation’s extension of the safety net,” following in the path of things like Social Security, child-labor laws, weekends, and collective bargaining. Two professors of social work, Amy Castro Baker, of the University of Pennsylvania, and Stacia Martin-West, of the University of Tennessee, who have conducted research together on the gender and racial wealth gaps, were brought on to help design the pilot and evaluate the results. Stockton, they told me, was an ideal location: as of 2018, it was the most diverse city in the country; many of its residents moved from more expensive parts of the Bay Area and continue to commute into those cities for low-paying jobs; and it is, historically, the foreclosure capital of the United States. In designing the logistics of the program, they emphasized “rethinking our safety net with an anchor of justice and dignity,” as Castro Baker put it, while addressing “inequality predicated on racism and sexism.” Each month, participants receive payments on a debit card, which the researchers are able to track. No restrictions are placed on what the money can be used for; if participants don’t want their expenses tracked or prefer to use cash, they can transfer the money off the card. Castro Baker and Martin-West have also been studying the well-being of people in a control group who did not receive payments. Members of both groups complete monthly check-ins, during which they provide updates and summarize their mental state by using emojis. During the study, the researchers have released data on an online dashboard, where observers can read stories from participants and see spending trends change over time. For example, during the pandemic, the percentage of money that participants spent on food, consistently the largest category, reached nearly twenty-five per cent over the monthly average, while the amount spent on recreation dropped to less than two per cent. Participants have also put the money toward rent, car payments, and paying off debt, as well as one-off expenses for themselves or their children: dental surgery, a prom dress, football camp, and shoes. They’ve also been able to cut back on working second and third jobs; one participant, a forty-eight-year-old mother of two who works full time at Tesla, was able to stop working as a delivery driver for DoorDash. Alcohol and tobacco have accounted for less than one per cent of spending per month. Since SEED was launched, the idea of a basic income, which has long been considered a fringe idea, has gained at least provisional support from the Pope, Jack Dorsey, and Nancy Pelosi. Andrew Yang made U.B.I. a centerpiece of his Presidential campaign. More recently, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which is estimated to have kept twelve million people from sinking into poverty, included direct cash payments to every American with an annual income below seventy-five thousand dollars, and there are currently eight bills in Congress proposing some form of additional cash transfer to back up the checks that have already gone out. In May, eighty-four members of Congress signed a joint letter asking that monthly direct payments be included in future relief bills as “the most efficient mechanism for delivering economic relief to those most at-risk in this crisis.” Jennifer Burns, a history professor at Stanford University, told me that the bipartisan support for the CARES Act marked a significant shift in thinking about cash transfers. Although both Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon briefly considered forms of U.B.I.—Johnson as part of the War on Poverty, and Nixon as an element of the Family Assistance Plan—cash transfers have not, historically, been a widely popular political idea. Nixon’s proposal, which failed to pass in the Senate, was criticized on the right for “rewarding wasteful behavior,” as Burns put it, and on the left for endangering existing programs. Ultimately, the idea was adapted to become the Earned Income Tax Credit, a system of rebates for low-income Americans that has some similarities to a basic-income program but is conditioned on work. Recent calls for U.B.I. have mostly come from Silicon Valley, where libertarian-leaning entrepreneurs embraced the concept as a quick fix for job losses due to increased automation. According to Burns, the current crisis has shifted the focus away from hypothetical disasters toward inequities that already exist. In her view, the automation argument is primarily a distraction, but “if worrying about A.I. helps people look around and think about what’s already under way, that’s good.” The goal of SEED was always to promote the adoption of basic-income programs on a state or federal level, rather than to lay the groundwork for a long-term program in Stockton. Now, as the program moves into its final stretch, its creators have been flooded with requests for advice from pilot programs in development in other cities, including Seattle, Portland, Chicago, Newark, Nashville, and New Orleans. Last month, the U.S. Conference of Mayors adopted a resolution, led by Tubbs, that urges “cities, states, and the federal government to explore the feasibility of a guaranteed income” in response to the way in which “COVID-19 has shed light on economic insecurity and exposed the vulnerability of our current welfare system.” Shenna Bellows, a state senator in Maine who is leading a study committee on U.B.I., told me that, in recent months, her constituents “have really struggled with the byzantine unemployment and small-business-relief programs,” and she hopes “this crisis will point the way to simpler solutions.” Tubbs believes that the potential for a federal cash-transfer program hinges, primarily, on political will. “This country has a history of finding ways to pay for things that we say matter,” he told me. According to Hilary Hoynes, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, the annual cost of a truly universal federal-basic-income program in the U.S. would be around three trillion dollars, which is approximately three-fifths of current total federal expenditures. She believes that a more viable model could, at least initially, be structured like the CARES Act and SEED, with an income cutoff set considerably higher than those of current welfare programs. (Around eighty per cent of Stockton residents were eligible to take part in SEED.) Though this model falls short of universality, it would address a key failing in what’s currently available. As Hoynes put it, “more and more of the assistance that’s provided in America is conditional, and, as is very evident right now, programs that are conditioned on work aren’t helpful where work isn’t plentiful.” Burns told me that, even if discussion of U.B.I. drops off, its opponents “have had to at least engage with the idea, because it met so many of the needs of the crisis.”   © 2025 Condé Nast.

    "title": "DOGE slashes key housing inspection contract, putting some low-income families at risk",
    "domain": "abcnews.go.com",
    "text": "Experts warn that the cuts may harm vulnerable Americans. A contract to inspect low-income and other assisted housing for gas leaks, faulty smoke detectors and other life-threatening deficiencies was terminated by the Trump administration in February as part of its cost-cutting efforts, according to a Department of Government Efficiency database, potentially leaving thousands of vulnerable Americans in harm's way. Tom Feehan, a veteran home inspector who lost work as part of the termination, told ABC News that these legally required inspections frequently uncover painted-over ceiling sprinklers, defective gas ranges and any number of home-related liabilities that can pose a danger to occupants. \"By not doing [the inspections], we're not catching those,\" Feehan said. \"So those are not being repaired, and it's putting people at risk.\" Last year, the contractor, Project Solutions Inc., in its third year of working with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, was assigned to inspect roughly 6,200 public housing and multifamily properties across the country over the course of 12 months. In addition to flagging dangerous conditions, the inspections ensure that tenants have hot and cold water, safe electrical outlets, and working heating and cooling systems, experts said. A HUD official told ABC News that the contract was for \"software modification,\" despite Project Solutions identifying the contract as being for inspection services. The HUD official declined to elaborate on the reason behind the contract's termination. The sudden termination threatens thousands of inspections, according to Robin Miller, a contract manager at Project Solutions, including those at roughly 250 \"priority\" properties, where inspections were already delayed or significant deficiencies were found during previous inspections. Project Solution's contract termination was among more than 7,000 federal contracts canceled by DOGE and posted to the agency's \"Wall of Receipts\" web page in recent weeks. The DOGE site claimed that terminating the inspection contract would return $285 million to taxpayers. But Miller, the Project Solutions official, said that figure was inflated because it was based on a high estimated ceiling value that wasn't reflective of what the contract would actually cost. According to federal spending records, HUD had only awarded Project Solutions roughly $29 million so far. Experts said it was unclear how housing officials planned to carry out the outstanding inspections. HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett said in a statement that \"HUD is reviewing all contracts for efficiency and effectiveness to accomplish good government goals,\" and that \"certain contracts were found not to accomplish HUD's mission with economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.\" Industry experts said that the inspections, which are required by law, will likely fall to other contractors at a similar price. But arranging those inspections will take time, experts said, and delaying inspections compounds the risks for tenants. \"We're helping low-income people and we're helping senior citizens maintain a safe, livable environment,\" Feehan said. \"And with not getting these inspections done on time, it's hurting them.\" Another HUD-certified inspector based in Illinois, who asked that their name not be used so they could speak freely about their field of work, told ABC News that one of the properties that was scheduled to be inspected until the Project Solutions contract was canceled was a 24-unit multifamily property that had received far below the \"failing\" score, meaning significant deficiencies were found during its previous inspection and the property needed more frequent inspections. The property was already past due its Dec. 13, 2024, inspection date, and its inspection has yet to be rescheduled, the inspector said. Project Solutions was one of at least three contractors that were hired to inspect HUD-insured and assisted properties under the agency's Real Estate Assessment Center program, which is aimed at \"improving housing quality by performing accurate, credible, and reliable assessments\" of its properties. \"I 100% agree that all governments, all organizations, businesses, even personal family units, should routinely review budget and spending habits and cut things out that are not necessary,\" the Illinois inspector said. \"Get rid of the fraud, waste abuse -- but you have to be responsible about it.\" \"If it wasn't for DOGE, we'd still be doing the contract. That's my opinion,\" Feehan said. \"DOGE is trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse. I didn't see where there was waste fraud and abuse with PSI.\" Alia Trindle, co-director of political strategy at housing advocacy group Right to the City Alliance, stressed that many HUD-funded buildings have been in dire shape for decades due to past funding cuts.

    "onlytext": "Experts warn that the cuts may harm vulnerable Americans. A contract to inspect low-income and other assisted housing for gas leaks, faulty smoke detectors and other life-threatening deficiencies was terminated by the Trump administration in February as part of its cost-cutting efforts, according to a Department of Government Efficiency database, potentially leaving thousands of vulnerable Americans in harm's way. Tom Feehan, a veteran home inspector who lost work as part of the termination, told ABC News that these legally required inspections frequently uncover painted-over ceiling sprinklers, defective gas ranges and any number of home-related liabilities that can pose a danger to occupants. \"By not doing [the inspections], we're not catching those,\" Feehan said. \"So those are not being repaired, and it's putting people at risk.\" Last year, the contractor, Project Solutions Inc., in its third year of working with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, was assigned to inspect roughly 6,200 public housing and multifamily properties across the country over the course of 12 months. In addition to flagging dangerous conditions, the inspections ensure that tenants have hot and cold water, safe electrical outlets, and working heating and cooling systems, experts said. A HUD official told ABC News that the contract was for \"software modification,\" despite Project Solutions identifying the contract as being for inspection services. The HUD official declined to elaborate on the reason behind the contract's termination. The sudden termination threatens thousands of inspections, according to Robin Miller, a contract manager at Project Solutions, including those at roughly 250 \"priority\" properties, where inspections were already delayed or significant deficiencies were found during previous inspections. Project Solution's contract termination was among more than 7,000 federal contracts canceled by DOGE and posted to the agency's \"Wall of Receipts\" web page in recent weeks. The DOGE site claimed that terminating the inspection contract would return $285 million to taxpayers. But Miller, the Project Solutions official, said that figure was inflated because it was based on a high estimated ceiling value that wasn't reflective of what the contract would actually cost. According to federal spending records, HUD had only awarded Project Solutions roughly $29 million so far. Experts said it was unclear how housing officials planned to carry out the outstanding inspections. HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett said in a statement that \"HUD is reviewing all contracts for efficiency and effectiveness to accomplish good government goals,\" and that \"certain contracts were found not to accomplish HUD's mission with economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.\" Industry experts said that the inspections, which are required by law, will likely fall to other contractors at a similar price. But arranging those inspections will take time, experts said, and delaying inspections compounds the risks for tenants. \"We're helping low-income people and we're helping senior citizens maintain a safe, livable environment,\" Feehan said. \"And with not getting these inspections done on time, it's hurting them.\" Another HUD-certified inspector based in Illinois, who asked that their name not be used so they could speak freely about their field of work, told ABC News that one of the properties that was scheduled to be inspected until the Project Solutions contract was canceled was a 24-unit multifamily property that had received far below the \"failing\" score, meaning significant deficiencies were found during its previous inspection and the property needed more frequent inspections. The property was already past due its Dec. 13, 2024, inspection date, and its inspection has yet to be rescheduled, the inspector said. Project Solutions was one of at least three contractors that were hired to inspect HUD-insured and assisted properties under the agency's Real Estate Assessment Center program, which is aimed at \"improving housing quality by performing accurate, credible, and reliable assessments\" of its properties. \"I 100% agree that all governments, all organizations, businesses, even personal family units, should routinely review budget and spending habits and cut things out that are not necessary,\" the Illinois inspector said. \"Get rid of the fraud, waste abuse -- but you have to be responsible about it.\" \"If it wasn't for DOGE, we'd still be doing the contract. That's my opinion,\" Feehan said. \"DOGE is trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse. I didn't see where there was waste fraud and abuse with PSI.\" Alia Trindle, co-director of political strategy at housing advocacy group Right to the City Alliance, stressed that many HUD-funded buildings have been in dire shape for decades due to past funding cuts. She said for some properties, tenants and advocates have had to organize to push for basic repairs after years of neglect. \"Working-class and poor communities have to contend with substandard and neglected housing that could have devastating long-term health consequences for those that live there, from mold to pest to a lack of access to basic utilities like water and heat,\" Trindle said. \"So regular inspections, whether done by HUD or HUD-affiliated groups or by municipalities, are critical to ensuring that those who are responsible for this housing stock do the bare minimum to maintain them,\" she said.

María Lara and her 10-year-old daughter, Ashley, live in Langley Park, Md., a densely populated, low-income suburb of Washington, D.C. She says the worst part about living in the Bedford and Victoria Station complex, a multifamily residential property, is that she and her daughter don't feel safe. \"These apartments are rotten,\" Lara says, because the place is \"roach- and mice-infested, water leaks everywhere, [the] walls have holes and pipes are exposed.\" Her kitchen floors are buckling, and Lara can see down to her neighbor's first-floor apartment. \"I feel like the ceiling is going to collapse on us or we are going to fall on my neighbor below us,\" the 44-year-old native of El Salvador says. Ashley worries about being bitten by bedbugs or rodents at night. \"Sometimes my daughter wakes up in the middle of the night when she hears rats and mice roaming around,\" Lara says, fighting back tears. Ashley asks her mom if rodent traps are set up in the apartment. \"She's anxious and stressed and often develops difficulty breathing.\" \n                The bottom of María Lara's oven is broken and full of mice feces.

The complaint alleges violations of the Fair Housing Act, including intentional discrimination based on race and national origin. The company's business strategy, the complaint alleges, involves the \"intentional targeting of these low-income communities of color.\" \"Basic maintenance and necessary repairs to both properties have been ignored and neglected to the point that the exclusively minority families living in them are forced to live in conditions that belie expected housing conditions in the region,\" the complaint states. CASA de Maryland, an immigrant advocacy organization headquartered in Hyattsville, Md., organized the tenants for months and is also a plaintiff in the case. \"The conditions at the BVS [Bedford and Victoria Station] properties, deteriorating in real time around the families living in them, would shock the conscience of most Marylanders and others living only a short distance away,\" according to the complaint. \n                Jesús González says that the landlord recently repainted his bathroom after a drawn-out dispute.\n                \n                    \n                    Ian Morton/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n The Bedford and Victoria Station complex is managed by Ross Companies, a defendant in the class action. According to the company's website, Ross is \"a premier owner, renovator and manager of multifamily assets in the Mid-Atlantic region since 1983.\" NPR reached out to the company's public relations office in Bethesda, Md., and was told that \"the company has seen the complaint, but it's not talking to the media. We speak with our residents.\" NPR reached out to Arbor Realty Trust but got no response to requests for comment. According to the complaint, the company owns \"over 8,000 units and has acquired more than $1.75 billion of multifamily properties across the country.\" Like many immigrants, Lara says crushing poverty pushed her to migrate to the Washington area in 2006. She thought life in the U.S. would be easier, but it has been a struggle. Ashley's father abandoned them when Lara was expecting the baby. Lara works in construction, cleaning and prepping materials — work that isn't always reliable. The coronavirus pandemic severely cut her work hours to less than half. Lara has lived in the Bedford and Victoria Station complex since 2009, and though Lara says management has neglected the units for a long time, she says that the pandemic lockdown seems to have emboldened her landlord. When she has asked for needed repairs in her unit, \"the manager says, why don't you leave if you don't like it here?\" \n                Jesús González, who has lived in Bedford and Victoria Station for 15 years, says he has put much of his time, energy and money into fixing his apartment to keep it clean.\n                \n                    \n                    Ian Morton/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n If she could, Lara would move, \"but I don't have options.

It's not easy for people to get up and move.\" A 2019 study published in the American Journal of Sociology explored the burden of housing costs on low-income renters in urban neighborhoods, landlord exploitation and the high profit margins gained by landlords that own properties in those areas. \n                Top: The front door to María Lara's apartment is broken.

They don't have many options, even if they're living in an apartment that's falling apart around them, like the apartments in Langley Park.\" Arbor Realty Trust Inc. is managed by Arbor Commercial Mortgage LLC, and according to the complaint, Arbor Realty Trust \"exerts controlling authority over the co-defendants and subsidiaries,\" including Bedford United LLC, Victoria United LLC and others. The LLC, or limited liability company, model is used by large companies to organize themselves, says Donahue, but also to wall off their business. \n                Jesús González shows the extension cable he uses to run power from the main outlet of the apartment into his bedroom to power the air conditioning unit. He says when it gets hot outside, most of the outlets in the building stop working because of the power demand.\n                \n                    \n                    Ian Morton/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n \"There is often a lot of secrecy behind who owns them,\" Donahue says. When you rent a house, you have to follow landlord-tenant laws, but an LLC is typically a company behind a company and it can skirt those laws, he argues in an interview with NPR and in the complaint. \"I believe they have created a conflict of interest for themselves,\" Donahue says, describing the allegations in the complaint. Arbor Realty Trust Inc., a publicly traded company, has a duty to ensure profits for its shareholders, he says, but it also has duties to its tenants under the law. \"They need to provide safe homes,\" Donahue says. In describing the complaint, he told NPR, \"Arbor has violated their duties to their tenants. It's profits for nameless shareholders and terrible conditions for folks who live and pay their rent in these properties.\" \n                María Lara shows a loose and broken window in her home.

Residents don't have central air conditioning or heat, and tenants have to set up their own air conditioning units and portable heaters, according to González. González, 65, says he suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol and has breathing difficulties. He often uses supplemental oxygen, he says. He has stayed put for 15 years \"because of the neighborhood. We are all Hispanics here. If you need an onion or salt, I feel comfortable borrowing those from a neighbor. I feel the warmth of El Salvador here.\" González came to the U.S. from the small Central American country more than three decades ago. \"We are tired of being neglected, being ignored,\" he says. He adds that his community was heavily affected by the pandemic, with many losing jobs and unable to pay rent or buy food. \"Hunger and need pushed us to sue the landlord — to say enough. We have never asked for free housing. What we ask for is fair housing conditions.\" The Bedford and Victoria Station complex houses 589 units, built in the 1940s \"and never significantly renovated,\" according to the complaint, which alleges that living conditions for families have worsened because repairs, rodent infestation and toxic mold have been neglected. The complaint asks the court to certify the lawsuit as a class action on behalf of all tenants. Donahue, the attorney, says he hopes the litigation sheds light on the practices of investors that, he says, take advantage of low-income, multifamily residential properties such as the one in Langley Park. \"There's a lot of companies that own properties like this, and they don't fix them and they squeeze the properties for rent,\" he says. \"This needs to stop.\"",

    "title": "Julián Castro wants to transform housing assistance for poor, give renters tax credits",
    "domain": "nbcnews.com",
    "text": "  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro would transform and expand a housing assistance program for the poor and give renters a tax credit in a housing plan he unveiled Monday. “People are experiencing an affordable housing crisis, whether they live in a red or blue community, whether they are white or black. This rental affordability touches the lives of so many,” said Castro, who served as President Barack Obama’s housing secretary, in unveiling the first installment of his three-part housing plan. Just 25 percent of people eligible for the housing subsidies actually get vouchers, Castro said, and he wants to transform the housing assistance program, known as Section 8, into a fully funded entitlement program — a reference to federal safety net programs such as Social Security. In addition, Castro called for a refundable tax credit for low- and middle-income renters if their rent exceeds 30 percent of their income. It would be a progressive tax credit that would give priority to low-income individuals and cover families earning 50 to 100 percent of the area median income. The credit would be paid monthly and participants could direct their credits to a tax-advantaged savings account to use for a down payment on a mortgage. Castro said housing affordability is an issue that affects seniors on a fixed income, young adults trying to save for their first home, renters in gentrifying neighborhoods and mobile home owners who rent the land under their homes. He plans to release plans later on how he'll pay for these and other policy proposals he's announced. Castro also seeks to increase the supply of affordable housing with investments in construction of additional public housing, in upgrades of public housing and through the expansion of the Low Income Housing Tax Credit. “Housing is a human right,” Castro stated in his plan. He set lofty goals for housing should he be elected. He said he would end veteran, child and youth homelessness by the end of his first term and end chronic homelessness by the end of 2028. Castro had planned to release his housing platform Monday at the Poor People’s Campaign presidential forum in Washington, but a canceled flight kept him from getting to the forum in time. The Poor People’s Campaign serves low-income people, and the forum was intended for allow members to hear from Democratic candidates on their plans to combat systemic racism and poverty. “I’m committed to working toward prosperity for every single American no matter their background,” Castro told NBC News on Monday. “The fact is in our nation’s history, poverty and racism have been so intertwined that we need to address both at the same time.” Castro grew up in a poor area of San Antonio, Texas, and is the only Latino candidate in the race. He has yet to break into the upper ranks of the crowded Democratic field but did qualify for the Democratic debates in Miami on June 26 and 27. He'll appear on the first night. The remaining installments of his housing platform were to be released Tuesday and Wednesday. FOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.

This rental affordability touches the lives of so many,” said Castro, who served as President Barack Obama’s housing secretary, in unveiling the first installment of his three-part housing plan. Just 25 percent of people eligible for the housing subsidies actually get vouchers, Castro said, and he wants to transform the housing assistance program, known as Section 8, into a fully funded entitlement program — a reference to federal safety net programs such as Social Security. In addition, Castro called for a refundable tax credit for low- and middle-income renters if their rent exceeds 30 percent of their income. It would be a progressive tax credit that would give priority to low-income individuals and cover families earning 50 to 100 percent of the area median income. The credit would be paid monthly and participants could direct their credits to a tax-advantaged savings account to use for a down payment on a mortgage. Castro said housing affordability is an issue that affects seniors on a fixed income, young adults trying to save for their first home, renters in gentrifying neighborhoods and mobile home owners who rent the land under their homes. He plans to release plans later on how he'll pay for these and other policy proposals he's announced. Castro also seeks to increase the supply of affordable housing with investments in construction of additional public housing, in upgrades of public housing and through the expansion of the Low Income Housing Tax Credit. “Housing is a human right,” Castro stated in his plan. He set lofty goals for housing should he be elected. He said he would end veteran, child and youth homelessness by the end of his first term and end chronic homelessness by the end of 2028. Castro had planned to release his housing platform Monday at the Poor People’s Campaign presidential forum in Washington, but a canceled flight kept him from getting to the forum in time. The Poor People’s Campaign serves low-income people, and the forum was intended for allow members to hear from Democratic candidates on their plans to combat systemic racism and poverty. “I’m committed to working toward prosperity for every single American no matter their background,” Castro told NBC News on Monday. “The fact is in our nation’s history, poverty and racism have been so intertwined that we need to address both at the same time.” The remaining installments of his housing platform were to be released Tuesday and Wednesday.",

Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published. The complaints started as soon as Louisiana launched its massive program to help homeowners rebuild after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Community leaders said the largest rebuilding program in U.S. history would be unfair to the state’s poorest residents. Activists and real estate experts spoke out at meetings of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which designed and ran the Road Home program. An attorney representing poor homeowners testified before Congress. A fair housing group sued the state and federal governments. State officials made tweaks and settled the lawsuit, but they never changed a core part of the formula that determined how much homeowners received. Now a groundbreaking analysis of nearly 92,000 rebuilding grants statewide shows critics were right all along: Road Home shortchanged people in poor neighborhoods while giving those in wealthy neighborhoods more of what they needed. People in the most impoverished areas in New Orleans — those with a median income of $15,000 or less — had to cover 30% of their rebuilding costs after Road Home grants, Federal Emergency Management Agency aid and insurance. In areas where the median income was more than $75,000, the shortfall was 20%, according to the analysis by ProPublica, The Times-Picayune | The Advocate and WWL-TV. Median household income Damage left uncovered for all properties in each income group 30% <$15K $15-30K 27% 25% $30-45K $45-60K 23% 23% $60-75K >$75K 20% Poverty tracks closely with race in New Orleans, so the shortfalls in the city disproportionately hurt Black people. Road Home also underpaid residents of St. Bernard Parish, a mostly white, working-class community devastated by the hurricane. Had properties in the lowest-income parts of New Orleans been covered at the same rate as the wealthiest, each of those households would have received about $18,000 more on average. Across the city, covering all homeowners’ repair costs at the rate of the highest earners would have resulted in another $349 million for rebuilding. The Road Home program was hugely consequential for Louisiana, and much more so for its largest city, most of which flooded after Katrina’s storm surge overwhelmed its levees. Most homeowners didn’t have adequate insurance. Facing the possibility of a mass exodus, state leaders devised Road Home to cover the gap and encourage people to rebuild. Road Home also allowed homeowners to sell their property to the state and move elsewhere, though housing was scarce in the region. If homeowners didn’t stay in Louisiana, they forfeited 40% of their home’s value. New Orleans was the biggest beneficiary of rebuilding grants, and half of all owner-occupied homes in New Orleans received rebuilding grants, with $3.3 billion awarded citywide. Some neighborhoods rebounded quickly. Others languished. Housing advocates say that’s due to the original sin of the Road Home program: It calculated each grant based on a home’s value before the hurricane or on the cost of repairs — whichever was less. The value of most homes in poor areas was lower than the cost of rebuilding them, so the resulting grants didn’t cover all repairs. But for most people in affluent areas, the rebuilding cost was lower than the value of their homes. They got grants that came closer to covering their needs. “The practical effects of how this program shaped the city can still be seen today,” said Davida Finger, an attorney who testified to Congress in 2009 about unfairness in the Road Home program. Poor New Orleanians had a much harder time covering the costs. For a homeowner in the lowest-income areas, it would have taken more than 43 months at the average annual salary to pay the cost of repairs not covered by Road Home, FEMA and insurance, the news outlets found. In the highest-income areas, it would have taken less than eight months. The shortcomings in the Road Home program are part of a broader tapestry of failures in the ways America helps people affected by catastrophes. A yearlong investigation by ProPublica, The Times-Picayune | The Advocate and WWL-TV has found that disaster programs often shortchange the people who need it most, worsening inequities in the wake of disaster. Finger said the news organizations’ findings were “shocking but not surprising.” “What Black homeowners, what lawyers, what advocates, what community organizers, what reporters were telling the program designers all along was completely accurate,” Finger said. “They simply didn’t want to hear it.” The state Office of Community Development took issue with the analysis, but none of the points it raised affected the news organizations’ findings. Two officials who were in charge of the recovery told the news outlets that the findings were troubling. Andy Kopplin, the first executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, stressed that state officials took pains to steer more money to poorer homeowners through a second grant program. But Kopplin acknowledged in a written statement that the findings show that low- and middle-income households should’ve received more. That’s “upsetting to those of us who were working to create more equitable outcomes and especially to those families who needed and deserved more resources for their recovery,” he wrote. Walter Leger, who was a key board member of the LRA, said the findings should spur the state to seek more federal aid from Congress to fill the gaps. De’Marcus Finnell, deputy press secretary for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, declined to address the findings directly. But in a statement he said HUD’s experience after Katrina led it to favor programs that guide homeowners through rebuilding rather than giving homeowners money “and letting them manage the recovery process on their own.” In fact, federal rules no longer allow homeowners to be compensated for losses after a disaster, and Leger said using property values to determine aid after Katrina now appears to have been a misstep. “The plan was to help the homeowner repair his home or her home and get back in the home,” Leger said. The news organizations’ analysis shows there were disparities, he said, and “that’s something that should have been, and maybe should be, addressed.” Before Katrina, the neighborhoods of Lakeview and Gentilly Woods had a lot in common. Both sat below sea level on reclaimed swampland near Lake Pontchartrain. They boasted similar post-World War II housing stock. Lakeview was almost entirely white, and Gentilly Woods was more than two-thirds Black. Lakeview residents had higher incomes, and their homes commanded higher prices. Both neighborhoods were swamped when the floodwalls along New Orleans’ drainage canals buckled after Katrina. Water reached the eaves of many homes. Road Home appraised the average Lakeview home at $326,000 and the average repair cost at $286,000. With a grant based on the repair cost, the average homeowner received 83% of what was needed to rebuild, according to the news organizations’ analysis. In Gentilly Woods, the average property was valued at $121,000, with $203,000 in rebuilding costs. With a grant based on the home’s value, the average homeowner ended up with just 73% of what was needed to rebuild. Among those served well by Road Home was Lakeview retiree Rita Legrand, 86. She had to gut her modest ranch home. But she was determined to rebuild. With $53,000 from insurance in hand, Legrand applied for a Road Home grant in fall 2006. Road Home estimated her home’s value at $320,000 and her repair costs at $188,000. Her grant, based on repair costs minus what she’d already gotten from insurance, was $135,000. The grant and insurance proceeds covered her entire loss, as it was supposed to, and by April 2007 she had completely rebuilt. “The program worked great for me,” she said. The experience was quite different for Cynthia and Charles Heisser of Gentilly Woods. Like Legrand, the Heissers had a small ranch house, and they had a similar repair estimate: $190,000. But their initial grant was just $32,000. Charles Heisser, a 90-year-old Korean War veteran, still has the documents explaining how Road Home arrived at that figure. Program officials estimated the pre-storm value of their home at $83,000. The state subtracted $40,000 in insurance proceeds, which their lender had made them use to pay off their mortgage, and $10,500 in FEMA aid they had received for living expenses. Charles Heisser appealed, arguing Road Home had failed to factor in tens of thousands of dollars in improvements they had made before the storm. Their home was reappraised for $135,000. That increased their grant to about $83,500. Even then, their total compensation including insurance and FEMA grants was $135,000 — just 70% of Road Home’s original estimate of what it would take to make their home livable. The Heissers spent some of the Road Home grant to convert their garage into living quarters so they could move out of the FEMA trailer in their front yard. For most of the next 10 years, the house sat with a new roof and an unfinished interior where they hung laundry. Cynthia Heisser couldn’t help but notice how differently things went in mostly white parts of New Orleans. “It was unjust, more unjust to the Blacks than it was to the whites,” she said. People used to ask her, she recalled, “‘Oh, you don’t have your house yet?’ Or ‘You’re not in your home yet?’ And we’d say, ‘It isn’t because we’re not fighting for it. We are.’” A nonprofit called Rebuilding Together New Orleans eventually provided labor and materials to help finish repairs. The Heissers finally moved back into their house in 2018 — 13 years after the storm. From the beginning, Road Home had a problem. On the one hand, thousands of residents desperately needed rebuilding aid. On the other, Road Home, like many disaster aid programs, had guardrails to make sure people didn’t end up better off than before the storm. The idea was that “it would be illegitimate for somebody whose house only had a market value of $100,000 to get $120,000, even if that was how much it would cost to repair,” said Andy Horowitz, a history professor at the University of Connecticut and author of “Katrina: A History, 1915-2015.” When people complained that using home values to calculate grants would help some people more than others, officials argued that pre-storm value had been part of the formula from the start. Besides, Leger said at the time, it was required by the federal government, and there wasn’t enough time or money to change the rules. In a June 2006 interview shortly after the program was approved, Louisiana Recovery Authority chair Norman Francis dismissed the very problem many poor homeowners would soon face — that the cost of rebuilding could far exceed the value of their homes. “That money is going to cover the difference between your damages and how much insurance you got,” Francis said. “Now, if you had a $50,000 home, not likely that you had $200,000 worth of damage. So the formula has to take into consideration your home value.” A family member said Francis, now 91, was unavailable to comment for this story. Melanie Ehrlich, who lived in Baltimore while her Gentilly home was rebuilt, said she quickly saw the problem with the formula. She founded a grassroots organization, the Citizens’ Road Home Action Team, and became a thorn in the side of Road Home officials. “It was crystal clear how very unfair the program was in its design,” said Ehrlich, a Tulane University genetics professor. “What I saw is that the victims of Hurricane Katrina were being victimized again.” In October 2006, shortly after Road Home was launched, Ehrlich met with officials in charge of the recovery and argued their formula for calculating grants was unfair. She followed up with examples. Basing grants on the pre-storm value of homes, she wrote, would “justifiably anger the middle and lower economic classes, or, more specifically, everyone who does not have an expensive house or lot.” As homeowners received their grant letters over the course of 2007, hundreds showed up at Finger’s low-income law clinic at Loyola University. She attended dozens of public meetings in Baton Rouge, New Orleans and Washington to ask officials to fix the inequity baked into the calculations. In August 2009, Finger told a congressional committee that the formula disproportionately hurt Black residents because their homes tended to be valued for less. “Road Home’s grant formula design assured that some homeowners would not receive sufficient rebuilding funds,” she said. Six state officials involved with the recovery effort said they didn’t ignore these complaints. But they noted that they were building a program of unprecedented scope and dealing with unforeseen problems, all while under intense pressure to get money to homeowners quickly. Leger said he took Ehrlich’s complaint about pre-storm value to HUD officials and asked to use higher repair estimates instead. “We were told no,” he said. Soon after the program launched, state officials said, they made changes that increased grants for all applicants: factoring land value into appraisals, using the highest of several appraisal methods and increasing rates for repair estimates. They originally envisioned an affordable loan program to fill any gaps between grants and the actual costs of rebuilding, but it never got off the ground. In 2007, they created another grant for less affluent homeowners whose initial grants didn’t meet their damage estimates. That enabled the state to meet a HUD requirement to pay at least half of grant money to low- and moderate-income households. Three years later, after Black homeowners sued the head of the LRA and HUD alleging the program was discriminatory, Francis said, “That did not pass on my radar screen. If it had, I would have questioned why the program wasn’t treating people equitably.” Francis was a revered civil rights leader and longtime president of Xavier University, a historically Black school, and Finger said she does not believe he and the other architects of Road Home intended it to be discriminatory. Nonetheless, Finger said, “It is very difficult to look at a system that’s trying to roll out that much money as quickly as possible and to not do it in a way that replicates historic, systemic inequities.” The plaintiffs in the suit included Almarie Ford, who said the hurricane shutters that adorn her New Orleans East home are all she ever got from Road Home. A month after Katrina, Ford returned to find her Kingswood subdivision in ruins. The now-73-year-old social worker recalled walking into her house and gagging on the smell of black mold. She turned around, locked the front door and left, unsure what to do next. Like many homeowners, she expected significant government assistance, but it never came. Road Home officials assessed her damage at about $297,000 but based her grant on her home’s value, $150,000. They gave her just $3,468 after subtracting about $146,500 in insurance payments. If the grant had been based on rebuilding costs, she would have received the maximum Road Home grant of $150,000. Instead, Ford took out a loan and exhausted her savings. “I was shocked,” Ford said of the size of her grant. “But what could you do? You could complain that you only got $3,500. But they said, ‘Well, those are the rules.’” She wasn’t willing to accept what she described as an injustice without a fight. So she went to the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center. In 2008, the housing center had joined with PolicyLink, a California nonprofit, to collect examples that showed Road Home’s formula disproportionately hurt poor communities and people of color. Ironically, PolicyLink had teamed with the LRA two years earlier to present the state’s initial recovery plan. In a sign of just how unexpected the inequities were, a PolicyLink representative spoke at an LRA board meeting in April 2006 and “applauded the board for the design of the housing action plan,” according to meeting minutes. James Perry, the head of the housing center, said his organization examined two nearly identical homes: four bedrooms, two bathrooms, brick construction. Each had flooded with 6 feet of water and had damages estimated at more than $200,000. But one house was in a white neighborhood and the other in a Black neighborhood. Each homeowner received a grant based on their home value. Perry said the white homeowner got $150,000; the Black homeowner, $90,000. Perry said his organization gave that information to Road Home and HUD, but neither took immediate action. Perry said he was shocked by what he perceived to be their lack of interest. “It wasn’t easy to remedy, but it seemed to me they would want to.” In the resulting lawsuit, attorneys cited 2000 census data to prove their case: About 93% of Black-owned homes in New Orleans were valued at less than $150,000, compared to 55% of white-owned homes. The homeowners secured an important victory before a federal district judge in 2010. The next year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned that ruling and sent the case back to district court, rejecting claims the grant formula was discriminatory. The appeals court ruled that any gap in grants for Black families had been eliminated when, after the lawsuit had been filed, the state removed a $50,000 cap on the additional grant for low-income homeowners. But the news outlets’ analysis shows the appeals court’s assessment was wrong. The additional grants did help homeowners in lower-income, nonwhite areas in New Orleans, most of which are majority Black. Thanks in part to the program, the average grant to a Black homeowner in Louisiana was slightly larger than the average grant overall, according to state records. But in the end, the additional grants merely boosted the average share of damage covered by grants and insurance from about 51% to about 70% in those parts of New Orleans. That meant poor, nonwhite areas ultimately fared about the same as middle-income nonwhite areas, but not as well as even the poorest white ones. The analysis backs up what U.S. District Court Judge Henry Kennedy wrote in 2010 in a preliminary ruling: “The Court does not take lightly that some African American homeowners received lower awards than they would have if their homes were in predominantly white neighborhoods.” Louisiana and HUD “offered no legitimate reason for taking pre-storm home values into account” when calculating grants, he wrote. While the appeals court accused plaintiffs of cherry-picking their data by focusing on majority-Black New Orleans, the news outlets’ analysis shows the disparity between wealthy and poor neighborhoods statewide was similar to that in New Orleans. Three months after the appeals court ruling, Louisiana and HUD settled the lawsuit. The state agreed to put $62 million aside for yet another program, this one for people who made too much money to qualify for additional grants but needed more help. It was a drop in the bucket. According to a state analysis in 2010, 25,000 New Orleans homeowners received a total of $1.2 billion less from the Road Home because their grants were calculated using pre-storm value rather than the cost of damage. Despite being a plaintiff in the suit, Ford said she didn’t receive anything from the settlement. Fewer than 500 people did. It took more than three years for her to complete repairs. During that time, she rented an apartment in Baton Rouge and continued to pay her mortgage, a strain that she said nearly broke her. “It didn’t work for the people it was supposed to work for,” Ford said of the recovery program. “None of the people that I know in New Orleans East actually got any Road Home money. A lot of people, especially people who are more elderly, they just didn’t come back.” One morning in September, Lynette Boutte picked up a piece of artwork in her Seventh Ward beauty salon. In the middle was a photo illustration of hundreds of Black people near the intersection of North Claiborne and Orleans avenues. It depicted Super Sunday in 2003, two years before the storm. Boutte gazed wistfully, as if she could still hear the calls of the Mardi Gras Indians that day. Since Katrina, there hasn’t been such a raucous Super Sunday celebration in her neighborhood. Music was once the lifeblood of the Seventh Ward, a working-class Creole neighborhood near the French Quarter. It has produced musical greats such as Jelly Roll Morton and John Boutte, one of her nine siblings. After school, the sound of children playing trumpets would echo through the streets. In the evenings, musicians would fill her house for jam sessions. The Seventh Ward doesn’t sing like it used to, she said. “There are no children in this neighborhood anymore.” Boutte didn’t receive a dime from Road Home to rebuild, she said, because the state lowballed her property value and repair costs. It took her nearly a decade, but she managed to rebuild with the help of relatives and church volunteers. Many weren’t so lucky. Families who had lived in the neighborhood for generations were unable to return because they couldn’t afford to fix their homes. In the two decades after 2000, the number of children in the Seventh Ward dropped by more than a third, according to the Data Center, a community research nonprofit. The Black population in the Seventh Ward decreased by about 19 percentage points. When asked how much responsibility the Road Home program shares for these changes, Boutte didn’t hesitate. “They are responsible for it all,” she said. William Stoudt, executive director of Rebuilding Together New Orleans, which focuses on the Seventh Ward, said over the past 15 years his staffers have witnessed many people living in “completely substandard conditions.” Road Home’s grant formula is partly to blame, he said. Residents who got shortchanged had to cut corners, often hiring subpar contractors and using cheaper materials, he said. Some abandoned their properties because they couldn’t afford to rebuild; others sold them to predatory developers at below-market prices. “Most of the homeowners that we help work their entire lives for 11 bucks an hour at a hotel in the Quarter cleaning rooms day after day and have no savings,” he said. “They never had a chance.” The community is now pockmarked with empty lots and abandoned homes. Nearly 1 in 4 Seventh Ward houses were vacant in 2020, a 51% increase compared to two decades prior, according to the Data Center. In Lakeview, where Stoudt grew up, the post-Katrina recovery looks dramatically different. Stoudt remembers standing in his street three weeks after the storm amid uprooted trees and abandoned cars covered in dried mud. The waterlogged front door of his family home had swollen shut. To get inside, his parents climbed a ladder and went in through a second-story window. It was the silence, though, that haunted him. Stoudt said it seemed as if everything had died. “It was the quietest place you’ve ever been in your life.” That silence was soon replaced by the sound of hammers and saws. His parents’ flood insurance policy covered the cost of repairs, so they didn’t need a Road Home grant. Construction began almost immediately. Within a year, their home had been rebuilt. Today, he said, Lakeview is largely unrecognizable. People didn’t just rebuild, they expanded — replacing their ranch houses with multistory, modern homes. “Now it’s McMansions, 4,000 square feet, double-lot monsters,” Stoudt said. “If you were in the right neighborhood, you got what you needed to rebuild.” To evaluate the impacts of the Road Home program, The Times-Picayune, ProPublica and WWL-TV obtained a novel dataset of more than 130,000 grants from the Louisiana Division of Administration. The anonymized dataset included, for each grant recipient in the state, the grant amounts, the pre-storm value of the property and any insurance and FEMA payouts. The analysis was conducted on a subset of 91,771 rebuilding grants that had valid grant and damage amounts, were not part of a lawsuit over errors in grant calculations and did not fall under a limited number of other circumstances that could yield incorrect information. Our analysis focused on 30,188 records from Orleans Parish and 5,911 from St. Bernard Parish. For our analysis of demographics and income, we used data from Summary File 3 in the 2000 U.S. Census, downloaded from IPUMS NHGIS, University of Minnesota. This dataset contains survey responses from the longform census questionnaire, which was sent to approximately one in six households, and is available on the block group level. In the city of New Orleans, additional analysis using 2000 census data was conducted using Neighborhood Statistical Areas provided by the New Orleans Data Center, a nonprofit research center that defines those boundaries. Any use of “neighborhoods” refers to these boundaries. The word “areas” refers to census block groups. \n\tSophie Chou is a data reporter at ProPublica.

A yearlong investigation by ProPublica, The Times-Picayune | The Advocate and WWL-TV has found that disaster programs often shortchange the people who need it most, worsening inequities in the wake of disaster.\n\nFinger said the news organizations’ findings were “shocking but not surprising.” “What Black homeowners, what lawyers, what advocates, what community organizers, what reporters were telling the program designers all along was completely accurate,” Finger said. “They simply didn’t want to hear it.”\n\nThe state Office of Community Development took issue with the analysis, but none of the points it raised affected the news organizations’ findings. Two officials who were in charge of the recovery told the news outlets that the findings were troubling.\n\nAndy Kopplin, the first executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, stressed that state officials took pains to steer more money to poorer homeowners through a second grant program. But Kopplin acknowledged in a written statement that the findings show that low- and middle-income households should’ve received more. That’s “upsetting to those of us who were working to create more equitable outcomes and especially to those families who needed and deserved more resources for their recovery,” he wrote.\n\nWalter Leger, who was a key board member of the LRA, said the findings should spur the state to seek more federal aid from Congress to fill the gaps. De’Marcus Finnell, deputy press secretary for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, declined to address the findings directly. But in a statement he said HUD’s experience after Katrina led it to favor programs that guide homeowners through rebuilding rather than giving homeowners money “and letting them manage the recovery process on their own.”\n\nIn fact, federal rules no longer allow homeowners to be compensated for losses after a disaster, and Leger said using property values to determine aid after Katrina now appears to have been a misstep. “The plan was to help the homeowner repair his home or her home and get back in the home,” Leger said. The news organizations’ analysis shows there were disparities, he said, and “that’s something that should have been, and maybe should be, addressed.”\n\nBefore Katrina, the neighborhoods of Lakeview and Gentilly Woods had a lot in common. Both sat below sea level on reclaimed swampland near Lake Pontchartrain. They boasted similar post-World War II housing stock. Lakeview was almost entirely white, and Gentilly Woods was more than two-thirds Black. Lakeview residents had higher incomes, and their homes commanded higher prices. Both neighborhoods were swamped when the floodwalls along New Orleans’ drainage canals buckled after Katrina. Water reached the eaves of many homes.\n\nRoad Home appraised the average Lakeview home at $326,000 and the average repair cost at $286,000. With a grant based on the repair cost, the average homeowner received 83% of what was needed to rebuild, according to the news organizations’ analysis. In Gentilly Woods, the average property was valued at $121,000, with $203,000 in rebuilding costs. With a grant based on the home’s value, the average homeowner ended up with just 73% of what was needed to rebuild.\n\nAmong those served well by Road Home was Lakeview retiree Rita Legrand, 86. She had to gut her modest ranch home. But she was determined to rebuild. With $53,000 from insurance in hand, Legrand applied for a Road Home grant in fall 2006. Road Home estimated her home’s value at $320,000 and her repair costs at $188,000. Her grant, based on repair costs minus what she’d already gotten from insurance, was $135,000. The grant and insurance proceeds covered her entire loss, as it was supposed to, and by April 2007 she had completely rebuilt.\n\n“The program worked great for me,” she said.\n\nThe experience was quite different for Cynthia and Charles Heisser of Gentilly Woods. Like Legrand, the Heissers had a small ranch house, and they had a similar repair estimate: $190,000. But their initial grant was just $32,000. Charles Heisser, a 90-year-old Korean War veteran, still has the documents explaining how Road Home arrived at that figure. Program officials estimated the pre-storm value of their home at $83,000. The state subtracted $40,000 in insurance proceeds, which their lender had made them use to pay off their mortgage, and $10,500 in FEMA aid they had received for living expenses.\n\nCharles Heisser appealed, arguing Road Home had failed to factor in tens of thousands of dollars in improvements they had made before the storm. Their home was reappraised for $135,000. That increased their grant to about $83,500. Even then, their total compensation including insurance and FEMA grants was $135,000 — just 70% of Road Home’s original estimate of what it would take to make their home livable.\n\nThe Heissers spent some of the Road Home grant to convert their garage into living quarters so they could move out of the FEMA trailer in their front yard. For most of the next 10 years, the house sat with a new roof and an unfinished interior where they hung laundry. Cynthia Heisser couldn’t help but notice how differently things went in mostly white parts of New Orleans.\n\n“It was unjust, more unjust to the Blacks than it was to the whites,” she said. People used to ask her, she recalled, “‘Oh, you don’t have your house yet?’ Or ‘You’re not in your home yet?’ And we’d say, ‘It isn’t because we’re not fighting for it. We are.’”\n\nA nonprofit called Rebuilding Together New Orleans eventually provided labor and materials to help finish repairs. The Heissers finally moved back into their house in 2018 — 13 years after the storm.\n\nFrom the beginning, Road Home had a problem. On the one hand, thousands of residents desperately needed rebuilding aid. On the other, Road Home, like many disaster aid programs, had guardrails to make sure people didn’t end up better off than before the storm.\n\nThe idea was that “it would be illegitimate for somebody whose house only had a market value of $100,000 to get $120,000, even if that was how much it would cost to repair,” said Andy Horowitz, a history professor at the University of Connecticut and author of “Katrina: A History, 1915-2015.”\n\nWhen people complained that using home values to calculate grants would help some people more than others, officials argued that pre-storm value had been part of the formula from the start. Besides, Leger said at the time, it was required by the federal government, and there wasn’t enough time or money to change the rules.\n\nIn a June 2006 interview shortly after the program was approved, Louisiana Recovery Authority chair Norman Francis dismissed the very problem many poor homeowners would soon face — that the cost of rebuilding could far exceed the value of their homes.\n\n“That money is going to cover the difference between your damages and how much insurance you got,” Francis said. “Now, if you had a $50,000 home, not likely that you had $200,000 worth of damage. So the formula has to take into consideration your home value.”\n\nA family member said Francis, now 91, was unavailable to comment for this story.\n\nMelanie Ehrlich, who lived in Baltimore while her Gentilly home was rebuilt, said she quickly saw the problem with the formula. She founded a grassroots organization, the Citizens’ Road Home Action Team, and became a thorn in the side of Road Home officials.\n\n“It was crystal clear how very unfair the program was in its design,” said Ehrlich, a Tulane University genetics professor. “What I saw is that the victims of Hurricane Katrina were being victimized again.”\n\nIn October 2006, shortly after Road Home was launched, Ehrlich met with officials in charge of the recovery and argued their formula for calculating grants was unfair. She followed up with examples. Basing grants on the pre-storm value of homes, she wrote, would “justifiably anger the middle and lower economic classes, or, more specifically, everyone who does not have an expensive house or lot.”\n\nAs homeowners received their grant letters over the course of 2007, hundreds showed up at Finger’s low-income law clinic at Loyola University. She attended dozens of public meetings in Baton Rouge, New Orleans and Washington to ask officials to fix the inequity baked into the calculations.\n\nIn August 2009, Finger told a congressional committee that the formula disproportionately hurt Black residents because their homes tended to be valued for less.\n\n“Road Home’s grant formula design assured that some homeowners would not receive sufficient rebuilding funds,” she said.\n\nSix state officials involved with the recovery effort said they didn’t ignore these complaints. But they noted that they were building a program of unprecedented scope and dealing with unforeseen problems, all while under intense pressure to get money to homeowners quickly.\n\nLeger said he took Ehrlich’s complaint about pre-storm value to HUD officials and asked to use higher repair estimates instead.\n\n“We were told no,” he said.\n\nSoon after the program launched, state officials said, they made changes that increased grants for all applicants: factoring land value into appraisals, using the highest of several appraisal methods and increasing rates for repair estimates.\n\nThey originally envisioned an affordable loan program to fill any gaps between grants and the actual costs of rebuilding, but it never got off the ground. In 2007, they created another grant for less affluent homeowners whose initial grants didn’t meet their damage estimates.\n\nThat enabled the state to meet a HUD requirement to pay at least half of grant money to low- and moderate-income households.\n\nThree years later, after Black homeowners sued the head of the LRA and HUD alleging the program was discriminatory, Francis said, “That did not pass on my radar screen. If it had, I would have questioned why the program wasn’t treating people equitably.”\n\nFrancis was a revered civil rights leader and longtime president of Xavier University, a historically Black school, and Finger said she does not believe he and the other architects of Road Home intended it to be discriminatory.\n\nNonetheless, Finger said, “It is very difficult to look at a system that’s trying to roll out that much money as quickly as possible and to not do it in a way that replicates historic, systemic inequities.”\n\nThe plaintiffs in the suit included Almarie Ford, who said the hurricane shutters that adorn her New Orleans East home are all she ever got from Road Home.\n\nA month after Katrina, Ford returned to find her Kingswood subdivision in ruins. The now-73-year-old social worker recalled walking into her house and gagging on the smell of black mold. She turned around, locked the front door and left, unsure what to do next.\n\nLike many homeowners, she expected significant government assistance, but it never came.\n\nRoad Home officials assessed her damage at about $297,000 but based her grant on her home’s value, $150,000. They gave her just $3,468 after subtracting about $146,500 in insurance payments.\n\nIf the grant had been based on rebuilding costs, she would have received the maximum Road Home grant of $150,000. Instead, Ford took out a loan and exhausted her savings.\n\n“I was shocked,” Ford said of the size of her grant. “But what could you do? You could complain that you only got $3,500. But they said, ‘Well, those are the rules.’”\n\nShe wasn’t willing to accept what she described as an injustice without a fight. So she went to the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center.\n\nIn 2008, the housing center had joined with PolicyLink, a California nonprofit, to collect examples that showed Road Home’s formula disproportionately hurt poor communities and people of color.\n\nIronically, PolicyLink had teamed with the LRA two years earlier to present the state’s initial recovery plan.\n\nIn a sign of just how unexpected the inequities were, a PolicyLink representative spoke at an LRA board meeting in April 2006 and “applauded the board for the design of the housing action plan,” according to meeting minutes.\n\nJames Perry, the head of the housing center, said his organization examined two nearly identical homes: four bedrooms, two bathrooms, brick construction. Each had flooded with 6 feet of water and had damages estimated at more than $200,000.\n\nBut one house was in a white neighborhood and the other in a Black neighborhood. Perry said the white homeowner got $150,000; the Black homeowner, $90,000.\n\nPerry said his organization gave that information to Road Home and HUD, but neither took immediate action.\n\nPerry said he was shocked by what he perceived to be their lack of interest.\n\n“It wasn’t easy to remedy, but it seemed to me they would want to.”\n\nIn the resulting lawsuit, attorneys cited 2000 census data to prove their case: About 93% of Black-owned homes in New Orleans were valued at less than $150,000, compared to 55% of white-owned homes.\n\nThe homeowners secured an important victory before a federal district judge in 2010.\n\nThe next year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned that ruling and sent the case back to district court, rejecting claims the grant formula was discriminatory.\n\nThe appeals court ruled that any gap in grants for Black families had been eliminated when, after the lawsuit had been filed, the state removed a $50,000 cap on the additional grant for low-income homeowners.\n\nBut the news outlets’ analysis shows the appeals court’s assessment was wrong.\n\nThe additional grants did help homeowners in lower-income, nonwhite areas in New Orleans, most of which are majority Black.\n\nThanks in part to the program, the average grant to a Black homeowner in Louisiana was slightly larger than the average grant overall, according to state records.\n\nBut in the end, the additional grants merely boosted the average share of damage covered by grants and insurance from about 51% to about 70% in those parts of New Orleans.\n\nThat meant poor, nonwhite areas ultimately fared about the same as middle-income nonwhite areas, but not as well as even the poorest white ones.\n\nThe analysis backs up what U.S. District Court Judge Henry Kennedy wrote in 2010 in a preliminary ruling: “The Court does not take lightly that some African American homeowners received lower awards than they would have if their homes were in predominantly white neighborhoods.”\n\nLouisiana and HUD “offered no legitimate reason for taking pre-storm home values into account” when calculating grants, he wrote.\n\nWhile the appeals court accused plaintiffs of cherry-picking their data by focusing on majority-Black New Orleans, the news outlets’ analysis shows the disparity between wealthy and poor neighborhoods statewide was similar to that in New Orleans.\n\nThree months after the appeals court ruling, Louisiana and HUD settled the lawsuit.\n\nThe state agreed to put $62 million aside for yet another program, this one for people who made too much money to qualify for additional grants but needed more help.\n\nIt was a drop in the bucket.\n\nAccording to a state analysis in 2010, 25,000 New Orleans homeowners received a total of $1.2 billion less from the Road Home because their grants were calculated using pre-storm value rather than the cost of damage.\n\nDespite being a plaintiff in the suit, Ford said she didn’t receive anything from the settlement.\n\nFewer than 500 people did.\n\nIt took more than three years for her to complete repairs.\n\nDuring that time, she rented an apartment in Baton Rouge and continued to pay her mortgage, a strain that she said nearly broke her.\n\n“It didn’t work for the people it was supposed to work for,” Ford said of the recovery program.\n\n“None of the people that I know in New Orleans East actually got any Road Home money. A lot of people, especially people who are more elderly, they just didn’t come back.”\n\nOne morning in September, Lynette Boutte picked up a piece of artwork in her Seventh Ward beauty salon.\n\nIn the middle was a photo illustration of hundreds of Black people near the intersection of North Claiborne and Orleans avenues.\n\nIt depicted Super Sunday in 2003, two years before the storm.\n\nBoutte gazed wistfully, as if she could still hear the calls of the Mardi Gras Indians that day.\n\nSince Katrina, there hasn’t been such a raucous Super Sunday celebration in her neighborhood.\n\nMusic was once the lifeblood of the Seventh Ward, a working-class Creole neighborhood near the French Quarter.\n\nIt has produced musical greats such as Jelly Roll Morton and John Boutte, one of her nine siblings.\n\nAfter school, the sound of children playing trumpets would echo through the streets.\n\nIn the evenings, musicians would fill her house for jam sessions.\n\nThe Seventh Ward doesn’t sing like it used to, she said.\n\n“There are no children in this neighborhood anymore.”\n\nBoutte didn’t receive a dime from Road Home to rebuild, she said, because the state lowballed her property value and repair costs.\n\nIt took her nearly a decade, but she managed to rebuild with the help of relatives and church volunteers.\n\nMany weren’t so lucky.\n\nFamilies who had lived in the neighborhood for generations were unable to return because they couldn’t afford to fix their homes.\n\nIn the two decades after 2000, the number of children in the Seventh Ward dropped by more than a third, according to the Data Center, a community research nonprofit.\n\nThe Black population in the Seventh Ward decreased by about 19 percentage points.\n\nWhen asked how much responsibility the Road Home program shares for these changes, Boutte didn’t hesitate.\n\n“They are responsible for it all,” she said.\n\nWilliam Stoudt, executive director of Rebuilding Together New Orleans, which focuses on the Seventh Ward, said over the past 15 years his staffers have witnessed many people living in “completely substandard conditions.”\n\nRoad Home’s grant formula is partly to blame, he said.\n\nResidents who got shortchanged had to cut corners, often hiring subpar contractors and using cheaper materials, he said.\n\nSome abandoned their properties because they couldn’t afford to rebuild; others sold them to predatory developers at below-market prices.\n\n“Most of the homeowners that we help work their entire lives for 11 bucks an hour at a hotel in the Quarter cleaning rooms day after day and have no savings,” he said.\n\n“They never had a chance.”\n\nThe community is now pockmarked with empty lots and abandoned homes.\n\nNearly 1 in 4 Seventh Ward houses were vacant in 2020, a 51% increase compared to two decades prior.\n\nIn Lakeview, where Stoudt grew up, the post-Katrina recovery looks dramatically different.\n\nStoudt remembers standing in his street three weeks after the storm amid uprooted trees and abandoned cars covered in dried mud.\n\nThe waterlogged front door of his family home had swollen shut.\n\nTo get inside, his parents climbed a ladder and went in through a second-story window.\n\nIt was the silence, though, that haunted him.\n\nStoudt said it seemed as if everything had died.\n\n“It was the quietest place you’ve ever been in your life.”\n\nThat silence was soon replaced by the sound of hammers and saws.\n\nHis parents’ flood insurance policy covered the cost of repairs, so they didn’t need a Road Home grant.\n\nConstruction began almost immediately.\n\nWithin a year, their home had been rebuilt.\n\nToday, he said, Lakeview is largely unrecognizable.\n\nPeople didn’t just rebuild, they expanded — replacing their ranch houses with multistory, modern homes.\n\n“Now it’s McMansions, 4,000 square feet, double-lot monsters,” Stoudt said.\n\n“If you were in the right neighborhood, you got what you needed to rebuild.”",

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)                                   \n SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Homeless people in California are already a vulnerable group, often struggling with poor health, trauma and deep poverty before they lose their housing, according to a new study on adult homelessness. The study released Tuesday by the University of California, San Francisco attempts to capture a comprehensive picture of how people become homeless in California, and what impeded their efforts at finding permanent housing. The representative survey of nearly 3,200 homeless people found that when they lost housing, their median household income was $960 a month, and for renters on leases it was $1,400 a month, of which on average half went to rent.  “People are homeless because their rent is too high. And their options are too few. And they have no cushion,” said Dr. Margot Kushel, lead investigator and director of UCSF’s Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative. “And it really makes you wonder how different things would look if we could solve that underlying problem.” Homelessness is a national crisis, and all too pervasive in California, where an estimated 171,000 people — or 30% of all homeless people in the U.S. — are homeless. Political leaders are divided over how to address the crisis, with some, including Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, favoring tent encampment sweeps and a tough-love approach toward those with mental health and addiction issues. It it not groundbreaking news that the state’s exorbitant housing costs are a major driver behind homelessness, but researchers hope their study will strengthen public support for policies that focus on offering housing and emergency rental assistance — rather than policies emphasizing punishment or stigma. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. \n Voters could soon get a chance to weigh in on the state’s latest approach to addressing homelessness. On Tuesday, Newsom revealed details of his plan to borrow $4.68 billion for 10,000 new treatment beds as well as community-based housing for people with severe mental health and substance use disorders. That plan would include an overhaul of a voter-approved law from 2004 that imposed a tax on millionaires to fund mental health services. \n Dr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the state’s health and human services agency, said he hopes the expansion will fill a critical need in services. But Dr. Kushel, the study’s lead investigator, said most people who are homeless and struggling with behavioral health impairments do not require intensive, in-patient treatment. Rather, she said, they need housing paired with “really robust services” and she hopes the state gets the balance right. “The root of the problem is housing, and if we want people to recover, to heal, it’s really impossible to do that when they’re homeless,” she said.  Newsom’s plan must first pass the state Legislature this year. If it does, it would go to voters in March 2024. Of those surveyed, 45% reported current, regular use of cocaine, amphetamines and opioids, or heavy episodic drinking. Some participants described how heavy substance use contributed to losing their homes, while others attributed their ability to stay alert and to protect themselves from assault or theft to methamphetamine usage. Kushel’s team surveyed nearly 3,200 adults around California, and followed up to conduct in-depth interviews with 365 people, between October 2021 and November 2022. The study found that Black people made up 26% of the homeless population in a state where they are only 6% of the general population. About 90% of participants were living in California when they became homeless. Half reported an inability to work due to age, health or disability. The median length of homelessness was a little under two years.  More than a third of adults surveyed met the criteria for chronic homelessness, meaning they had a disabling condition and were homeless for at least 1 year — or were homeless four times in the previous three years totaling more than 12 months. In Los Angeles in 2015, Sage Johnson’s mother was evicted from their apartment when she was unable to meet rent that had increased to $1,200. In disability pay, she received about $1,340 a month. She bounced around, from LA’s notorious Skid Row to various convalescent homes while her daughter lived at a shelter.  Later, Johnson, 28, was able to place her mother in a home, where she stayed for about two years. In 2018 though, her mother died from a debilitating stroke. Johnson, who now has stable housing, wishes she could have done more.  “But in the end, she did have a bed. She was inside. She didn’t have any more strokes outside. And she was able to regenerate and rejuvenate and restore some of her life while in the convalescent home,” said Johnson, a co-chair for one of the study’s advisory boards.  Nearly half of the adults surveyed were not on a lease in the six months prior to becoming homeless, and had likely moved in with family or friends, contributing to rent when they could. Nearly a quarter cited conflict among housemates, desire for more space or not wanting to impose any longer on family and friends as primary reasons they left.  On average, people surveyed who were not on leases received only one day of warning before needing to move out. Among people on rental lease agreements, more than 20% cited income loss or reduction as the primary reason they lost housing. “So it wasn’t so much that their housing costs increased, it’s that they could no longer keep up with it,” said Kushel.  California ranks as the most unaffordable state when it comes to housing, according to an annual report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. A person earning an hourly minimum wage of $15.50 would have to work nearly 90 hours a week to afford the statewide average for a modest one-bedroom rental, which is nearly $1,800 a month, the coalition states. The study was requested by Newsom’s administration, but the state did not fund it so didn’t play a role in analyzing data or interpreting the findings.  The report makes many recommendations, including expansion of rental assistance and cash assistance to struggling households, as well as pilot programs to facilitate shared housing. \n \n  \n \n Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

    "onlytext": "Homeless people in California are already a vulnerable group, often struggling with poor health, trauma and deep poverty before they lose their housing, according to a new study on adult homelessness. The study released Tuesday by the University of California, San Francisco attempts to capture a comprehensive picture of how people become homeless in California, and what impeded their efforts at finding permanent housing. The representative survey of nearly 3,200 homeless people found that when they lost housing, their median household income was $960 a month, and for renters on leases it was $1,400 a month, of which on average half went to rent.  “People are homeless because their rent is too high. And their options are too few. And they have no cushion,” said Dr. Margot Kushel, lead investigator and director of UCSF’s Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative. “And it really makes you wonder how different things would look if we could solve that underlying problem.” Homelessness is a national crisis, and all too pervasive in California, where an estimated 171,000 people — or 30% of all homeless people in the U.S. — are homeless. Political leaders are divided over how to address the crisis, with some, including Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, favoring tent encampment sweeps and a tough-love approach toward those with mental health and addiction issues. It it not groundbreaking news that the state’s exorbitant housing costs are a major driver behind homelessness, but researchers hope their study will strengthen public support for policies that focus on offering housing and emergency rental assistance — rather than policies emphasizing punishment or stigma. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. \n Voters could soon get a chance to weigh in on the state’s latest approach to addressing homelessness. On Tuesday, Newsom revealed details of his plan to borrow $4.68 billion for 10,000 new treatment beds as well as community-based housing for people with severe mental health and substance use disorders. That plan would include an overhaul of a voter-approved law from 2004 that imposed a tax on millionaires to fund mental health services. \n Dr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the state’s health and human services agency, said he hopes the expansion will fill a critical need in services. But Dr. Kushel, the study’s lead investigator, said most people who are homeless and struggling with behavioral health impairments do not require intensive, in-patient treatment. Rather, she said, they need housing paired with “really robust services” and she hopes the state gets the balance right. “The root of the problem is housing, and if we want people to recover, to heal, it’s really impossible to do that when they’re homeless,” she said.  Newsom’s plan must first pass the state Legislature this year. If it does, it would go to voters in March 2024. Of those surveyed, 45% reported current, regular use of cocaine, amphetamines and opioids, or heavy episodic drinking. Some participants described how heavy substance use contributed to losing their homes, while others attributed their ability to stay alert and to protect themselves from assault or theft to methamphetamine usage. Kushel’s team surveyed nearly 3,200 adults around California, and followed up to conduct in-depth interviews with 365 people, between October 2021 and November 2022. The study found that Black people made up 26% of the homeless population in a state where they are only 6% of the general population. About 90% of participants were living in California when they became homeless. Half reported an inability to work due to age, health or disability. The median length of homelessness was a little under two years.  More than a third of adults surveyed met the criteria for chronic homelessness, meaning they had a disabling condition and were homeless for at least 1 year — or were homeless four times in the previous three years totaling more than 12 months.

But when children experience this, especially in early childhood, it can affect their health years down the line. That’s the finding of a new study in the journal Pediatrics, which says that teens who experienced housing insecurity earlier in life were more likely to report worse health. “Pediatricians, for a long time, have suspected that housing insecurity is associated with negative health outcomes,” says Dr. Hemen Muleta, a pediatrician at The Children’s Hospital at Montefiore in New York City. But this is important evidence from a longitudinal study that follows children from infancy to adolescence and connects their experiences of housing insecurity with long term health, she adds. The Future of Families and Child Well-Being study has been following a group of children across the country since their birth over 20 years ago. Researcher Kristyn Pierce and her colleague in the department of pediatrics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine mined data from that study to get a good sense of kids’ experiences with housing from birth to age 15. “We took measures of housing insecurity that were collected throughout their participation,” says Pierce. That included indicators like “homelessness, eviction, doubling up, meaning like overcrowding in the house and spending a night in a place that wasn't meant for residents and also difficulty paying for rent or mortgage.” A majority of the kids in the study – 47% – had stable housing throughout the study. “There was not one indicator [of housing insecurity] throughout their 15 years of participation,” says Pierce. A similarly large group – 46% – was what Pierce and her colleagues call “moderately insecure.” “Maybe they just had insecurity at one time point, and then were fully secure at another one,” says Pierce. “So it was sort of fluctuating and low.” The third and smallest group – 6% of the study population – had high levels of housing insecurity, especially in early childhood, but with stable housing later on. Kids with any level of housing insecurity – low or high – had worse self-reported health at age 15, says Pierce. They also reported worse mental health. “Children in both insecure groups reported higher levels of depression,” says Pierce. “And then only those in the highly insecure group reported higher levels of anxiety.” Most past studies have looked at the health impacts of housing problems in adults, says Rahil Briggs, the national director of Healthy Steps, a program that supports low income families with kids between the ages of zero and three. “This study is really important in terms of focusing our attention on teens,” says Briggs, who wasn’t involved in the new study. “Everything we know about [early] childhood is that it's the most critically important time to get your foundation right,” she adds. So it makes sense that experiencing housing instability in those early years would affect health in adolescence. This goes back to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, explains Briggs. “It's got five levels to it. And at the very, very bottom is what they call physiological needs breathing, food, water, sleep and shelter,” she says. “So just as foundational as breathing and water and food and sleep is this idea of shelter.” The absence of a safe and secure shelter creates “chronic and unrelenting” stress for the parents or caregivers, which is then picked up by kids, as well. “The acute stress of the parent and chronic stress with parents leads to dysregulation in children,” which in turn affects their development and mental health down the line. “It tells us that, you know, you need to intervene early,” says Dr. Suzette Oyeku, a pediatrician and the chief of Division of Academic General Pediatrics at Montefiore and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. That early intervention starts with screening families with young children, says Dr. Carol Duh-Leong, a pediatrician at Hassenfeld Children's Hospital NYU Langone and co-author of the new study. “As a primary care pediatrician, I'm a big believer in the primary care clinic as sort of a population health based place where we can reach a lot of children, especially young children.” Pediatricians who are part of the Healthy Steps effort already screen families with newborns up to age three several times during well-child visits . “Ninety percent of young children regularly attend well-child visits. It is the single and only setting that we have in this country to regularly reach young children in their families. Furthermore, families trust pediatricians,” Briggs says. It’s something Montefiore has also been doing. “Here at Montefiore, we screen all of our clinic pediatric patients for social needs,” says Muleta, including housing insecurity. Both at Healthy Steps clinics and at Montefiore, families who need help with housing are connected to resources in the community through a social worker or a community health worker. Montefiore’s Community Health Worker Institute, which opened in 2021, has reached more than 6,000 families with social needs, including housing, says Oyeku. However, Muleta admits that “of all the social needs that we screen for and intervene upon, I would say that housing insecurity is probably one of the most difficult and the longest to be able to resolve.” It’s a reality tied to the limited availability of affordable housing, she adds.

You are free to republish it so long as you do the following:\t This article was produced in partnership with The Southern Illinoisan, which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network. When I pulled my Jeep into the Clay Arsenal neighborhood in Hartford, Connecticut, in July, I knew intuitively that I had arrived by the sights of neglect: Beautifully crafted brick homes in varying stages of decay. Boarded up buildings. A feeling of isolation in an otherwise bustling city. I had driven 1,100 miles from southern Illinois for an appointment with Josh Serrano. He was among a handful of tenants who had led a monthslong campaign to implore the city and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to take action against an absentee landlord over poor conditions. I wanted to meet Serrano because I had covered poor living conditions and seeming federal indifference in places like the Illinois cities of Cairo and East St. Louis, in my region, and he was optimistic that by speaking with one voice, a community could achieve change. I recognized Serrano’s neighborhood from online photographs. It’s what journalists would call “distressed,” a catchall word that quickly and diplomatically describes many of the places I visited this year while reporting on the affordable housing challenges facing economically struggling rural towns and midsize cities for The Southern Illinoisan, and supported by ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network. But the word distressed, as one might also describe a favorite leather jacket or piece of reclaimed furniture, has never felt like a strong enough descriptor for the virus of political indifference that plagues these places and the people who call them home. Forget the rural-urban divide. Places like Serrano’s neighborhood in Hartford and the southern Illinois region I call home are connected by a resource gap as much as or more than we are divided by geographic boundaries. Few issues make that more apparent than the nation’s affordable housing crisis. I knocked on Serrano’s door and he led a photographer and me upstairs. Serrano is 26 years old. He’s lived in this neighborhood his entire life. Before he was born, his mother moved to Hartford from Puerto Rico with his two older brothers, searching for opportunity. About 13 years ago, Serrano said his mom moved the family into a federally subsidized property, where she raised him, his brothers and four foster siblings who are cousins. It was fine at first, he said, but complaints about safety concerns went unaddressed in more recent years. A number of tenants, including his mom, were afraid to speak out because they feared losing their homes and ending up in a worse predicament, he said. Finally, Serrano said he’d had enough. Around his kitchen table, Serrano told me how he and a half-dozen of his neighbors met for hours each week over the course of months studying HUD policies, canvassing their neighborhood to gather feedback from other renters and pushing for accountability as the rats multiplied and the mold grew inside their homes. Eventually, the tenants won action from HUD. In May, the agency announced that it was ending its contract with Serrano’s landlord, and that he and the 150 families living in his building and others would receive vouchers to subsidize their rent in the private market. But it’s hard to celebrate the dismantling of a neighborhood and the loss of affordable housing, even if that’s the best of bad options. There is a shortage of subsidized four- and five- bedroom units in Hartford, the state capital, making it challenging for some larger families to find alternative rentals that will accept their vouchers, commonly known as Section 8, in the neighborhoods where they want to live. At the start of the year, my goal was to explore HUD’s failure to enforce legal standards for decent, safe, sanitary housing in apartments subsidized by federal tax dollars, particularly in regions like mine that modern-day HUD policy seems to have left behind. I visited Evansville, Indiana; Wellston, Missouri; Steubenville, Ohio; Peoria, Illinois; and Hudson, New York, and found that they are all dealing with similar challenges. What started as a simple premise brought to light much greater challenges. HUD’s oversight failures are profound, and they have left thousands of children and their families, seniors and people with disabilities living in unsafe housing for years. As landlords have slapped paint over mold, cardboard over holes, and hid problems behind walls and “Do Not Enter” signs, the agency has often looked the other way. But these failures are symptomatic of much broader problems. To some extent, HUD has been put in an impossible position, starved for years by congressional budget cuts and lacking adequate staffing levels to monitor public and private landlords. Republicans have spent years eviscerating HUD, beginning with the Reagan administration and accelerating after the GOP won control of Congress in 1994, promising to rein in spending on social welfare programs. Chronic underfunding has persisted since then, especially for programs that fund public housing authorities. More recently, some have blamed HUD Secretary Ben Carson, trained as a neurosurgeon, as problems deepened, and his administration has done little to dislodge the inertia. But few Democratic politicians have publicly championed public housing or prioritized HUD either. As buildings age, HUD is increasingly looking to the private sector to fund a backlog of repairs and to provide new affordable units, and the agency has offered few solutions to those places that cannot attract private landlords to replace what’s being lost to neglect. These policies are based on the belief that housing should follow the economy, thereby encouraging low-income families to move into areas with more opportunities for jobs and education. While that makes for a great political pitch, it infrequently plays out that way in reality. The shortcomings of this push toward privatization are felt most in struggling rural towns and midsize cities — the places that rely the most heavily on HUD. This allows old, unsafe housing to deteriorate beyond the point of repair. In the midst of a nationwide affordable housing crisis, the agency is sometimes forced to choose between looking the other way despite knowledge of unsafe conditions or forcing tenants to leave and find their way in a tight housing market with few better alternatives. This has paralyzed HUD, forcing agency officials to run from one embarrassing oversight failure to the next instead of creating systems and policies that proactively improve access to affordable housing. Just last month, HUD told city officials in Wellston that it planned to dissolve the housing authority on Jan. 1, and then demolish or sell all of its public housing units. Nearly a fifth of Wellston’s 2,300 citizens live in public housing. Behind closed doors, a senior HUD official told Wellston’s council members that it was a tough decision to make, but that the federal government isn’t investing in public housing like it once did. When Carson visited Cairo in August 2017, four months after agency officials told families their 1940s-era apartments would be torn down and not replaced, he told tenants that it “seems unfair” that people have to suffer the consequences of past failures, “but that’s the world we live in. There’s a lot of unfairness in the world.” But unfairness implies some sort of bad luck beyond one’s circumstances, like a person who has never smoked but is diagnosed with lung cancer. The housing challenges in evidence today are solvable, advocates say, and ignoring them amounts to injustice. As my year working with ProPublica draws to a close, I’m left with more questions than answers. Among them: Why will HUD officials only acknowledge what’s happening to their agency and the people they serve behind closed doors? Why are so few people aware that the dismantling of HUD over many years is having a devastating effect on communities? When will politicians stop pretending they are surprised and outraged by massive housing failures from Cairo to New York after decades of funding and staff cuts and indifference? As I left Hartford, I wondered what would become of Serrano and his neighborhood. Several months later, Serrano told me by phone that he’d found another place nearby. He started working part time for the neighborhood advocacy organization that helped him and the other tenants organize, and he hopes to be able to pass on what he learned to others in similar situations. “I’m not trying to sugarcoat it,” he said of the neighborhood’s challenges, including crime. “But what people don’t see is the other side of it: the love out here, the care we take of each other.” Molly Parker is an investigative reporter, focusing on public housing, for The Southern Illinoisan.

A number of tenants, including his mom, were afraid to speak out because they feared losing their homes and ending up in a worse predicament, he said.\n\nFinally, Serrano said he’d had enough. Around his kitchen table, Serrano told me how he and a half-dozen of his neighbors met for hours each week over the course of months studying HUD policies, canvassing their neighborhood to gather feedback from other renters and pushing for accountability as the rats multiplied and the mold grew inside their homes. Eventually, the tenants won action from HUD. In May, the agency announced that it was ending its contract with Serrano’s landlord, and that he and the 150 families living in his building and others would receive vouchers to subsidize their rent in the private market.\n\nBut it’s hard to celebrate the dismantling of a neighborhood and the loss of affordable housing, even if that’s the best of bad options. There is a shortage of subsidized four- and five- bedroom units in Hartford, the state capital, making it challenging for some larger families to find alternative rentals that will accept their vouchers, commonly known as Section 8, in the neighborhoods where they want to live.\n\nAt the start of the year, my goal was to explore HUD’s failure to enforce legal standards for decent, safe, sanitary housing in apartments subsidized by federal tax dollars, particularly in regions like mine that modern-day HUD policy seems to have left behind. I visited Evansville, Indiana; Wellston, Missouri; Steubenville, Ohio; Peoria, Illinois; and Hudson, New York, and found that they are all dealing with similar challenges.\n\nWhat started as a simple premise brought to light much greater challenges. HUD’s oversight failures are profound, and they have left thousands of children and their families, seniors and people with disabilities living in unsafe housing for years. As landlords have slapped paint over mold, cardboard over holes, and hid problems behind walls and “Do Not Enter” signs, the agency has often looked the other way.\n\nBut these failures are symptomatic of much broader problems. To some extent, HUD has been put in an impossible position, starved for years by congressional budget cuts and lacking adequate staffing levels to monitor public and private landlords. Republicans have spent years eviscerating HUD, beginning with the Reagan administration and accelerating after the GOP won control of Congress in 1994, promising to rein in spending on social welfare programs. Chronic underfunding has persisted since then, especially for programs that fund public housing authorities.\n\nMore recently, some have blamed HUD Secretary Ben Carson, trained as a neurosurgeon, as problems deepened, and his administration has done little to dislodge the inertia. But few Democratic politicians have publicly championed public housing or prioritized HUD either.\n\nAs buildings age, HUD is increasingly looking to the private sector to fund a backlog of repairs and to provide new affordable units, and the agency has offered few solutions to those places that cannot attract private landlords to replace what’s being lost to neglect. These policies are based on the belief that housing should follow the economy, thereby encouraging low-income families to move into areas with more opportunities for jobs and education. While that makes for a great political pitch, it infrequently plays out that way in reality.\n\nThe shortcomings of this push toward privatization are felt most in struggling rural towns and midsize cities — the places that rely the most heavily on HUD. This allows old, unsafe housing to deteriorate beyond the point of repair. In the midst of a nationwide affordable housing crisis, the agency is sometimes forced to choose between looking the other way despite knowledge of unsafe conditions or forcing tenants to leave and find their way in a tight housing market with few better alternatives.\n\nThis has paralyzed HUD, forcing agency officials to run from one embarrassing oversight failure to the next instead of creating systems and policies that proactively improve access to affordable housing. Just last month, HUD told city officials in Wellston that it planned to dissolve the housing authority on Jan. 1, and then demolish or sell all of its public housing units. Nearly a fifth of Wellston’s 2,300 citizens live in public housing.\n\nBehind closed doors, a senior HUD official told Wellston’s council members that it was a tough decision to make, but that the federal government isn’t investing in public housing like it once did. When Carson visited Cairo in August 2017, four months after agency officials told families their 1940s-era apartments would be torn down and not replaced, he told tenants that it “seems unfair” that people have to suffer the consequences of past failures, “but that’s the world we live in. There’s a lot of unfairness in the world.”\n\nBut unfairness implies some sort of bad luck beyond one’s circumstances, like a person who has never smoked but is diagnosed with lung cancer. The housing challenges in evidence today are solvable, advocates say, and ignoring them amounts to injustice.\n\nAs my year working with ProPublica draws to a close, I’m left with more questions than answers. Among them: Why will HUD officials only acknowledge what’s happening to their agency and the people they serve behind closed doors? Why are so few people aware that the dismantling of HUD over many years is having a devastating effect on communities? When will politicians stop pretending they are surprised and outraged by massive housing failures from Cairo to New York after decades of funding and staff cuts and indifference?\n\nAs I left Hartford, I wondered what would become of Serrano and his neighborhood. Several months later, Serrano told me by phone that he’d found another place nearby. He started working part time for the neighborhood advocacy organization that helped him and the other tenants organize, and he hopes to be able to pass on what he learned to others in similar situations. “I’m not trying to sugarcoat it,” he said of the neighborhood’s challenges, including crime. “But what people don’t see is the other side of it: the love out here, the care we take of each other.”",

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration is under fire for signing off on a building plan that allows a new luxury high-rise on Manhattan's western edge to have a separate entrance for low-income residents. About 20 percent of the units in the 33-story tower will be reserved for low- and middle-income residents. But all the affordable units will be grouped in one area, and those tenants will have to enter through a separate door. \"This developer must go back, seal the one door and make it so all residents go through the same door,\" City Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal said. \"It's a disgrace.\" Rosenthal is demanding an end to what some here have dubbed the \"poor door.\" Civil rights attorneys say a significant number of tenants in the subsidized apartments could be minorities. Lawyer Randolph McLaughlin says that makes the building's design more than disgraceful â€” and possibly illegal. \"To permit developers or encourage them to create separate and unequal buildings and take tax credits and benefits from the city,\" he said, \"I think that's a constitutional violation.\" The developer, Extell Development, defends the two doors, saying it complied with zoning laws by essentially creating two separate buildings. Housing advocates say Extell is exploiting a loophole in the laws, while City Hall blames the prior administration for creating those laws and approving the deal. De Blasio swept into office promising to address income inequality. \"The plans for this building were submitted and construction commenced on the project in 2013, prior to the new mayor being elected,\" said Alicia Glen, the deputy mayor for housing and economic development. Extell's president, Gary Barnett, said the zoning law is aimed at creating more affordable housing. In this building, he said, the affordable units will rent for about $15 a square foot, whereas market-rate units will fetch five or six times that. \"Would you rather not have the affordable housing? Ask any one of the thousands of people who are applying for that, and they don't give a damn,\" he said. \"They want to have a beautiful apartment, in a beautiful neighborhood, and you know, at a super price.\" But some New Yorkers aren't persuaded by that super price. \"Once again we're putting segregation right upfront, and we're making it legal to segregate people,\" a caller from Queens said on WNYC's Brian Lehrer Show. On streets near the new building, it was hard to find a resident who would mind a separate entrance in exchange for a sweet, cheap rental. \"I definitely understand why people would be upset, but I would not take it too personally,\" said Roman Golubov, who lives in a subsidized apartment. \"If I had the opportunity to live in a skyscraper and I had to walk through the poor door, I'd get over it.\" Meanwhile, City Hall is trying to get over the controversy. Officials are promising a comprehensive review of the zoning laws and say they will work to close the poor-door loophole. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

She's been withholding rent in an effort to get her landlord to fix up the apartment.\n                \n                    \n                    Pam Fessler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Terrell Walker says that her apartment in Washington, D.C., has mold and problems with heating and old appliances. She's been withholding rent in an effort to get her landlord to fix up the apartment. Terrell Walker lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Southeast Washington, D.C., with her 9-year-old and 2-year-old daughters. Walker stopped paying her rent last September because, she says, her apartment is in horrible condition — and she is fighting her landlord's eviction threat in court. But when tenants don't pay, landlords say they have less money to fix things up. It is a vicious cycle that can often land the parties in court, and it's a scene that has become common around the country. The lack of affordable housing is forcing low-income renters to choose between apartments they can't afford or those that aren't in the best shape. A Frustrating Legal Process When Walker is at her job as a coach for disabled workers, her mother, Patsy Yates, watches the girls. Yates shows me the conditions of her daughter's apartment one day when she is looking after the children. \"If you sit right here by this window, like you're sitting watching TV, the wind is coming in the window so bad that you can feel it,\" Yates says. \"The bathroom is extra cold. The bedroom back there is extra cold. So I usually try to boil some water or something to try to keep it warm in here.\" But she says that's dangerous with a little child running around. \"And you don't never know when she's going to hit that stove,\" Yates says. \n                Walker's mother, Patsy Yates, shows where cold air comes in around the window frames.  She says it's so cold sometimes that she boils pots of water on the stove to help warm the apartment.\n                \n                    \n                    Pam Fessler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n The apartment is crowded for three people. In the living room, there's a bed with a bright pink comforter. The building is more than 50 years old. The baseboard heaters are falling away from the wall, although they're warm to the touch. Then, Yates has me feel around the window frames. \"You see, you feel the wind. It doesn't stay warm in here,\" she says. There is a breeze, at least where there's no newspaper stuffed into the cracks. Yates also says the appliances are old and don't work that well. In the bathroom, the tub's finish is all worn off and corroded around the drain. The landlord never glazed the tub properly, she says. \"Inspector asked them to reglaze it. He ain't done that.\" Yates says her daughter and grandchildren also had a bedbug infestation last year, which makes paying $727 a month in rent seem like an insult. A week later, Walker is at the Landlord and Tenant Branch of the D.C. Superior Court. \"I'm basically just here today to try to get justice,\" she says. It's the second time she's been in this court since her landlord sued her last November for not paying the rent. Walker has asked for a trial so she can make her case that she shouldn't have to pay until the place is fixed up. Like other tenants, Walker carries what she hopes will be evidence: a manila envelope filled with papers including lead inspection reports, photos and her handwritten list of everything she says is wrong with the apartment. \"I've complained about it and I've got nothing done,\" she says. Still, the legal process is time-consuming and frustrating. That day, there was supposed to be a hearing to decide how much money she should pay into escrow during the trial. But the landlord's witness didn't show up. After three hours, the parties agreed to postpone the hearing — but Walker had already taken off work, losing a whole day's pay. \"[That is] something that I really can't afford, for them to basically tell me that I have to come back again, you know to take off,\" she says. \"So it's like nothing really got solved today.\" That's how it often goes in the court. Few tenants have attorneys — which can put them at a disadvantage because almost every landlord has a lawyer. Landlords Need To Get Paid, Too Aaron Sokolow represents Walker's landlord. He wouldn't talk about her specific case, but he did say low-income renters aren't as powerless as it might seem, especially in Washington, where tenant protections are strong. \n                Aaron Sokolow, a Washington, D.C., real estate lawyer, works in his office. Sokolow says some tenants use complaints about poor conditions to justify not paying their rent. He says his clients need rent payments so they can pay their bills and maintain the apartments.\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Chew/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n \"In my experience, there's very little risk that a tenant will flat out lose a case because they don't understand what's going on,\" Sokolow says. Instead, some tenants have become adept at claiming housing code violations to avoid paying rent, he says. They could take their complaints to a separate housing conditions court. Instead, he says, they go to the landlord tenant branch, where they can drag the process out for months — during which time the landlord doesn't get paid. \"And that's a great frustration for a lot of my clients. They say, 'I'm not excused of my tax payment; I'm not excused of my mortgage payment,' \" Sokolow says. \"So the notion that I have to come out of pocket for 18 months of litigation, it can get very daunting, very quickly.\" \n                Art Nalls owns the Mount Dome Apartments in Southeast Washington, D.C. Nalls says he tries to provide good, decent, affordable housing but needs people to pay their rent to do that.\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Chew/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Art Nalls is a landlord with two buildings in the city. Nalls thinks it's important that low-income residents have a decent place to live. \"We try to take care of people and we try to offer good decent, affordable housing at a reasonable rate,\" he says. But if people don't pay their rent, Nalls says, it's hard to do. \"It means that I can't cover all that other stuff. So I have to call my refrigerator guy and say, 'I'm going to have to pay you next month when I get rent,' \" he says. \"It's that tight. We're not making a bazillion dollars here.\" Nalls thinks one answer is more government subsidies for low-income housing. Otherwise, he says, landlords get tired of the hassle and sell out, which can mean fewer decent, affordable housing units. According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, the number of low-cost rental units grew only 10 percent over the past decade, while the number of low-income renters grew 40 percent. Shortage Of Affordable And Safe Housing \"When I turned this on last Saturday, when I flicked this right here, electricity shot out,\" says Pamula Glover, who was showing me the thermostat in her apartment in Southeast Washington. \n                Pamula Glover points to cracks in her ceiling caused by water damage (top left) and goes through her photos on her phone of other problems in her apartment (top right). Glover, who lives with her two cats, doesn't feel safe (bottom).\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Chew/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Glover was recently in landlord tenant court with some neighbors who were being sued for not paying their rent. Glover says she has water leaks, mold and a constantly beeping fire alarm. She admits $815 a month for a two-bedroom apartment is a bargain, but she still wants to live in a place that is comfortable and safe. \"We don't even have security around here no more. They shoot around here like it's a job,\" Glover says. She says the gunfire is so bad at night she sleeps at an angle in her first-floor bedroom to stay out of the line of fire. The company that runs her apartment, Oakmont Management, refused to comment when contacted. It's being sued by the city for unlivable conditions at another apartment complex. Glover says her place has been allowed to go downhill. She grew up nearby and recalls looking at these apartments, thinking they were so nice, that if she lived in one of these buildings, she'd be rich. Glover, who lives on disability payments, says now she doesn't know where else to go. Neither does Walker, who doesn't make much above minimum wage. \n                Pamula Glover's apartment complex is located in a Washington, D.C., neighborhood plagued by gun violence.\n                \n                    \n                    Brandon Chew/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n Pamula Glover's apartment complex is located in a Washington, D.C., neighborhood plagued by gun violence. \"I honestly think for me, to get into a decent home with my income, it would be very hard ... because I wouldn't be able to afford it,\" she says. \"Not with the prices that they have these days.\" Anything more than $800 a month is out of her league, Walker says. But anything under $800 is pretty much what she already has. This story was produced for broadcast by Evie Stone. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

She admits $815 a month for a two-bedroom apartment is a bargain, but she still wants to live in a place that is comfortable and safe. \"We don't even have security around here no more. They shoot around here like it's a job,\" Glover says. She says the gunfire is so bad at night she sleeps at an angle in her first-floor bedroom to stay out of the line of fire.\n\nThe company that runs her apartment, Oakmont Management, refused to comment when contacted. It's being sued by the city for unlivable conditions at another apartment complex. Glover says her place has been allowed to go downhill. She grew up nearby and recalls looking at these apartments, thinking they were so nice, that if she lived in one of these buildings, she'd be rich. Glover, who lives on disability payments, says now she doesn't know where else to go. Neither does Walker, who doesn't make much above minimum wage.\n\n\"I honestly think for me, to get into a decent home with my income, it would be very hard ... because I wouldn't be able to afford it,\" she says. \"Not with the prices that they have these days.\" Anything more than $800 a month is out of her league, Walker says. But anything under $800 is pretty much what she already has.",

    "text": "More than 40 years ago, economist John Kenneth Galbraith wrote that trickle-down economics was around in the late 1800s and was known then as horse-and-sparrow economics. The horse-and-sparrow theory posits that if you feed a horse an abundance of oats, some of the oats will pass through the horse and plop on the road for the sparrows to eat. In Galbraith’s apt but unappetizing metaphor, the ultra-wealthy and big corporations are the horse and the rest of us are the sparrows. A recent Asheville Citizen Times headline read, “Top 1% richer than the entire middle class.” According to the article, 30 years ago, the middle class — the middle 60% of American households based upon income — held twice as much wealth as the top 1%, but today the top 1% hold more wealth than the entire middle class. It seems not many oats passed through the horse and on to the sparrows. The article is based on Federal Reserve data that is available on its website. The data shows that as of mid-2023, the top 1% of Americans amassed $45.78 trillion in wealth. The ultra-elite of that group, the top one-tenth of 1% — think Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk — account for $18.63 trillion. The overwhelming majority of Americans — those in the 0-90% range — hold $45.38 trillion. In other words, the top 1% of Americans are worth more than the bottom 90%. To make the disparity even more stark, the combined wealth of the bottom half of Americans is $3.64 trillion, which is one-fifth the wealth of the top one-tenth of 1%. To put that into context, if a thousand people who are representative of wealth distribution in America were in a room, one person in the room would be worth five times more than 500 others combined. According to the Economic Policy Institute, between 1979-2021, adjusted for inflation, wages for the bottom 90% of Americans grew by 29% while wages for the top 1% soared by 206%. The top 1% controls nearly 13% of all real estate wealth and owns nearly half of all the shares in stocks and mutual funds, which are record highs. If the trend continues, the gulf between the uber rich and the rest of America will keep expanding. No one factor explains the disproportionate accumulation of wealth by the top 1%. Clearly, the Reagan-Bush-Trump tax cuts that saw most of the benefits go to those at the top exacerbated the disparity. Several years ago, billionaire Warren Buffett noted that it was unfair for his secretary to pay a higher tax rate than him and he advocated for tax reform to reduce the disproportionate burden on working Americans. Rather than reform and greater fairness, we got more tax cuts that funneled more oats to the horse, expanded the national debt, and left the sparrows standing in the road picking at the dregs. In 2021, Amazon had $35.1 billion in earnings and paid $2.1 billion in income tax, for a tax rate of 6%. Had it not been for tax breaks, Amazon would have paid $7.3 billion for a tax rate of 21%. For some reason, breaks that benefit the wealthy are lauded as “incentives” while breaks that benefit others are derided as “welfare.” Recall that Congressman Chuck Edwards opposed what he disparaged as President Biden’s “student loan giveaway plan” that would have benefited millions of ordinary Americans with up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness while our multimillionaire congressman banked $1.1 million in Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness that fattened his own wallet in true “good for me, but not for thee” fashion. The economic elites use their wealth effectively to manipulate those who aren’t rich to believe that it’s their patriotic or religious duty to vote against their own interests. They sold low wages and poor working conditions as the “right to work,” opposition to programs that help the disadvantaged as “socialism,” and tax cuts that make the rich richer and increase the national debt as magnificent trickle-down job creation wonders. Facts don’t lie, people do, and the facts prove that Galbraith’s metaphorical horse has gotten fat and bloated while the sparrows grew lean. That won’t change until the horse and the sparrows eat shoulder to shoulder rather than the horse feasting while the sparrows look up at its behind hoping that a little will pass through to them. Moe Davis is a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, attorney, former administrative law judge and former N.C. 11th Congressional District candidate. He is currently writing a historical fiction novel set in Western North Carolina. ",

But economists say there's a balance. Income inequality is a big problem, many economists agree. But they also say some level of inequality is necessary for capitalism to work. Inequality in the U.S. has risen to levels not seen since the 1920s. The top 1 percent pocket more than 20 percent of the nation's income, and the 400 richest people in the country own more wealth than everyone in the bottom 50 percent. That's not healthy for the society or the economy, says Branko Milanovic, an economist at the City University of New York Graduate Center. For one thing, he says, it undermines the idea of equal opportunity. \"It makes some people excluded or poor and unable to actually, for example, go to school, complete studies and contribute to society,\" he says. That hurts individuals and, Milanovic says, it hurts the broader economy by not allowing a whole segment of society to be as productive as it could be. French economist Thomas Piketty has warned in his best-seller Capital in the Twenty-First Century that inequality is likely to grow. That's because capitalism tends to reward the owners of capital with a greater and greater share of the economy's output, he says. Meanwhile, wage-earners get a smaller and smaller share. Milanovic says that concentration of wealth is a threat to democracy. \"The elites start dominating the political discourse and even political decision-making, and then they reinforce their own privilege,\" he says. Still, Milanovic says some level of inequality is needed to make capitalism work. \"It provides incentives for harder work, study, investment and ... general desire to better one's condition and the condition of one's kids,\" he says. But what's the right level of inequality? Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, says whether a certain level of inequality is good or bad depends on how it came be. \"If your society has a lot of inequality because a lot of your producers have done very well selling their products on global markets, that kind of inequality is not harmful in general,\" he says. \"But if you have inequality because your poorer people don't have enough economic opportunity, I would say that is a big problem.\" Cowen thinks the big rise in incomes at the top in the U.S. is coming mostly for the right reasons. But he is concerned that incomes are stagnating for Americans in the middle and at the bottom. He believes that's partly the result of inadequate education and the high cost of health care and housing. There was a period of declining inequality in the U.S.: in the three decades after World War II. But, as Cowen points out, that happened because so much wealth and capital, like factories, were destroyed in the previous three decades by two world wars and the Great Depression. \"The relative equality following World War II was because we had destroyed so many things in the world and we needed to rebuild them, and that created a lot of middle-class jobs for people,\" he says. \"But short of having another world war, we cannot re-create those circumstances, and of course we shouldn't try to.\" But there were other reasons for a more equal distribution of income and wealth back then: higher taxes on the wealthy, for one. And, Harvard labor economist Richard Freeman says, there was another difference between then and now. \"One of the key factors in that period of time was very strong unions,\" he says. Those unions bargained with the owners of capital to give workers a larger share of the economy's output. But Freeman says we shouldn't look to unions, which are much weaker now, to have a big impact. In fact, he takes a very different tack. \"The capitalists are making money; everybody's got to be a bit of a capitalist,\" he says. That's an idea as old as America's beginnings, says Freeman. The founders, he says, thought broad ownership of land, a capital asset, was very important. \"That was being driven by the notion that if we don't make sure that everybody has an ownership stake in what was the capital of that time, we were going to end up with a class of rich people separate from the middle class, and that was not healthy for democracy,\" Freeman says. He advocates employee stock ownership and profit-sharing as tactics for closing America's inequality gap. Milanovic suggests substantial estate taxes and more equal taxation of labor and capital — currently income from labor is taxed at significantly higher levels. Cowen would focus on improving education and on making health care and housing more affordable to help people at the bottom do better. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "text": "ByTommy Beer, Former Staff. New data available from the U.S. Federal Reserve shows that the wealth gap in America has widened and economic inequality increased in 2020 amidst a coronavirus pandemic that has disproportionately impacted low-wage service workers and people of color, which coincides with a report published earlier this week showing that global billionaire wealth has concurrently skyrocketed at an unprecedented rate. According to the latest Fed data, the top 1% of Americans have a combined net worth of $34.2 trillion (or 30.4% of all household wealth in the U.S.), while the bottom 50% of the population holds just $2.1 trillion combined (or 1.9% of all wealth). A study published earlier this week by Swiss bank UBS and accounting firm PwC found that the total wealth of the world’s 2,189 billionaires soared to a record-setting high of $10.2 trillion in late July, obliterating the previous record of $8.9 trillion recorded at the end of 2017. American billionaires have grown significantly richer during the pandemic, led by Elon Musk, who crossed the $100 billion benchmark in August to become the world’s fifth centibillionaire, and saw his wealth increase by 242% over the first eight months of 2020 (Jeff Bezos has added $65 billion to his net worth this year). A critical factor in the explosion of wealth among a particular segment of the U.S. population has been access and exposure to the stock market.  The Fed estimates that the wealthiest 10% of Americans hold more than 88% of all available equity in corporations and mutual fund shares (with just the top 1% controlling more than twice as much equity as the bottom 50% of all Americans combined).  The numbers have been trending in this direction for a long time. The data provided by the Federal Reserve tracks back to 1989, and it shows that over the past three decades, the top 10% of U.S. households have seen their wealth rise by almost ten percentage points (from less than 61% of all wealth to 69%), while the total wealth controlled by the bottom 50% has been cut nearly in half (from 3.6% to 1.9%). While many middle- and upper-middle-class Americans have been able to work from home and reap the rewards of a robust stock market via their retirement accounts, those near the bottom of the economic ladder have been battered by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed the lives of more than 210,000 Americans and served to exacerbate financial inequalities. Last week, 840,000 people filed new unemployment claims. It’s the sixth consecutive week that new claims have exceeded 800,000. A total of 25.5 million are currently receiving some form of government unemployment benefit.",

    "text": "NPR's Steve Inskeep talks to David Wessel of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution about rising income inequality amid the longest period of economic expansion in U.S. history. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  What brought about another decade of growing income inequality in the United States? The 2010s began and ended with pushes against inequality. The Occupy Wall Street movement made headlines back in 2011. And right now, Democratic presidential candidates are pushing ideas like a wealth tax. Even President Trump has made references to some of his supporters as forgotten Americans.The longest economic expansion in U.S. history, which began in 2009, has finally brought up wages. Yet none of this changes the numbers noticed by David Wessel, director of The Hutchins Center at The Brookings Institution. David, welcome back.DAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Good morning.INSKEEP: And happy New Year. What are you seeing in the numbers?WESSEL: Well, most people's economic fortunes did improve during the 2010s as the economy slowly climbed out of this terrible Great Recession. But by almost any measure, the gap between the people at the very top and the rest of us continued to widen. There are a couple of economists at Berkeley - Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman - who've done a lot of work on this, and they say that the income before taxes of the top 1% is now a bigger share of the pie than at any time since the 1920s.And even after you take account of federal taxes and means-tested government programs like Medicare, which take money from the top and give it to people at the bottom, the Congressional Budget Office says that the overall incomes of the bottom fifth of the population rose by 34% after adjusting for inflation during the decade. But the incomes of the top fifth rose by 58%, a lot more.INSKEEP: Now, I'm thinking of that truism about a rising tide lifting all boats. The economy seems to be lifting all boats, but some people are way above the ocean in a private jet.WESSEL: Yeah, you could say that. We know that not everybody did better during the 2010s, but we know that there were fewer people living in poverty, for instance. And we know that it was a terrific decade to be in the billionaire class.INSKEEP: What has the stock market done, if anything, to income inequality over the last decade?WESSEL: Well, the stock market had a terrific decade. The Standard and Poor's 500 was up nine of the past 10 years, and this year was particularly strong. And what that does is it tends to widen wealth inequality. Income is people's paycheck. Wealth is what they own - stocks, bonds and houses. And because the top 1% hold half of all the stock market wealth in the country, when the stock market goes up, that widens the gap between the wealthy and other people. The 130,000 households at the very top - that's the top one-tenth of 1%, the 50 million and up crowd - hold 15% of all the wealth in America, and there are a lot of Americans who have no wealth at all.But one thing that's really important to most Americans is homeownership - the value of their home, not the stock markets, their major asset. And housing prices have been rising. That's good for people who own houses, not so good for people who want to buy them. But there is one striking disparity - 73% of non-Hispanic whites own their own homes but only 43% of blacks. And that gap has been widening. Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.INSKEEP: What proposals, if any that are out there, would appear to address the root causes?WESSEL: There are things like raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, requiring Uber and Lyft and other gig employers to treat their employees differently, investing in education, nutrition, health care for low-income kids. Those all tend to reduce inequality before taxes.And we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.INSKEEP: Is there any political consensus for redistributing wealth in any way? It's a thing that some Democrats favor but that a lot of Republicans don't.WESSEL: No. I don't think there is a consensus. I think there's widespread acknowledgement that the distribution of income and wealth in America is unequal. What you often hear from people on the right is they want to focus on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. So they are interested in what can we do to give poor people a chance to build a business, go to school, make it into the middle class, and they worry less than the people on the left do about these data that we've been discussing that suggests that the inequality of outcomes has grown.INSKEEP: David Wessel, always a pleasure talking with you.WESSEL: Happy New Year, Steve.INSKEEP: Happy New Year to you.

What are you seeing in the numbers?WESSEL: Well, most people's economic fortunes did improve during the 2010s as the economy slowly climbed out of this terrible Great Recession. But by almost any measure, the gap between the people at the very top and the rest of us continued to widen. There are a couple of economists at Berkeley - Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman - who've done a lot of work on this, and they say that the income before taxes of the top 1% is now a bigger share of the pie than at any time since the 1920s.And even after you take account of federal taxes and means-tested government programs like Medicare, which take money from the top and give it to people at the bottom, the Congressional Budget Office says that the overall incomes of the bottom fifth of the population rose by 34% after adjusting for inflation during the decade. But the incomes of the top fifth rose by 58%, a lot more.INSKEEP: Now, I'm thinking of that truism about a rising tide lifting all boats. The economy seems to be lifting all boats, but some people are way above the ocean in a private jet.WESSEL: Yeah, you could say that. We know that not everybody did better during the 2010s, but we know that there were fewer people living in poverty, for instance. And we know that it was a terrific decade to be in the billionaire class.INSKEEP: What has the stock market done, if anything, to income inequality over the last decade?WESSEL: Well, the stock market had a terrific decade. The Standard and Poor's 500 was up nine of the past 10 years, and this year was particularly strong. And what that does is it tends to widen wealth inequality. Income is people's paycheck. Wealth is what they own - stocks, bonds and houses. And because the top 1% hold half of all the stock market wealth in the country, when the stock market goes up, that widens the gap between the wealthy and other people. The 130,000 households at the very top - that's the top one-tenth of 1%, the 50 million and up crowd - hold 15% of all the wealth in America, and there are a lot of Americans who have no wealth at all.But one thing that's really important to most Americans is homeownership - the value of their home, not the stock markets, their major asset. And housing prices have been rising. That's good for people who own houses, not so good for people who want to buy them. But there is one striking disparity - 73% of non-Hispanic whites own their own homes but only 43% of blacks. And that gap has been widening. Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.INSKEEP: What proposals, if any that are out there, would appear to address the root causes?WESSEL: There are things like raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, requiring Uber and Lyft and other gig employers to treat their employees differently, investing in education, nutrition, health care for low-income kids. Those all tend to reduce inequality before taxes.And we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.INSKEEP: Is there any political consensus for redistributing wealth in any way? It's a thing that some Democrats favor but that a lot of Republicans don't.WESSEL: No. I don't think there is a consensus. I think there's widespread acknowledgement that the distribution of income and wealth in America is unequal. What you often hear from people on the right is they want to focus on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. So they are interested in what can we do to give poor people a chance to build a business, go to school, make it into the middle class, and they worry less than the people on the left do about these data that we've been discussing that suggests that the inequality of outcomes has grown.INSKEEP: David Wessel, always a pleasure talking with you.WESSEL: Happy New Year, Steve.INSKEEP: Happy New Year to you.

Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.INSKEEP: What proposals, if any that are out there, would appear to address the root causes?WESSEL: There are things like raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, requiring Uber and Lyft and other gig employers to treat their employees differently, investing in education, nutrition, health care for low-income kids. Those all tend to reduce inequality before taxes.And we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.INSKEEP: Is there any political consensus for redistributing wealth in any way? It's a thing that some Democrats favor but that a lot of Republicans don't.WESSEL: No. I don't think there is a consensus. I think there's widespread acknowledgement that the distribution of income and wealth in America is unequal. What you often hear from people on the right is they want to focus on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. So they are interested in what can we do to give poor people a chance to build a business, go to school, make it into the middle class, and they worry less than the people on the left do about these data that we've been discussing that suggests that the inequality of outcomes has grown.INSKEEP: David Wessel, always a pleasure talking with you.WESSEL: Happy New Year, Steve.INSKEEP: Happy New Year to you.

The economy seems to be lifting all boats, but some people are way above the ocean in a private jet.WESSEL: Yeah, you could say that. We know that not everybody did better during the 2010s, but we know that there were fewer people living in poverty, for instance. And we know that it was a terrific decade to be in the billionaire class.INSKEEP: What has the stock market done, if anything, to income inequality over the last decade?WESSEL: Well, the stock market had a terrific decade. The Standard and Poor's 500 was up nine of the past 10 years, and this year was particularly strong. And what that does is it tends to widen wealth inequality. Income is people's paycheck. Wealth is what they own - stocks, bonds and houses. And because the top 1% hold half of all the stock market wealth in the country, when the stock market goes up, that widens the gap between the wealthy and other people. The 130,000 households at the very top - that's the top one-tenth of 1%, the 50 million and up crowd - hold 15% of all the wealth in America, and there are a lot of Americans who have no wealth at all.But one thing that's really important to most Americans is homeownership - the value of their home, not the stock markets, their major asset. And housing prices have been rising. That's good for people who own houses, not so good for people who want to buy them. But there is one striking disparity - 73% of non-Hispanic whites own their own homes but only 43% of blacks. And that gap has been widening.

    "onlytext": "What brought about another decade of growing income inequality in the United States? The 2010s began and ended with pushes against inequality. The Occupy Wall Street movement made headlines back in 2011. And right now, Democratic presidential candidates are pushing ideas like a wealth tax. Even President Trump has made references to some of his supporters as forgotten Americans.\n\nThe longest economic expansion in U.S. history, which began in 2009, has finally brought up wages. Yet none of this changes the numbers noticed by David Wessel, director of The Hutchins Center at The Brookings Institution. David, welcome back.\n\nDAVID WESSEL, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: And happy New Year. What are you seeing in the numbers?\n\nWESSEL: Well, most people's economic fortunes did improve during the 2010s as the economy slowly climbed out of this terrible Great Recession. But by almost any measure, the gap between the people at the very top and the rest of us continued to widen. There are a couple of economists at Berkeley - Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman - who've done a lot of work on this, and they say that the income before taxes of the top 1% is now a bigger share of the pie than at any time since the 1920s.\n\nAnd even after you take account of federal taxes and means-tested government programs like Medicare, which take money from the top and give it to people at the bottom, the Congressional Budget Office says that the overall incomes of the bottom fifth of the population rose by 34% after adjusting for inflation during the decade. But the incomes of the top fifth rose by 58%, a lot more.\n\nINSKEEP: Now, I'm thinking of that truism about a rising tide lifting all boats. The economy seems to be lifting all boats, but some people are way above the ocean in a private jet.\n\nWESSEL: Yeah, you could say that. We know that not everybody did better during the 2010s, but we know that there were fewer people living in poverty, for instance. And we know that it was a terrific decade to be in the billionaire class.\n\nINSKEEP: What has the stock market done, if anything, to income inequality over the last decade?\n\nWESSEL: Well, the stock market had a terrific decade. The Standard and Poor's 500 was up nine of the past 10 years, and this year was particularly strong. And what that does is it tends to widen wealth inequality. Income is people's paycheck. Wealth is what they own - stocks, bonds and houses. And because the top 1% hold half of all the stock market wealth in the country, when the stock market goes up, that widens the gap between the wealthy and other people. The 130,000 households at the very top - that's the top one-tenth of 1%, the 50 million and up crowd - hold 15% of all the wealth in America, and there are a lot of Americans who have no wealth at all.\n\nBut one thing that's really important to most Americans is homeownership - the value of their home, not the stock markets, their major asset. And housing prices have been rising. That's good for people who own houses, not so good for people who want to buy them. But there is one striking disparity - 73% of non-Hispanic whites own their own homes but only 43% of blacks. And that gap has been widening. Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.\n\nINSKEEP: What proposals, if any that are out there, would appear to address the root causes?\n\nWESSEL: There are things like raising the minimum wage, strengthening unions, requiring Uber and Lyft and other gig employers to treat their employees differently, investing in education, nutrition, health care for low-income kids. Those all tend to reduce inequality before taxes.\n\nAnd we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.\n\nINSKEEP: Is there any political consensus for redistributing wealth in any way? It's a thing that some Democrats favor but that a lot of Republicans don't.\n\nWESSEL: No. I don't think there is a consensus. I think there's widespread acknowledgement that the distribution of income and wealth in America is unequal. What you often hear from people on the right is they want to focus on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. So they are interested in what can we do to give poor people a chance to build a business, go to school, make it into the middle class, and they worry less than the people on the left do about these data that we've been discussing that suggests that the inequality of outcomes has grown.\n\nINSKEEP: David Wessel, always a pleasure talking with you.\n\nWESSEL: Happy New Year, Steve.\n\nINSKEEP: Happy New Year to you.

    "text": "Michael Kazin, co-editor of the left-wing magazine Dissent, posed a simple question in a recent article: If wealth and income inequality levels are as bad as they are portrayed in popular media, “why aren’t people taking to the streets?” The statistics that describe the magnitude of economic inequality are stark. Before taking into account the effects of redistributive government programs, the richest 1% of Americans make 20% of the income. Wealth inequality is even more extreme, with a recent study estimating that in America, the wealthiest 160,000 families have as much as the poorest 145 million families. Such figures are rallying points for a specific strain of economic populism in America, manifested most saliently in the Occupy Wall Street movement. Occupy brought to the fore the idea that the nation is divided between a small group of haves and an increasingly large group of have-nots. But if this is really the case, why aren’t Americans taking to the streets? They are not rioting, or even organizing to demand that the government solve the problems of inequality. And, in fact, poll numbers suggest Americans believe the government spends too much on the poor or is otherwise too involved in the economy. Why do the statistics that supposedly describe the economic reality and Americans perceptions of that reality differ so much? For one, government programs do help—to a degree—cushion economic blows and redistribute wealth. But more importantly, the statistics that are trumpeted in much of the media do a poor job of describing the fluidity of the American economy. A study published in January by sociologists Thomas Hirschl of Cornell University and Mark Rank of Washington University paints a much more nuanced picture. They use data from the government-sponsored Panel Study on Income Dynamics (PSID), which interviewed thousands of families from 1968 through 2011 to understand how these families’ economic fortunes evolved over time. The data paints a picture of a fluid economic order. PSID data show that by age 60: – 70% of the population will have experienced at least one year within the top 20th percentile of income; – 53% of the population will have experienced at least one year within the top 10th percentile of income; and – 11.1% of the population will have found themselves in the much-maligned 1% of earners for at least one year of their lives. At the same time, it’s much more rare for a person to reach the top 1% and stay there. According to PSID data, only 0.6% of the population will experience 10 consecutive years in the top 1% of earners. The fluidity cuts both ways. Rank and Hirschl pointed out in their 2014 book Chasing the American Dream that some 45% of Americans will take advantage of a need-based welfare program, like Medicaid or food stamps, by age 60. And 54% of Americans will experience at least one year of poverty by the same age. Just because there is a good deal of changeability in America’s class structure, that doesn’t mean that everyone has the same chances at achieving high levels of income. Compared with many of its wealthy peers, there is much less inter-generational economic mobility in the U.S. If you are born poor in America, you have a much greater chance of staying poor than if you were born into the same class in places like Canada or Denmark. But in the American economy, a given individual will experience a wide array of economic circumstances throughout their lives. This is why, for instance, aspirational advertising campaigns are so effective: because millions of Americans really do climb the economic ladder over the course of their lives. This insight is also useful in politics. Liberals often marvel at the phenomenon of citizens in conservative states who vote “against their own economic interests.” But many of these people may very well have been in the top tiers of earners at some point in their lives, and they may expect to get back to that lofty perch again. Income and wealth inequality will continue to shape the world for years to come, and they are not issues the business community can ignore. But when you take a closer look at the data, you see that class in America is much more complicated than a simple story of the 1% against the 99%. Why aren’t Americans taking to the streets, ready to fight the next class war? It’s because many of us wouldn’t know which side we’re on.

    "text": "For the true believers in laissez faire economic policy, the recent and ongoing national discussion over income and wealth inequality probably seems like it was started as a cynical ploy for those on the left to gain a political advantage. After all, if rising inequality is a problem, you would be hard pressed to find any solutions offered by the right wing. It would be laughable to argue that left-leaning politicians aren’t using the issue for political advantage. But focusing on that fact alone misses one of the main reasons we have begun to pay more attention to inequality, which is the fact that we have better tools for measuring and understanding inequality than ever before. This is thanks to the work of economists like Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who have dedicated their careers to compiling and analyzing wealth and income data. Without these numbers, advocates for concerted effort to combat inequality would have no foundation for their argument. Saez and Zucman released another working paper this week, which studies capitalized income data to get a picture of how wealth inequality in America, rather than income inequality, has evolved since 1913. (Income inequality describes the gap in how much individuals earn from the work they do and the investments they make. Wealth inequality measures the difference in how much money and other assets individuals have accumulated altogether.) In a blog post at the London School of Economics explaining the paper, Saez and Zucman write: There is no dispute that income inequality has been on the rise in the United States for the past four decades. The share of total income earned by the top 1 percent of families was less than 10 percent in the late 1970s but now exceeds 20 percent as of the end of 2012. A large portion of this increase is due to an upsurge in the labor incomes earned by senior company executives and successful entrepreneurs. But is the rise in U.S. economic inequality purely a matter of rising labor compensation at the top, or did wealth inequality rise as well? The advent of the income tax has made measuring income much easier for economists, but measuring wealth is not as easy. To solve the problem of not having detailed government records of wealth, Saez and Zucman developed a method of capitalizing income records to estimate wealth distribution. They write: Wealth inequality, it turns out, has followed a spectacular U-shape evolution over the past 100 years. From the Great Depression in the 1930s through the late 1970s there was a substantial democratization of wealth. The trend then inverted, with the share of total household wealth owned by the top 0.1 percent increasing to 22 percent in 2012 from 7 percent in the late 1970s. The top 0.1 percent includes 160,000 families with total net assets of more than $20 million in 2012.  Saez and Zucman show that, in America, the wealthiest 160,000 families own as much wealth as the poorest 145 million families, and that wealth is about 10 times as unequal as income. They argue that the drastic rise in wealth inequality has occurred for the same reasons as income inequality; namely, the trend of making taxes less progressive since the 1970s, and a changing job market that has forced many blue collar workers to compete with cheaper labor abroad. But wealth inequality specifically is affected by a lack of saving by the middle class. Stagnant wage growth makes it difficult for middle and lower class workers to set aside money, but Saez and Zucman argue that the trend could also be a product of the ease at which people are able to get into debt, writing: Financial deregulation may have expanded borrowing opportunities (through consumer credit, home equity loans, subprime mortgages) and in some cases might have left consumers insufficiently protected against some forms of predatory lending. In that case, greater consumer protection and financial regulation could help increasing middle-class saving. Tuition increases may have increased student loans, in which case limits to university tuition fees may have a role to play. So, why should we care that wealth inequality is so much greater than even the historic levels of income inequality? While inequality is a natural result of competitive, capitalist economies, there’s plenty of evidence that shows that extreme levels of inequality is bad for business. For instance, retailers are once again bracing for a miserable holiday shopping season due mostly to the fact that most Americans simply aren’t seeing their incomes rise and have learned their lesson about the consequences of augmenting their income with debt. Unless your business caters to the richest of the rich, opportunities for real growth are scarce. Furthermore, there’s reason to believe that such levels of inequality can have even worse consequences. The late historian Tony Judt addressed these effects in Ill Fares the Land, a book on the consequences of the financial crisis, writing: There has been a collapse in intergenerational mobility: in contrast to their parents and grandparents, children today in the UK as in the US have very little expectation of improving upon the condition into which they were born. The poor stay poor. Economic disadvantage for the overwhelming majority translates into ill health, missed educational opportunity, and—increasingly—the familiar symptoms of depression: alcoholism, obesity, gambling, and minor criminality. In other words, there’s evidence that rising inequality and many other intractable social problems are related.

    "title": "Could America's Wealth Gap Lead To A Revolt?",
    "domain": "forbes.com",
    "text": "ByDr. Dale Archer, Contributor. All the talk about income and wealth inequality over the last couple of years begs the question: Could the wealth gap lead to a revolt? In some ways, last week’s fast food worker strikes and rallies affecting businesses like McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Burger King, and Yum Brand’s Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC, demonstrate it already has. In 60 cities across the country, they were protesting the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour that keeps them in a chronic state of poverty, and demanding “a living wage” of twice that. It’s extremely difficult to organize workers in such a fragmented service industry, so the fact that these demonstrations have taken place on this scale is a sign of their determination. These demands have been brewing for the past year, and are likely to spread to other industries unless the government steps in to raise the minimum wage which, given the current state of Congress, is unlikely. Regardless of your personal views on the minimum wage, the protesters may have a point. The disparity between the nation’s top earners and the bottom 80 percent has grown exponentially over the past three decades, and it’s been exacerbated by the Great Recession. For all the employment growth and claims by many that our economy is in recovery, most of those new jobs – six out of ten according to the Labor Department – are on the low end of the pay scale, which is already much lower than other first world countries. Meanwhile, the top executives of the fast food companies at the center of this storm are among the highest paid in the nation. A recent YouTube video that went viral brings home just how stark the wealth gap in America has become. According to the video, almost all of us perceive the wealth distribution as unfair, and 92% of the 5,000 Americans polled think that it should be more equitable – Republicans and Democrats alike. That’s nothing new.  However, what is striking is the vast disparity between what the average American believes the wealth gap to be, and what it actually is. The reality in graphic form shows that the bottom 40% barely register, and the top 1 percent already own more of the wealth than most Americans think the top 20% should own in a fair society. Of course, we need to differentiate between wealth and income disparity. While the top 1 percent own more than 40% of the nation’s approximately $54 trillion in wealth, they earn about 19% of the income. In other words, the rich get richer via stocks, bonds, real estate, etc. which partially accounts for the wealth gap being almost double the income gap. So an increase in the minimum wage being called for now will barely make a dent in this disparity as it stands. That leaves the bottom 80 percent with a meager 7 percent of the wealth, or, to look at it another way, the wealthiest 400 Americans have the same combined wealth of the nation’s poorest – more than 150 million people, which is almost half the population. So, no matter how you slice it, when it comes to income and wealth in America, the rich get most of the pie and the rest get the crumbs. As more Americans are confronted with evidence of this stark reality, the chances of social unrest increase. In my last blog I analyzed the protests in Brazil through the lens of human behavior, and an offshoot of equity theory I call “perceived fairness”.  In essence, people are willing to make financial decisions that are not in their own best interest in order to correct an unfair situation with another person. But that is in a one on one situation. Throw in the psychology of mob mentalityand it gets much worse. So what does this say about the current economic reality of our own American pie? And how much more inequity do we need to see before the nation’s poorest, which is the vast majority, really revolt? Aristotle was the first to state that inequality triggers a revolution and that was certainly the case during the French Revolution, when onerous taxes on the lower and middle classes enhanced the lives of the wealthiest aristocrats. The American Revolution was also about unfairness. Remember the rallying cry: “no taxation without representation”? That was in response to Americans being taxed for the gain of British. The key to this not happening here and now has always been our belief in upward mobility. As long as average Americans feel they can better their lives and rise up the social and economic ladder, they will work within the system. But, more and more, we are seeing this possibility fading in America. Fortunately, we are an aspirational society, and even the poorest among us continue to dream of climbing to the next rung. As long as the power of hope remains that anyone can better their life and grab the American dream, the status quo will be intact. But, how much longer is there going to be enough of the pie for a growing segment of the middle to lower classes of the American population to split? In Part II, I’ll discuss the burgeoning group of people in this country who have little hope outside of a life that’s on state welfare, and the danger this poses to society. I'll also discuss  the Samaritan’s dilemma which dictates that, when given a hand out, there are two types of people: those who will use the helping hand to better their lot, and those who come to rely on that charity as a way of life.

    "title": "The new class war: A wealth gap between millennials",
    "domain": "cnbc.com",
    "text": "The wealth gap between rich millennials and the rest of their age group is the largest of any generation, creating a new wave of class tension and resentment, according to a recent study.\nEven as the vast majority of millennials struggle with student debt, low-wage service-jobs, unaffordable housing and low savings, the millennial elite are surpassing previous generations. According to the study, the average millennial has 30% less wealth at the age of 35 than baby boomers did at the same age. Yet the top 10% of millennials have 20% more wealth than the top baby boomers at the same age.\n“Millennials are so different from one another that it is not particularly meaningful to talk about the ‘average’ Millennial experience,” wrote the study’s authors, Rob Gruijters, Zachary Van Winkle and Anette Eva Fasang. “There are some Millennials who are doing extremely well—think Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman—while others are struggling.”\nThe study finds that millennials — typically defined as those between the age of 28 and 43 today — have faced repeated financial headwinds. Coming of age during the financial crisis, they have lower levels of homeownership, larger debts outweighing assets, low-wage and unstable jobs, and lower rates of dual-income family formation.\nAt the same time, the authors say the top 10% of millennials have benefited from greater rewards for skilled jobs. As they put it, “The returns to high-status work trajectories have increased, while the returns to low-status trajectories have stagnated or declined.”\nThe millennials who “went to college, found graduate level jobs, and started families relatively late,” ended up with “higher levels of wealth than Baby Boomers with similar life trajectories,” according to the report.\nThe great wealth transfer\nThere may be another factor creating so much wealth among millennials: inheritances. In what’s known as “the great wealth transfer,” baby boomers are expected to pass down between $70 trillion and $90 trillion in wealth over the next 20 years. Much of that is expected to go to their millennial children. High-net-worth individuals worth $5 million or more will account for nearly half of that total, according to Cerulli Associates.\nWealth management firms say some of that wealth has already starting trickling down to the next generation.\n“The great wealth transfer, which we’ve all been talking about for the last 10 years, is underway,” said John Mathews, head of UBS’ Private Wealth Management division. “The average age of the world’s billionaires is almost 69 right now. So this whole transition or wealth handover will start to accelerate.”\nTensions between millennial classes are likely to escalate as more wealth is transferred in the coming years. Wealth displays on social media by millennial “nepo babies” could add to the intra-generational class war and drive nonwealthy millennials to overspend or create the appearance of lavish lifestyles to keep up.\nA survey by Wells Fargo found that 29% of affluent millennials (defined as having assets of $250,000 to over $1 million of investible assets) admit they “sometimes buy items they cannot afford to impress others.” According to the survey, 41% of affluent millennials admit to funding their lifestyles with credit cards or loans, versus 28% of Gen Xers and 6% of baby boomers.\nThe battle between rich millennials and the rest could also shape their attitudes toward wealth. For over four decades, the vast majority of millionaires and billionaires created in America have been self-made, mostly entrepreneurs. A study by Fidelity Investments found that 88% of American millionaires are self-made.\nYet inherited wealth could become more common. A study by UBS found that among newly minted billionaires last year, heirs who inherited their fortunes racked up more wealth than self-made billionaires for the first time in at least nine years. And, all the billionaires under the age of 30 on the latest Forbes billionaires list inherited their wealth, for the first time in 15 years.\n‘Extreme’ wealth\nThe surge in wealth among millennial heirs is also creating a lucrative new market for wealth-management firms, luxury companies, travel firms and real estate brokers.\nClayton Orrigo, one of the top luxury real estate brokers in Manhattan, has built a thriving business on moneyed millennials. The founder of the Hudson Advisory Team at Compass has sold over $4 billion in real estate and regularly brokers deals over $10 million. He says the “vast majority” of his business lately is from buyers in their 20s and 30s with inherited wealth.\n“I just sold a $16 million apartment to someone in their mid-20s, and the buyer accessed the family trust,” he said. “The wealth that is behind these kids is extreme.”\nInherited wealth has become Orrigo’s specialty. He says he works on forging close relationships with family offices, trusts and young money elite mingling at New York membership clubs like Casa Cipriani.\nThe pattern is familiar: A wealthy family calls wanting a rental for their son or daughter; a few years later, they want a $5 million or $10 million two-bedroom condo to buy in a new, high-security building downtown.\n“My gig is working very quietly and very discreetly with the wealthiest families in the world,” Orrigo said.",

He says he works on forging close relationships with family offices, trusts and young money elite mingling at New York membership clubs like Casa Cipriani.\nThe pattern is familiar: A wealthy family calls wanting a rental for their son or daughter; a few years later, they want a $5 million or $10 million two-bedroom condo to buy in a new, high-security building downtown.\n“My gig is working very quietly and very discreetly with the wealthiest families in the world,” Orrigo said.",

    "text": "In June 2010, Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates and Warren Buffett started what could be described as the world’s most ambitious fundraising drive. After promising to give away the vast majority of their wealth, the trio asked their ultra-wealthy peers to pledge at least half of their assets to charity during their lifetimes or in their estates.\nIn two months, the Giving Pledge garnered signatures from 40 of America’s richest families and individuals to sign up. That first batch of pledgers, including Michael Bloomberg and David Rockefeller, was announced 15 years ago this week.\nIn the years since, the Giving Pledge has lost steam when it comes to enrollment. By the end of 2010, 57 signatories representing an estimated 14% of America’s billionaires had made the nonbinding commitment, according to a recent report by the Institute for Policy Studies. Currently, the pledge has commitments from 256 individuals, couples and families, including 110 American billionaires, per the progressive think tank. This group makes up 12% of the U.S. billionaire population as estimated by Forbes.\nThe annual number of sign-ups has also flagged since that first year. Even in 2020 when the pandemic spurred wealthy donors to give more, the Giving Pledge only earned 12 new signatories. This past May, the pledge welcomed 11 new members, a marked improvement over 2024′s record low of four.\nMeanwhile, over the past 10 years, the number of billionaires worldwide has increased by more than half to 2,891, according to UBS. Their wealth also doubled by more than half to an estimated $15.7 trillion, UBS said.\n“It’s disappointing in that you would hope more people would step up,” said Chuck Collins, program director at the IPS and great-grandson of the meatpacker Oscar Mayer.\nCollins, a co-author of the report, said the rapid increase in wealth may be partly to blame. This surge in wealth has also made it challenging for the pledgers to give away their money fast enough.\n“Some of this is fairly sudden, the wealth growth,” he said, “so you got to give people ... a decade of slack, if you just land in the billionaire class to figure it out.”\nWhether the Giving Pledge has been successful depends on whom you ask. The IPS report described the Giving Pledge as “unfulfilled, unfulfillable, and not our ticket to a fairer, better future” and identified only one living couple to have fulfilled the pledge, John and Laura Arnold.\nA spokesperson for the Giving Pledge described the IPS report as “misleading,” and said the IPS used incomplete data and excluded “significant forms of charitable giving,” including gifts to foundations.\n“For fifteen years, the Giving Pledge has helped create new norms of generosity and grown into a connected and active global learning community,” a spokesperson wrote in a statement to Inside Wealth.\nCollins said the Giving Pledge has some merit, describing it as a “community of peers among a group who don’t have a lot of peers.”\nAmir Pasic, dean of the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, said it has had a lasting impact on how the wealthy think about their giving.\n“I still think that it was really important attempt to socialize the new wealth that was emerging early on in this century,” he said. “We can interestingly debate how successful it has or hasn’t been, but it’s become a feature of the high-net-worth philanthropic landscape.”\nThough Giving Pledge enrollment has stagnated, other efforts to accelerate giving have emerged, said Pasic, citing the collective Blue Meridian Partners.\nAnd while some billionaires, particularly younger ones, may be reluctant to associate themselves with the Gateses and Buffett, it doesn’t mean they aren’t contributing in their own way, Pasic said.\n“Buffett is the senior representative of new wealth at the beginning of this century. New representatives have emerged since then,” he said.\nAccording to Collins, impact investing and other alternatives to traditional philanthropy have gained traction, especially among the new class of tech billionaires. He gave the example of Oracle’s Larry Ellison amending his pledge to focus his resources on technology research instead of traditional nonprofit organizations.\n“I think there’s a little more blurring between for profit and nonprofit, charity versus impact investing,” Collins said.\nVenture capital billionaire Marc Andreessen has gone so far as to declare that innovating technology — and amassing personal riches in the process — is philanthropic in and of itself.\n“Who gets more value from a new technology, the single company that makes it, or the millions or billions of people who use it to improve their lives? QED,” he wrote in 2023.\nPasic said it is possible that Bill Gates’ recent commitment to give away virtually all of his wealth over the next 20 years may bring new urgency to the Giving Pledge.\n“I think that remains to be seen,” he said, “whether it’s going to end up being more of a kind of a private club that becomes less relevant or if it’ll be the beginning of something broader, gaining new energy in this turbulent time and or spawning other kinds of groups ... or other collectives.”",

    "text": "I’ve been following debates on guaranteed income for almost a decade, and one thing that’s stood out is that universal basic income (UBI), a regular cash payment to all citizens with no strings attached, is like a Rorschach test.\nSome people see UBI as a “capitalist road to communism” or a world free of work. Others see everything from a means of unleashing the population’s creative potential to a policy that would undermine human agency and erode “psychological capital.” Some see it as a way to shore up the welfare state. Others, a way to bulldoze it.\nIn part, that’s because unless you pin down the details, basic income is too vague to mean anything politically concrete. Like the Rorschach inkblot, you can interpret and design UBI in an endless variety of ways. A program that provides $250 per month is a different ballgame than one providing $1,200 per month. The same goes for one that replaces all other welfare, like food aid (sometimes referred to as a “pure UBI,” which would actually leave the most disadvantaged worse off, and is a bad idea), compared with one that complements existing programs.\nUltimately, the effects of any income guarantee hinge on the details. How much does it pay? Who gets it? How’s it financed? How does it relate to the rest of the welfare state? But most of the real proposals that have made their way through the policy world share a noteworthy trait: When the dust settles, they just wouldn’t be that radical, in either direction.\nGenerally, most people at the bottom of the income ladder would be better off, those in the middle would break even as they pay about as much in higher taxes as they’d receive from the basic income, and those at the top would be a little worse off. Society would neither ascend into utopian communism nor collapse into bleak idleness. There would just be less poverty and higher taxes.\nI see this as good news. If basic income won’t be the silver bullet that changes — or destroys — society, it becomes something far more politically tractable: a moderately effective policy, albeit one with trade-offs, that is well worth considering.\nThe many faces of basic income\nAmong actual basic income proposals, some definitely have more of a radical edge than others. But not in terms of their economic effects. What’s radical about imagining a $1,000 per month UBI isn’t so much how it’d affect the economy — again, some would be better off, others would break even, others would be worse off. It’s how to get a program with a $3 trillion price tag through a Congress that couldn’t even solidify an incredibly successful basic income for children — the temporarily expanded child tax credit — that only cost about $100 billion.\nEven if the $3 trillion version were to pass, perhaps by effectively communicating how taxing some of the benefits back would lower the program’s net cost, the result would land US federal spending as a percentage of GDP right around where France and Scandinavian countries already sit. Which is to say, from the perspective of other social democracies, that level of spending would be normal.\nOne way to blunt the more radical politics of UBI is to style the income guarantee as a negative income tax (NIT) instead. The main difference is that NIT’s are means-tested, phasing out their benefit levels as earned income rises. Doing so could lower the sticker price while achieving basically the same economic effects as a UBI considered together with higher taxes, which claw back the benefits to achieve a similar effect as the NIT means-test phasing them out.\nFor example, one 2021 proposal outlined an NIT-style basic income that guaranteed $12,500 to all adults (plus an additional $4,500 per child). The benefit would begin phasing out when household income (calculated for two-adult households) reaches $15,000, and would zero out at a household income of $70,000. It was estimated to cost $876 billion per year. Compare that to the $3-or-so trillion of high-end UBI proposals that guarantee a similar amount.\nSince NIT can be made equivalent in distribution to UBI, but the politics lean in favor of the former, there’s an argument to be made that NIT is the realistic path forward. “A leading task for the left is to legitimize the notion of a new NIT,” writes the economist Max Sawicky in an excellent overview piece. “There are genuine ways to attenuate the power of Capital … The naïve version of UBI isn’t one of them.”\nThere are, of course, other trade-offs to consider. NIT imposes a hefty administrative burden, where monthly payments would have to be tuned to fluctuating incomes. There may also be a psychological difference between phasing out benefits and paying higher taxes.\nBut if you put that whole debate aside and keep poking at the economic effects of UBI, its radical mystique continues to dissipate.\nThe general pattern of basic income’s economic impact\nAs my colleague Dylan Matthews wrote, “whether or not basic income is a good idea depends entirely on how you pay for it.” In addition, when you look at UBI together with however you propose to pay for it, you begin to see through the radical veil.\nConsider one of the most common pairings: paying for UBI with a value-added tax (VAT — sorry, another acronym), a type of consumption tax used across 170 countries worldwide, including all of Europe, leveled on all purchases, including goods and services.\nThe economist William Gale ran the numbers on coupling a 10 percent VAT with a UBI payout that would range from $2,500 for individuals to about $5,200 for a family of four. The results look like this:\nThe poorest 20 percent of Americans would see their after-tax income rise about 17 percent — a significant anti-poverty gain. The next 20 percent of Americans would see only a modest gain, roughly 5 percent. The middle 20 percent would experience basically no change. The gains from their UBI would almost perfectly cancel out the higher tax rates they’d pay. And the remaining upper classes would see modest decreases in income, with the tax costs outstripping their UBI benefits.\nWhile the numbers will vary based on the details of the proposal, the trend is general: broad-based taxation coupled with a universal payout, the basic formula of most realistic UBI proposals, tends to leave those at the bottom better off, those in the middle about even, and those at the top a little worse off. It’s not incredibly radical — it’s just an effective anti-poverty policy.\nTurning to the macroeconometric models that economists use to predict how various policy changes might affect the economy, you’ll find a similar story. Whether predicting the effects of a tax-funded UBI with the progressive-leaning Levy Institute model or the more centered Penn Wharton Budget Model, GDP and employment rates neither balloon nor crater. Neither model foretells an upheaval in the economic order of things, just a few percentage points in one direction or the other.\nWe also have suggestive empirical evidence from 2021, the year we had that UBI for kids. The results were as follows: struggling families found it easier to feed their children, pay their utility bills, invest in education, and pay the rent. Employment rates hardly budged, moving us no closer — or farther away, depending on your tastes — to a world without work. (Though, to be fair, a program everyone knows is temporary likely has less impact on employment than if it were permanent.)\nRadical ideas have their place. They can stretch our collective imagination, and keep us from falling victim to the belief that there are no fundamental alternatives to the present arrangement of our world. But basic income doesn’t have to be one of them, and shedding that association offers at least two payoffs.\nIt could bring basic income further into the realm of pragmatic policy analysis, where wonks of all stripes present their views on whether or not the programs’ tradeoffs are worth it. Second, for those who want to elevate their sights on radical possibilities that might exceed political realities, why not dream bigger?",

Doing so could lower the sticker price while achieving basically the same economic effects as a UBI considered together with higher taxes, which claw back the benefits to achieve a similar effect as the NIT means-test phasing them out.\nFor example, one 2021 proposal outlined an NIT-style basic income that guaranteed $12,500 to all adults (plus an additional $4,500 per child). The benefit would begin phasing out when household income (calculated for two-adult households) reaches $15,000, and would zero out at a household income of $70,000. It was estimated to cost $876 billion per year. Compare that to the $3-or-so trillion of high-end UBI proposals that guarantee a similar amount.\nSince NIT can be made equivalent in distribution to UBI, but the politics lean in favor of the former, there’s an argument to be made that NIT is the realistic path forward. “A leading task for the left is to legitimize the notion of a new NIT,” writes the economist Max Sawicky in an excellent overview piece. “There are genuine ways to attenuate the power of Capital … The naïve version of UBI isn’t one of them.”\nThere are, of course, other trade-offs to consider. NIT imposes a hefty administrative burden, where monthly payments would have to be tuned to fluctuating incomes. There may also be a psychological difference between phasing out benefits and paying higher taxes.\nBut if you put that whole debate aside and keep poking at the economic effects of UBI, its radical mystique continues to dissipate.\nThe general pattern of basic income’s economic impact\nAs my colleague Dylan Matthews wrote, “whether or not basic income is a good idea depends entirely on how you pay for it.” In addition, when you look at UBI together with however you propose to pay for it, you begin to see through the radical veil.\nConsider one of the most common pairings: paying for UBI with a value-added tax (VAT — sorry, another acronym), a type of consumption tax used across 170 countries worldwide, including all of Europe, leveled on all purchases, including goods and services.\nThe economist William Gale ran the numbers on coupling a 10 percent VAT with a UBI payout that would range from $2,500 for individuals to about $5,200 for a family of four. The results look like this:\nThe poorest 20 percent of Americans would see their after-tax income rise about 17 percent — a significant anti-poverty gain. The next 20 percent of Americans would see only a modest gain, roughly 5 percent. The middle 20 percent would experience basically no change. The gains from their UBI would almost perfectly cancel out the higher tax rates they’d pay. And the remaining upper classes would see modest decreases in income, with the tax costs outstripping their UBI benefits.\nWhile the numbers will vary based on the details of the proposal, the trend is general: broad-based taxation coupled with a universal payout, the basic formula of most realistic UBI proposals, tends to leave those at the bottom better off, those in the middle about even, and those at the top a little worse off. It’s not incredibly radical — it’s just an effective anti-poverty policy.\nTurning to the macroeconometric models that economists use to predict how various policy changes might affect the economy, you’ll find a similar story. Whether predicting the effects of a tax-funded UBI with the progressive-leaning Levy Institute model or the more centered Penn Wharton Budget Model, GDP and employment rates neither balloon nor crater. Neither model foretells an upheaval in the economic order of things, just a few percentage points in one direction or the other.\nWe also have suggestive empirical evidence from 2021, the year we had that UBI for kids. The results were as follows: struggling families found it easier to feed their children, pay their utility bills, invest in education, and pay the rent. Employment rates hardly budged, moving us no closer — or farther away, depending on your tastes — to a world without work. (Though, to be fair, a program everyone knows is temporary likely has less impact on employment than if it were permanent.)\nRadical ideas have their place. They can stretch our collective imagination, and keep us from falling victim to the belief that there are no fundamental alternatives to the present arrangement of our world. But basic income doesn’t have to be one of them, and shedding that association offers at least two payoffs.\nIt could bring basic income further into the realm of pragmatic policy analysis, where wonks of all stripes present their views on whether or not the programs’ tradeoffs are worth it. Second, for those who want to elevate their sights on radical possibilities that might exceed political realities, why not dream bigger?",

    "title": "Why everyone is talking about free cash handouts—an explainer on universal basic income",
    "domain": "cnbc.com",
    "text": "The idea of free cash for all may seem too good to be true, but a growing number of high-profile people — from Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang to tech billionaire Elon Musk — say universal basic income, or UBI, may become a reality.\nAnd the rest of America is becoming more interested, too: Google searches for the term “universal basic income” have multiplied as much as 50 times between 2015 and 2019.\nWhat is UBI?\nUniversal basic income refers to regular cash payments made to a given population (such as adult U.S. citizens, for example) with minimal or no requirements for receiving the money, in order to increase people’s income, according to the International Monetary Fund.\nBeyond that, however, there is often disagreement about what constitutes UBI.\n″[T]here is no established common understanding” of UBI, according to economists Maura Francese and Delphine Prady. And therefore, “very different income-support programs are often labeled ‘universal basic income,’ even when they have little in common or do not aim at the same goal.”\nHowever, common variances on the basic tenet include whether cash handouts replace or supplement existing social welfare programs, whether payments are distributed to a household or individual, who foots the bill and how often the payments are distributed.\nWhy is everybody talking about UBI now?\nThere are two main conditions fueling the emergence of UBI as a serious topic over the last few years.\nThe first is fears that automation will put millions of people out of work, leaving them with little or no income.\n“There is a pretty good chance we end up with a universal basic income, or something like that, due to automation,” SpaceX and Tesla boss Elon Musk told CNBC in 2016. “Yeah, I am not sure what else one would do. I think that is what would happen.”\nThis is Andrew Yang’s thinking too. Yang, a 44-year-old entrepreneur running for the Democratic presidential nomination, has made UBI the foundation of his 2020 campaign platform. His plan, which he calls the “Freedom Dividend,” is for the federal government to give all U.S. citizens ages 18 and over $1,000 per month.\nFellow Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders said in 2015 he is “absolutely sympathetic to that approach,” and former Vice President Joe Biden said in 2018 he would consider a UBI as a last resort. Republicans are more likely to be against UBI.\nAmericans, however, are split on whether they would support universal basic income as a solution for those whose jobs are replaced by robots: 48% support and 52% do not, according to a February 2018 Gallup survey.\nThere is also debate as to whether robots will actually take people’s jobs: A 2017 McKinsey & Company report estimates as much as one-third of the U.S. workforce may need to learn new skills and find a new job because of automation by 2030, while a 2017 report from Gartner says artificial intelligence will create more jobs than it eliminates.\nThe other major situation motivating the current conversation about UBI is America’s extreme and growing wealth inequality. Some see cash payments as a way to help even the playing field.\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, for one, falls into this camp.\n“Every generation expands its definition of equality. Now it’s time for our generation to define a new social contract .... We should explore ideas like universal basic income to make sure everyone has a cushion to try new ideas,” Zuckerberg said in his 2017 Harvard commencement speech. After all, he said, it was because he had a financial safety net from his dentist father that he felt free to try something as risky as turning Facebook into a business.\nThe wave of interest in UBI is also inspiring a smattering of experiments and pilot studies with UBI in the U.S.\nThe once-bankrupt town of Stockton, California, initiated an 18-month experiment in February, distributing monthly checks for $500 to 130 randomly selected Stockton residents to mitigate poverty and inequality. Michael Tubbs, the town’s now 28-year-old mayor, decided on the program after reading Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1967 book, “Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?” In the book, King writes: ”... the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.”\nAnd one of the country’s top start-up accelerators’ research arm, Y Combinator Research, has run small-scale tests in Oakland, California, to test and improve procedures ahead of a larger-scale program. In that program, 1,000 randomly selected individuals across two as-yet-undisclosed states will receive $1,000 per month for three years to study the impact of the cash transfer.\nWho pays?\nThat depends on who you talk to.\nHillary Clinton seriously considered running her 2016 campaign for president on a platform built with UBI. But she couldn’t figure out a reasonable way to pay for it.\n“Unfortunately, we couldn’t make the numbers work,” Clinton wrote in her campaign memoir, “What Happened.” “To provide a meaningful dividend each year to every citizen, you’d have to raise enormous sums of money, and that would either mean a lot of new taxes or cannibalizing other important programs. We decided it was exciting but not realistic....”\nOthers believe there is a solution.\nFacebook co-founder Chris Hughes, a UBI supporter, says a guaranteed basic income should be paid for by the wealthiest 1% of society, according to his book, “Fair Shot: Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn.”\nTWEET: Recurring cash payments, directly to the people who need it most, are a proven tool to beat back against the rising tide of #IncomeInequality.\nAnd Yang proposes to pay for UBI by implementing a value-added tax, or VAT, of 10% on goods and services a company produces. “Because our economy is so vast, this would generate between $700 and $800 billion in revenue,” he said on Reddit in 2018. Indeed, Eric Toder of the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Policy Center told CNBC Make It in 2018 that such a VAT in the United States could raise anywhere from $500 billion to $1 trillion, depending on how broadly the tax is applied.\nOne thing is certain, however: It would cost a lot.\n“A truly universal UBI would be enormously expensive,” say Hilary Hoynes and Jesse Rothstein, economics and public policy professors at the University of California at Berkeley. “The kinds of UBIs often discussed would cost nearly double current total spending on the ‘big three’ programs (Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid),” according to their working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in February. They also say these social welfare programs would still be needed even with UBI.\nWill it work?\nCritics say universal basic income is too expensive, that it gives people incentive to be unproductive, that it’s bad for people’s self-worth and that there are more efficient ways to spend government money to help those who can’t support themselves.\n“Just giving $1,000 to everybody in itself is not the right solution” if helping those who need it most in society is the goal, Thomas Piketty, an economist and professor at the Paris School of Economics, told CNBC Make It at Columbia University in March.\nAnd Ian Goldin, a professor of globalization and development at the University of Oxford, argued in the Financial Times that “individuals gain not only income, but meaning, status, skills, networks and friendships through work. Delinking income and work, while rewarding people for staying at home, is what lies behind social decay.”\nNobel laureate in economics Joseph Stiglitz told CNBC in April, “I think there’s a certain dignity from work. Some of my younger students say, ‘Oh there could be a lot of dignity from meditation and from other ways of spending time.’ But I think for most people there will be a real desire to work,” Stiglitz says.\nAs far as the data goes, it’s mixed.\nSome of the news seems positive. For example, left-leaning think tank Roosevelt Institute says a $1,000-a-month payment would actually grow the economy by $2.5 trillion by 2025 if it was paid for by increasing the federal deficit; however, increasing taxes would have no net benefit to the economy.\nAnd some small UBI use cases seem to show that cash handouts help those who receive them in some ways — alleviating emotional stress and helping individuals pay their bills. However, it is not a silver bullet for unemployment.\nFor instance, preliminary results of a two-year experiment in Finland that gave 2,000 unemployed people 560 euros ($638) a month show that, for the first year of the study, 2017, those getting cash payments reported improved well-being. However, there was no effect on employment status. Results for employment status in 2018, the second year of the study, are not yet available.\nA basic income pilot program in Ontario, Canada, launched in April 2017 with a plan to distribute varying monthly payments to more than 4,000 people living on incomes less than $34,000 Canadian (or about $25,925 U.S.) for up to three years via tax credits. In July, the government of Ontario announced it would shut down the program (due to the cost and a change in government leadership), and in August, it said that payments would run through March. But the advocacy group Basic Income Canada Network got some feedback. Responses from 424 participants indicated the payments gave them increased personal agency, relief from anxiety, increased social connection and the ability to invest in things like education and job-hunting.\nThen there are the residents of Alaska, who receive a yearly dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which was launched in 1982 to pass along oil profits to future generations. In 2018, the payment was $1,600. Alaskans reportedly use the money for everything from heating oil and clothing to medical emergencies, travel and student loan payments. And a 2018 study of Alaskans suggests that “a universal and permanent cash transfer does not significantly decrease aggregate employment.”",

    "text": "2019 was the year many asked the question: Should billionaires exist?\nIncome inequality in the United States is at its highest level in at least 50 years, according to one measurement from the government’s Census Bureau. In January, Oxfam reported that the world’s wealthiest 26 individuals, as of 2018, had the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of the population.\nThere were 2,153 billionaires as of March, with the ultra-rich worth $8.7 trillion, according to Forbes.\nIt’s against this backdrop that a number of billionaires addressed the issue of inequality, some with progressive agendas to improve American capitalism, the same system that allowed them to become some of the world’s wealthiest people.\nBill Gates\nNet worth: $108.1 billion, according to Forbes\nWhat he said: “There’s no free lunch here. You’d have to collect more money,” Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in February, about raising taxes. “As you go about doing this additional collection, of course you want to be progressive. You want the portion that comes from the top 1% or top 20% to be much higher,” Gates said.\nEven as he supports higher taxes, Gates believes in the fundamentals of capitalism: “You have market-based pricing. You let people create new companies very easily,” Gates told Zakaria. “If you think there’s a lot of competition someplace, you come in and intervene on that.”\nThat system should not be overturned, he said.\n“Flirting with radical change, dramatic change, how we run these systems, I personally — my vote will be not to make a radical change,” he said.\n“Now you can say I’m biased because this system has worked very well for me, and I feel — I plead guilty to that. But as I look overall at the capitalist economies, there are a lot of good things ... and I think you can tune the tax parameters and get way more equity and get some additional government services and still be in the same basic framework,” he said.\nRay Dalio\nNet worth: $18.7 billion, according to Forbes\nWhat he said: “Capitalism needs to be reformed. It doesn’t need to be abandoned. So like anything, like a car, like anything, a plane, a school system, anything, it needs to be reformed in order to work better,” Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest and most profitable hedge fund, said in July on CBS’ “60 Minutes,” explaining that the U.S. economy is not “redistributing opportunity.”\nDalio went as far as to say, “I think the American dream is lost.”\nThe current situation is not sustainable, according to Dalio: “We’re at a juncture. We can do it together, or we will do it in conflict, that there will be a conflict between the rich and the poor,” Dalio said.\nIn November on LinkedIn, Dalio spoke out again, saying, “The world has gone mad and the system is broken. ... Because the ‘trickle-down’ process of having money at the top trickle down to workers and others by improving their earnings and creditworthiness is not working, the system of making capitalism work well for most people is broken.”\nMarc Benioff\nNet worth: $6.9 billion, according to Forbes\nWhat he said: “Capitalism, I acknowledge, has been good to me,” Mark Benioff, the co-founder of Salesforce, wrote in The New York Times in November. “But capitalism as it has been practiced in recent decades — with its obsession on maximizing profits for shareholders — has also led to horrifying inequality.”\nBenioff’s op-ed in the Times calls for a “new capitalism,” which among other things would include higher taxes on America’s richest, including himself. “Nationally, increasing taxes on high-income individuals like myself would help generate the trillions of dollars that we desperately need to improve education and health care and fight climate change,” he wrote.\nMark Zuckerberg\nNet worth: $75.7 billion, according to Forbes\nWhat he said: “I don’t know if I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have, but at some level no one deserves to have that much money,” Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said of billionaires during a live-streamed question and answer session in October. “I think if you do something that is good, you get rewarded, but I do think some of the wealth that can be accumulated is unreasonable.”\nHe also said extreme wealth at the hands of a few, if they choose to spend it to better society, might be better than the alternative of the government controlling all of the wealth. “At some level it is not fair, but it may be optimal,” he said, “or better than the alternative. The alternative would be the government chooses all of the funding for all of the stuff.”\n(Some experts have argued that even through philanthropy, the rich have a disproportionate or unfair influence on society, and Rob Reich, a political theorist at Stanford and author of “Just Giving: Why Philanthropy Is Failing Democracy and How It Can Do Better,” even called it “plutocratic.”)\nMark Cuban\nNet worth: $4.1 billion, according to Forbes\nWhat he said: “The biggest issue for entrepreneurs, for capitalists, for those of us who are successful is, if someone is only going to be paid by the hour ... they’re always going to fall behind,” Cuban told Recode Decode with Kara Swisher at the 2019 SALT Conference in Las Vegas in June. “And income distribution is … [the] disparity is going to get wider and wider.”\nSo, said Cuban, “We as entrepreneurs have got to make a point to give stock to everybody that works for us. Period. End of story. No exceptions, because that’s the only way people are going to get any type of equity appreciation.”\n“Capitalism isn’t bad. It’s when capitalists don’t pay attention” that “bad things can happen,” Cuban said. “Our country is a lot like running a business ... you can’t just look at the short term in the immediate aspect, you’ve got to look at the long term.”\nWarren Buffett\nNet worth: $88.8 billion, according to Forbes\nWhat he said: “I’m a card-carrying capitalist,” Buffett told Andrew Ross Sorkin in May at the annual meeting for the investing firm which he heads, Berkshire Hathaway. The Omaha weekend event is called “Woodstock for Capitalists,” Sorkin notes in his column in the New York Times.\n“I believe we wouldn’t be sitting here except for the market system,” he told Sorkin. “I don’t think the country will go into socialism in 2020 or 2040 or 2060.”\nBuffett supports capitalism because the market economy is productive and generates wealth.\n″[T]he most important single thing is to have more ‘golden eggs’ to distribute around,” Buffett said in February in an interview with CNBC’s Becky Quick. “So I don’t wanna do anything to the goose that lays the golden eggs. And we’ve had the goose that lays more and more golden eggs over the years, unbelievable in this country.”\n“So we’ve got something that works in terms of the market system in terms of turning out lots of goods and services people want,” Buffett said.\nThat being said, Buffett also says the United States ought to use the wealth generated by that “golden goose” to take care of those who are otherwise good people but don’t have skills that the market economy values.\n“A rich family can handle if they’ve got six children and one of them isn’t as good in the market ... is just good in every other personal quality. They take care of him,” Buffett told Quick. “So we can take care of people and we should. But we shouldn’t screw up the market system.”\nJamie Dimon\nNet worth: $1.7 billion, according to Forbes\nWhat he said: Socialism is not a viable solution, said Dimon in his annual letter to shareholders published in April.\n“When governments control companies, economic assets (companies, lenders and so on) over time are used to further political interests – leading to inefficient companies and markets, enormous favoritism and corruption,” Dimon wrote in the letter, which was released with the bank’s 2018 annual report.\n“Socialism inevitably produces stagnation, corruption and often worse – such as authoritarian government officials who often have an increasing ability to interfere with both the economy and individual lives – which they frequently do to maintain power. This would be as much a disaster for our country as it has been in the other places it’s been tried,” he added.\nThe CEO of JPMorgan Chase was unequivocal in his support of capitalism as the best, yet still imperfect, economic system.\n“There is no question that capitalism has been the most successful economic system the world has ever seen. It has helped lift billions of people out of poverty, and it has helped enhance the wealth, health and education of people around the world. Capitalism enables competition, innovation and choice,” Dimon wrote.\nThat being said, like Buffett, Dimon also said the governments of capitalistic economies ought to support those who are struggle.\n“This is not to say that capitalism does not have flaws, that it isn’t leaving people behind and that it shouldn’t be improved. It’s essential to have a strong social safety net – and all countries should be striving for continuous improvement in regulations as well as social and welfare conditions,” Dimon wrote.",

    "title": "America Has Never Been Wealthier. Here’s Why It Doesn’t Feel That Way.",
    "domain": "nytimes.com",
    "text": "America is more prosperous than ever.\nU.S. household net worth reached a new peak at the end of 2024. The unemployment rate has levitated just above record lows for three years. The overall debt that households are carrying compared with the assets they own is also near a record low.\nBut even a land of plenty has its shortcomings, influencing both perceptions and realities of how Americans are doing.\nThe U.S. economy remains deeply unequal, with vast gaps in wealth and financial security persisting even as inflation has ebbed and incomes have risen. And data designed to capture the overall population may be obscuring challenges experienced by a broad range of Americans, especially those in the bottom half of the wealth or income spectrum.\nThe share of wealth held by families in the top 10 percent has reached 69 percent, while the share held by families in the bottom 50 percent is only 3 percent, according to the latest reading from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. (When future income claims from Social Security benefits are included, the bottom 50 percent hold 6 percent of total wealth.)\nAnd while wealth has risen for the less wealthy half of the population in recent years, much of the uptick has been locked up in what financial analysts call “illiquid assets” — gains in home prices and stock portfolios — which are not easily translated into cash to pay for bills and expenses that are much higher than they were a few years ago.\nAlthough the bottom 50 percent holds only a 1 percent share of all financial market wealth, six in 10 adults report owning some amount of stock. A broad range of Americans may be frustrated by the inaccessibility of this illiquid wealth, said Daniel Sullivan, research director at the JPMorganChase Institute, which tracks the finances of millions of U.S. bank account holders.\n“‘Massive home equity gains, and my 401(k) is way up, but I can’t touch that, either!’” Mr. Sullivan explained, channeling the tension many people feel.\nDespite the growth in overall wealth, economic confidence among American households has not returned to where it was before the pandemic. That was the case even before consumer sentiment readings — along with the stock market — were dampened by the prospect of an inflationary global trade war from President Trump’s tariff campaign. But what is also striking in the data is the increasing gap in perceptions along income lines.\nOver the past four years, the University of Michigan’s monthly survey of consumer sentiment has shown those in the bottom two-thirds of income to be deeply pessimistic about the economy — with rock-bottom ratings more common during periods of deep recession, including the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn contrast, sentiment among the top third of earners recently rebounded after falling from prepandemic levels.\n“Higher-income people drive most of aggregate spending,” said Joanne Hsu, an economist and director of the Michigan survey. “They were on an upward surge of sentiment between 2022 and 2024, and that’s consistent with their strong spending.”\nPart of the disconnect may stem from the tendency among economists to track income progress primarily through percentage change rather than dollar amounts.\nEven when inflation was peaking around 9 percent and diluting income growth, Ms. Hsu explained, “a 10 percent boost to middle and especially higher incomes is money that feels real, like you can do something with it.”\nFor someone making $100,000, that means a $10,000 raise. But a 10 percent increase at the bottom, perhaps to an hourly wage of $16.50 from $15, “means you’re still living hand-to-mouth,” she added.\nIn a recent report, Matt Bruenig, the president of the People’s Policy Project, a liberal think tank, evaluated the long-running question in U.S. economics of how many adults are living paycheck to paycheck — a term plagued, he said, by “inherent ambiguities.”\nDrawing on data from the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, conducted annually by the Federal Reserve Board, Mr. Bruenig noted that “if we define someone as living paycheck to paycheck if they either say they do not have three months of emergency savings or say they cannot afford a $2,000 emergency expense,” then 59 percent of American adults are “living paycheck to paycheck.”\n‘Loss Aversion’\nOne force behind the lingering dour mood may be more psychic, more intangible, than economic data can easily detect, according to Chris Wheat, the president of the JPMorganChase Institute.\nLess wealthy Americans, both middle and working class, he said, may still be reckoning with “the psychological effect” of the volatility brought about by the pandemic and postpandemic period of 2020 to 2023, which brought both positive and negative swings in cash savings.\nLump sums of direct federal aid in 2020 and 2021 helped tens of millions of households pay down debts, save more of their income and get a brief taste of what living standards were like well above their usual income.\nThat aid, as expected, ended. And there has been a harsh comedown from those highs.\nInflation-adjusted income and inflation-adjusted spending for the typical household fell significantly from 2021 to 2023, research from the JPMorganChase Institute found, using data from more than eight million bank account holders. In essence, purchasing power decreased.\nDuring the same period, checking account balances remained in a historically healthy position across all income cohorts. Yet cash savings have fallen ever since peaking in 2021.\nA variety of goods and services have become more expensive, “but people’s spending habits didn’t change,” Mr. Wheat said.\nWhen financial gravity resumed, lower- and middle-income households that had received aid were forced to resume relying primarily on their labor income to cover expenses.\nThat, Mr. Wheat said, appears to have prompted a serious case of what both psychologists and economists call “loss aversion” — the human proneness to more painfully feel what has been lost than to notice what has been gained. The earnings growth that most workers captured, to average hourly earnings of $31 in January 2025 from $23 in January 2019, didn’t feel as good as inflation felt bad.\nMost economists believe it was appropriate for the extraordinary aid of 2020-21 that enlarged household bank accounts to end. And some argued that it should have ended sooner.\nBut being nudged back into tighter budgeting again, after gaining more financial breathing room, however briefly, can be “frustrating,” Mr. Wheat noted.\nHouse-Rich(er), Cash-Thin(ner)\nHome prices have boomed since 2020. And about half the net worth of the less wealthy 50 percent is in real estate. But the major boost in home prices experienced by owners in this half of the population has often not been felt.\nFor one, a higher home appraisal cannot cover higher grocery bills. And with interest rates high and housing scarce, it is often infeasible to buy a first home or move to another one.\nThat, too, is probably suppressing economic sentiment among those with fewer financial resources in their family, Ms. Hsu of the University of Michigan said.\nThe homeownership rate for adults under 35, which peaked in 1980 at 50 percent, has fallen to 30 percent. Estimates from economists at the National Association of Home Builders in 2024 indicated that about half of American households could not afford a $250,000 home and that a large majority could not afford a median-priced home, now $419,000.\nThe state of the housing market — largely frozen for about three years — may be dimming the economic outlook of even higher-income families. A large crop of homeowners over the past couple of years have been looking to move, for family or work. Rationally, they cherish their cheap, fixed-rate mortgages from the era of lower interest rates, and catch sticker shock at the prospective monthly payment for a similar home at present rates and prices.\nOne fascinating divot in the broader personal finance landscape, however, is that elevated interest rates — which have a dampening effect on industries like housing — have given a major personal income boost to millions of households, if only those that have an ability to save (after taxes and expenses).\nResearch teams at large U.S. banks are finding that these savers are allocating a greater proportion of their cash balances to high-yield savings accounts that earn more interest, a direct result of higher interest rates. Personal interest income hit a record high of $2.1 trillion in January.\nSo for high-income households, total cash reserves are most likely much higher even if checking account balances are down, a report from the JPMorganChase Institute notes.\nFor lower-income bank account holders, “it’s not dark, but it’s not quite as rosy,” Mr. Sullivan concluded.\nThe Shadow of Tariffs\nHistorically, consumer sentiment tends to improve after an inflation shock, or a recession, with the passage of time during economic expansions. It gives households a chance to adjust to new prices, or a new job market, and move forward.\nBut a large and diverse group of economists and investors are arguing that the zigzagging nature of Mr. Trump’s tariff campaign is needlessly adding inflation danger and growth uncertainty to the relatively stable path that the economy was on before he re-entered office.\nThe financial market sell-off this past month and recent plummets in sentiment have “been driven by policy uncertainty largely stemming from tariffs and tariff threats,” said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.\nThe president and his advisers, however, have presented any potential recession, or uptick in consumer inflation that may result from their policies, as a price that may need to be paid for the economy to emerge stronger.\nBelief in Mr. Trump’s ability to steer the economy played a key part in his election victory. And he promised to lower prices and ease the cost of living upon entering office. But public approval of his handling of the economy is only 39 percent, with just 32 percent of respondents approving of his approach to the cost of living, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.\nFinancial forecasters at major Wall Street firms have, for their part, taken their previously low recession probability ratings and raised them significantly.\nBut several analysts remain focused less on recession calls than on trying to make sense of why so many people are feeling down about their economic lives.\nOwen Davis, a labor economist and research fellow at the Siegel Family Endowment — a nonprofit that funds education and work force research — believes that questions of economic dissatisfaction and the constant deliberation in recent years over whether the U.S. economy is, or isn’t, heading into a recession “often get lumped together” in unhelpful ways.\n“We need to be able to have two different conversations about the economy,” Mr. Davis argues — one about the overall size, steadiness and direction of “the ship,” and another about its quality.\n“We need to be able to distinguish between the question of whether the ship is sinking,” he said, “and the question of whether the accommodations on the ship are adequate.”",

But what is also striking in the data is the increasing gap in perceptions along income lines.\nOver the past four years, the University of Michigan’s monthly survey of consumer sentiment has shown those in the bottom two-thirds of income to be deeply pessimistic about the economy — with rock-bottom ratings more common during periods of deep recession, including the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn contrast, sentiment among the top third of earners recently rebounded after falling from prepandemic levels.\n“Higher-income people drive most of aggregate spending,” said Joanne Hsu, an economist and director of the Michigan survey. “They were on an upward surge of sentiment between 2022 and 2024, and that’s consistent with their strong spending.”\nPart of the disconnect may stem from the tendency among economists to track income progress primarily through percentage change rather than dollar amounts.\nEven when inflation was peaking around 9 percent and diluting income growth, Ms. Hsu explained, “a 10 percent boost to middle and especially higher incomes is money that feels real, like you can do something with it.”\nFor someone making $100,000, that means a $10,000 raise. But a 10 percent increase at the bottom, perhaps to an hourly wage of $16.50 from $15, “means you’re still living hand-to-mouth,” she added.\nIn a recent report, Matt Bruenig, the president of the People’s Policy Project, a liberal think tank, evaluated the long-running question in U.S. economics of how many adults are living paycheck to paycheck — a term plagued, he said, by “inherent ambiguities.”\nDrawing on data from the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, conducted annually by the Federal Reserve Board, Mr. Bruenig noted that “if we define someone as living paycheck to paycheck if they either say they do not have three months of emergency savings or say they cannot afford a $2,000 emergency expense,” then 59 percent of American adults are “living paycheck to paycheck.”\n‘Loss Aversion’\nOne force behind the lingering dour mood may be more psychic, more intangible, than economic data can easily detect, according to Chris Wheat, the president of the JPMorganChase Institute.\nLess wealthy Americans, both middle and working class, he said, may still be reckoning with “the psychological effect” of the volatility brought about by the pandemic and postpandemic period of 2020 to 2023, which brought both positive and negative swings in cash savings.\nLump sums of direct federal aid in 2020 and 2021 helped tens of millions of households pay down debts, save more of their income and get a brief taste of what living standards were like well above their usual income.\nThat aid, as expected, ended. And there has been a harsh comedown from those highs.\nInflation-adjusted income and inflation-adjusted spending for the typical household fell significantly from 2021 to 2023, research from the JPMorganChase Institute found, using data from more than eight million bank account holders. In essence, purchasing power decreased.\nDuring the same period, checking account balances remained in a historically healthy position across all income cohorts. Yet cash savings have fallen ever since peaking in 2021.\nA variety of goods and services have become more expensive, “but people’s spending habits didn’t change,” Mr. Wheat said.\nWhen financial gravity resumed, lower- and middle-income households that had received aid were forced to resume relying primarily on their labor income to cover expenses.\nThat, Mr. Wheat said, appears to have prompted a serious case of what both psychologists and economists call “loss aversion” — the human proneness to more painfully feel what has been lost than to notice what has been gained. The earnings growth that most workers captured, to average hourly earnings of $31 in January 2025 from $23 in January 2019, didn’t feel as good as inflation felt bad.\nMost economists believe it was appropriate for the extraordinary aid of 2020-21 that enlarged household bank accounts to end. And some argued that it should have ended sooner.\nBut being nudged back into tighter budgeting again, after gaining more financial breathing room, however briefly, can be “frustrating,” Mr. Wheat noted.\nHouse-Rich(er), Cash-Thin(ner)\nHome prices have boomed since 2020. And about half the net worth of the less wealthy 50 percent is in real estate. But the major boost in home prices experienced by owners in this half of the population has often not been felt.\nFor one, a higher home appraisal cannot cover higher grocery bills. And with interest rates high and housing scarce, it is often infeasible to buy a first home or move to another one.\nThat, too, is probably suppressing economic sentiment among those with fewer financial resources in their family, Ms. Hsu of the University of Michigan said.\nThe homeownership rate for adults under 35, which peaked in 1980 at 50 percent, has fallen to 30 percent. Estimates from economists at the National Association of Home Builders in 2024 indicated that about half of American households could not afford a $250,000 home and that a large majority could not afford a median-priced home, now $419,000.\nThe state of the housing market — largely frozen for about three years — may be dimming the economic outlook of even higher-income families. A large crop of homeowners over the past couple of years have been looking to move, for family or work. Rationally, they cherish their cheap, fixed-rate mortgages from the era of lower interest rates, and catch sticker shock at the prospective monthly payment for a similar home at present rates and prices.\nOne fascinating divot in the broader personal finance landscape, however, is that elevated interest rates — which have a dampening effect on industries like housing — have given a major personal income boost to millions of households, if only those that have an ability to save (after taxes and expenses).\nResearch teams at large U.S. banks are finding that these savers are allocating a greater proportion of their cash balances to high-yield savings accounts that earn more interest, a direct result of higher interest rates. Personal interest income hit a record high of $2.1 trillion in January.\nSo for high-income households, total cash reserves are most likely much higher even if checking account balances are down, a report from the JPMorganChase Institute notes.\nFor lower-income bank account holders, “it’s not dark, but it’s not quite as rosy,” Mr. Sullivan concluded.\nThe Shadow of Tariffs\nHistorically, consumer sentiment tends to improve after an inflation shock, or a recession, with the passage of time during economic expansions. It gives households a chance to adjust to new prices, or a new job market, and move forward.\nBut a large and diverse group of economists and investors are arguing that the zigzagging nature of Mr. Trump’s tariff campaign is needlessly adding inflation danger and growth uncertainty to the relatively stable path that the economy was on before he re-entered office.\nThe financial market sell-off this past month and recent plummets in sentiment have “been driven by policy uncertainty largely stemming from tariffs and tariff threats,” said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.\nThe president and his advisers, however, have presented any potential recession, or uptick in consumer inflation that may result from their policies, as a price that may need to be paid for the economy to emerge stronger.\nBelief in Mr. Trump’s ability to steer the economy played a key part in his election victory. And he promised to lower prices and ease the cost of living upon entering office. But public approval of his handling of the economy is only 39 percent, with just 32 percent of respondents approving of his approach to the cost of living, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.\nFinancial forecasters at major Wall Street firms have, for their part, taken their previously low recession probability ratings and raised them significantly.\nBut several analysts remain focused less on recession calls than on trying to make sense of why so many people are feeling down about their economic lives.\nOwen Davis, a labor economist and research fellow at the Siegel Family Endowment — a nonprofit that funds education and work force research — believes that questions of economic dissatisfaction and the constant deliberation in recent years over whether the U.S. economy is, or isn’t, heading into a recession “often get lumped together” in unhelpful ways.\n“We need to be able to have two different conversations about the economy,” Mr. Davis argues — one about the overall size, steadiness and direction of “the ship,” and another about its quality.\n“We need to be able to distinguish between the question of whether the ship is sinking,” he said, “and the question of whether the accommodations on the ship are adequate.”",
